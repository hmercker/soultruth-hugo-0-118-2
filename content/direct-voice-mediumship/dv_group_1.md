# Direct Voice Group 1


So, a circle of seven sitters were called to sit in circle for this purpose. Each person joined with the understanding that it would take a great deal of commitment and effort to accomplish materialization of Celestial spirits in daylight. Although daylight materializations of high spirits have been known to occur, they are very rare indeed.  The transfiguration on the mount with Jesus being flanked by Elijah and Moses in spirit being the most famous incident. Consistent and numerous materializations are unheard of with the exception of those spirits who inhabit much lower spheres. We have met periodically in one location several times for two weeks to two months of intensive sessions, both in a darkened room and outside of it. 

Our spirit leader and guide on this project is an ancient Egyptian named Seretta Kem. He is a powerful healer and spirit chemist who has been involved with our Divine Love circles in Western Canada for decades. He has a keen interest in developing mediums for the purpose of trans communication with Celestials and also in other forms of communication such as Direct voice. He is a key player in this development work and has shared through a medium a great deal of information on the subject as has many others. These messages have filled five volumes of guidance and commentary about our mutual progress and development in Direct Voice. For those interested in material communication from spirits, this section offers some invaluable insights into the process. Rather than focusing exclusively on mental/material mediumship which is the standard approach, the Celestials have also explained the importance of Divine love within the souls of those involved suggesting that with an adequate amount of this Divine energy, we can be successful in producing the results intended. Indeed as explained [in this message,](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2018/direct-voice-clarified-af-10-oct-2018/) this particular style of manifestation is not ectoplasmic in nature. And while the manifestations will be perceivable by the normal senses of mankind, it is not truly material. However Jesus, as and when he materialises, has his own unique gifts that may alter the results he achieves.


These are the messages received as a part of the First Direct Voice project - well that we have arranged - as opposed to the very first in the 60's. They are received in trance - not directly - as they are part of the preparation needed to reach that point where Direct Voice can be achieved. 

The messages we received have been published in four volumes as of 2020. Another volume exists of messages received much earlier (1958 to 1970) by Alec Gaunt's group in Vancouver. The earlier messages were published as "Volume One" of this, currently, five volume set. Those older messages are not available on this web site at the moment except in a pdf.
