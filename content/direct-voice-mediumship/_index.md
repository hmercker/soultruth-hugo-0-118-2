# Direct Voice Mediumship


One of the most challenging but fascinating aspect of our ventures in mediumship has been an invitation by our guides to sit in circle for the development of what we call Direct voice or D.V. We began in the fall of 2017 and continue to pursue it to this day. For a more detailed explantion of what Direct Voice is, why we are so excited by it, and how it came about, this piece was written by Geoff for the Introduction of Volume 2 of the Direct Voice messages.

## Background to the D.V. Project

I first met Al Fike in 2012. I can’t recall when I first heard about the activities of one of his mentors – Alec Gaunt. However I did hear that Alec was extremely keen to develop "Direct Voice" mediumship, and that such a project was unsuccessful in the late 1960’s and was one of the many activities that he undertook and probably led to his premature death. He had devoted an enormous amount of energy to that project, as well as others and he was literally burning the candle at both ends. Anyway, sadly with his death, that project came to a sudden end. Seretta Kem commented on May 18th 2018 as follows:

>Our beloved friend Alec was very eager to have this gift come forth. He indeed was dedicated and expended much energy towards these efforts and came close to the realization of this desire to bring direct voice to the world. But there was one flaw; his physical was not strong enough to withstand the intensity of this development regime. As he continued to focus on other projects as well, putting upon him great expectations and pressures, which led for his heart to fail.

As someone who has studied not only the theory of mediumship of all kinds, but has also studied the output of many mediums, I accept that mediumship is more art than science. But I recently discovered that James Padgett heard from his wife regarding Direct Voice:

> Well in my home I am so very much engaged in studying the laws of communicating with you that I have hardly time for anything else. I am now quite certain that I understand how to talk to you in an independent voice and also to materialize. So you must not be astonished anytime to hear my voice or see me in the form of a materialized spirit.<sup>1</sup>

Whether a particular channeled message is highly accurate, accurate, or poor will vary by medium, and by day. It’s impossible and indeed not smart to categorize a style of mediumship as being inherently better than another style, and it’s also very silly to categorize all the work of a medium into one bucket. We are all aware that mediumship requires the communication to go through the brain of the medium. And therein lies one of the limitations. If a medium has a brain that has not been trained in a subject, say medicine, or psychology, that medium will not have the ability to communicate complex messages on those subjects even though the spirit may be an expert. What is worse however is that if the medium has a strong opinion, that opinion may seriously distort what is received, even to the extent of aligning it with the medium’s point of view, as opposed to what the spirit is trying to communicate. So I could see some benefit in attempting to obtain a "clear channel" using a process whereby the spirit creates a materialized voice box and speaks without using the brain of the medium. But this was not to my point of view something that would change the world. And my indifference to this project continued for some time.

However at some stage I was shared additional material. Direct Voice was not just about getting a pure channel. *It was about materializing spirit in the daylight, such that observers could see and listen directly to the spirit.* This was an astounding bit of information, and I immediately could see this could change the world – literally. I was aware that spirits have been materialized for a great many years by material mediums. But this happens in almost complete darkness, using ectoplasm, and light cannot be allowed to intrude, or the medium will be severely injured, and could be killed. The other point is that these dark séances are not conducive to getting people to believe that things are as they appear. They are still extremely suspicious, and the dark room does not help to remove that suspicion.

Sometime early in 2017 this additional information came my way, and as I say I then became very supportive of this curiously named D.V. project. I find it hard to believe that I was the last man on board, but it should be admitted that things moved very fast once I was committed. Al now started to receive the communications that are listed on these pages.

Eventually a group of seven was ‟selected" because spirit were involved in this process. Apparently it needed a very specific mix of persons, as well as only people who would be very harmonious. That said, we had to work hard on the harmony!

Our first retreat as a group was from Monday 23<sup>rd</sup> October till Sunday December 17<sup>th</sup> 2017 – two months largely in isolation, and we were praying close to three hours a day! Eventually this group of seven was given the name "The Water Carriers" by Mary the mother of Jesus. That’s a pretty awesome name considering Jesus was the first water carrier! Our second "refresher" isolation retreat was a week in Hawaii in March 2018.

Although obviously we initially started with one group of seven, this has now been extended and there are three groups at the moment. 

# First DV Project

The communications received and some background on this group is [linked here.](/direct-voice-mediumship/dv_group_1)


# Second DV Project
A group of three individuals living in Australia asked the angels in mid 2020 if they could start a DV group. One member was also part of the First DV Group. This was enthusiastically accepted by the angels and is on-going to this time. A fourth member of the group has been accepted who does not live physically in Australia but who is very well known to the other three. This aspect ensures the maintenance of excellent harmony, as they are all close. The group has decided not to release any communications as of this date.

# Third DV Project
In mid 2021 a third group of individuals predominantly in Canada and North America have formed a DV group and is led by Al and Jeanne Fike. They are releasing their messages which can be found [on the link.](/direct-voice-mediumship/volume_3_1)
