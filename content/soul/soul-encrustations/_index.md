# Expiation and Soul Encrustations

A not well understood area of soul transformation  through receiving Divine love is soul expiation. Simply stated, it is the process by which the impurities surrounding the soul are released. It is often, but not always, a painful experience that usually comes unbidden in prayer and every day thought. The messages contained in this section help the us to understand why and how soul expiation is necessary and important. Expiation is a gift and an important component of soul growth. The silver lining of this process is that one becomes free of unwanted baggage and internal emotional pain, never having to revisit it again. This section gives both reassurance and understanding of the importance of the process of soul awakening and cleansing.
