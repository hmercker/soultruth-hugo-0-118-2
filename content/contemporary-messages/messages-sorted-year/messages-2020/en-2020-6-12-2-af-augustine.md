Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Augustine, your teacher. The winds of change have brought you together, have they not? You have been drawn together that you may pitch your tents against the storms of life and draw upon one another for support and love and that you may indeed contribute your light into this beautiful group and family of souls seeking truth and seeking the gift of God’s Love to awaken and touch your soul.

You have found great solace, peace, truth, and understanding together. You have done so with an open heart and an eagerness to learn and to understand your own journey to God. So all that is required, all that can be given has been laid at your feet that you may indeed bring into yourself those truths and aspects of experience and understanding that will assist you upon your journey.

Though each of you walks to God alone, you are together upon this path. Provided you commit yourselves in service and love to support one another, you will be able to rely upon these bonds of love to assist you upon your journey and you will be able to rely upon us in the Celestial Kingdom to also assist you and to be close.

The workings of God are not particularly complicated. You may all understand these things without too much contemplation and dissection. For this Truth rests within your souls. You have come to appreciate and open these things within you. As you do so, know that God will provide every way and means to truly come to know the workings of your soul, the workings of God, and the workings of Truth. These things are promised to you, beloved souls, because you have set your foot upon this Divine Path towards God. You have opened your souls to His gift of Love. You have trusted and you have encouraged one another upon this path. See for yourselves, beloveds, how God continues to uphold you, to encourage you, to guide you.

So much still awaits but you have had an experience together of God’s blessings and abundance to bring you further into the Light and Truth of His Love. Contemplate the words that have been shared, the visions and the experiences. Make within yourself a place where you may cherish these things that they may grow and expand within your soul and become another segment in the foundation in your journey towards Truth.

More is to come. We will insure that you will continue in your education. May you decide and commit yourself towards this journey of Truth. Together we will walk upon God’s Path Divine, blessed by His Holy Spirit, blessed by the Truth that is all that He has created and exists in the Universe, blessed by your friends, the Angels of the Celestial Kingdom, blessed by one another as you continue to support one another in love. What more may you ask of, beloved souls, than the workings of Love manifest within your lives, given freely, abundantly, and beautifully?

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine. I continue to walk with you all. God bless you. God bless you indeed. Thank you.
