# What will be your Gift to God?

September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am your sister and friend and a disciple of the Master, I am Care. In the material world it is often challenging to activate your will and let it be at one with God, in harmony with His laws, and most especially, open to receiving His Love. The entertainments of the world that you live in are numerous and many faceted, some like sparkling jewels, glistening and grabbing your attention. Others like deep dark holes inviting you in, and appealing to those things that are not of the highest, with base desires, revenge, or violence. The others I speak of as being more positive amusements.

When you explore, we open your heart, and you become a co-creator with God, with the angels and are able to use your gifts and you all have gifts, to bring these gifts to the world that it may be lifted up. I wish to encourage you to activate your will, to start your day in prayer, asking for God and the celestial angels to touch your souls, to guide you, to open your hearts, and to allow your gifts to heal this world, to shine a light in the darkness, to give strength to those who are battling their addictions, hurting from their wounds. 

What a blessed circle this is. What a privilege that you come together seeking the highest, asking God to open your souls to the great inflowing of His Love. This is Godâ€™s gift to you. What will be your gift to God? I join you now in the peace of this gift of Love with all my love and blessings in the Grace of God. Thank you. I am Care.
