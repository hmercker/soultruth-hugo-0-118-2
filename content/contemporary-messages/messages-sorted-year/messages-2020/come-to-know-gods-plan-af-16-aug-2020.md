Beloved Father, may the power of your Love touch the souls of all who come to this Circle of Light. I am Elijah, prophet of old, who comes to assure you, all of you beloved souls upon this world, that God indeed has a plan for the salvation of humanity, for it is a law that all things come to harmony and light in Godâ€™s Universe. So God will guide all his children to Light. The time has come in your world as the darkness escalates and the conditions of your world continue to draw it and all within it away from the Light.

So an intervention must come to bring and restore harmony to all upon this world, all creatures, all souls, all elements of the world must come back into balance. So this plan continues to be enacted. It may not seem obvious to you but I tell you that each of you, provided your willingness is to be in alignment with God, in alignment with all that is in harmony with God's Creation, in alignment with love, you will come to know this plan as a very real part of your life, motivating your actions, motivating your instrumentality and your gifts. 

All that you may do to bring greater light to this world may have a far greater effect when you are in alignment with God in a conscious way. You each seek to know yourselves, to know God, to know Creation and to know Truth. So many in your world seek these things through their minds and stop at this juncture of experience and understanding. Yet beyond the mind is the soul that carries its own consciousness, its own mind. This is where you must go, to that place beyond the mind, the material, to a place far deeper and more fulfilling, a place that may see and know God in all God's beauty and Love. 

Your souls long for this. So often your souls are ignored and are not given the channel or opportunity to come to your conscious self and be an active player in your journey of awakening. This may be remedied by the gift of receiving Divine Love, the Essence of God. In this gift from God, which must come through your prayers and your asking to receive it, so much will flow. You will come to know the special qualities, the uniqueness, that sense and feeling of its Presence within you. It is a great gift, one beyond your imaginings. Its effects are utterly transformative and bring to you deep knowledge, wisdom, joy and Truth. This Love awakens. So I pray for all of you who seek to change the world and bring greater light and understanding to it. I pray for you all as do many angels and many bright spirits who surround you and wish to assist you and assist God in the awakening of humanity.

Come to know God's plan. Come to know God's plan for your souls and you will be enlightened, beloved and beautiful precious children of God. Know that as you pray and draw in this gift of Divine Love, that we too will come and be with you in prayer and uplift you in prayer, for this is also a law, that like will attract like, that in this intention to receive this gift of Love, that soulful desire, so you draw the angels of love to your side and so you draw the blessings of God given to you through the Holy Spirit into your soul. 

Together we commune in this Light, precious and beloveds. Together we are all children of God. Together we will overcome the darkness and assist God in awakening your brothers and sisters to Light. This is the next step in the evolution of humanity, to come to understand these deeper aspects of their creation and to express them in the world.
 
The turning point is here. The choice for love is abundantly clear. Seek this Love. Seek to be Love. Seek to be in the Light that Love brings. Seek to know your own soul and that which created your soul and all will flow in abundant light and joy, awakening to Truth, sloughing off the illusions of your world, those illusions created by man and not of God. So, the clarity of Truth will show the way for humanity. 

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Elijah. I am with you in your efforts. Many are with you and seek to uplift you into greater Truth and Love. God bless you. Each and every precious soul, I bring a blessing to you. Open your hearts and know that you are loved. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
