I add my prayers to your prayers, beloved souls, I am Confucius. I add my love to your love and your concerns for your brothers and sisters and for this world. Indeed we in the Celestial Kingdom do pray for these things, for all who are in need, for all who are in darkness, all who are alone and afraid and unable to find their way out of darkness. The many millions in your world who suffer in a myriad of ways; the many lost souls who within their hearts are heavy and dark and yet continue to seek distraction, to run away from these feelings of despair; the many who are misguided, the many who continue to stubbornly adhere to a mindful condition that does not love readily nor acknowledge love from others. 

And we pray for all of you who pray for the healing of your world and yet, you are all caught in a dilemma as you go about your daily life and by no fault of your own, you continue to contribute to the undoing of your world, your physical world, by your actions. This we do not condemn you for, beloved souls, for this great dilemma is beyond your capacity to heal. Though you may do certain things that will help and assist the world to heal and you are doing so at this very moment in prayer, the very nature of your lives, your cultures, your world in the material sense, continues to tear down the harmony of a world created by God. 

So many changes will come. So many healings will be bestowed upon you and your world and many upon it. God indeed has a plan to resolve these issues and these dilemmas, and I urge you to ask each day: “Beautiful and beloved God, may you guide me so that I might be part of your plan for the salvation of humanity and the salvation of your world“. And indeed God will guide you in some small way. 

God will give you vision and depth of understanding, so that you may see the need for change, the need to unravel this great Gordian knot of misdeeds and error and lack of love. So much will come as a result of prayer in your efforts to be with God. So much will be resolved through the changing conditions of your world. When it seems that all is coming to a head and the misery and the difficulties and the complexities of the dilemmas that you face are great, know that often it is this escalation of conditions that must come before they are cleared and healed so that God will indeed wipe away the root causes, giving you all a new lease on life, as you would say. 

You must have faith in this and you must listen, listen beloved souls. Listen to God’s sweet and loving words to each one of you. Listen to the wisdom of your souls. Go beyond the worries and machinations of your minds and make every effort to walk in the harmony and truth of God's Will and Love. In this way you truly contribute to the healing of your world, especially the world around you and those souls around you and the soul inside of you. 

May you carry the torch of love wherever you go. May you have the strength that is your faith, that God will indeed heal and guide and love and nurture and bring peace your world, which is the destiny of your world, to be at peace and all within, to be in harmony and know peace.

I bring to you my blessings, beloveds, peace to your souls and minds, joy to your hearts, relief from your pains, Light to your soul. God bless you, I am Confucius. I love you all, beautiful, beautiful souls. My little birds, sing your songs to God and God will have you within the palm of His hands and carry you into great Light. God bless you. Confucius loves you.
