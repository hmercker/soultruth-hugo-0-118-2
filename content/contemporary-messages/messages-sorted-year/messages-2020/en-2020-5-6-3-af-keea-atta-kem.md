Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Keea Atta Kem. My dear beloved children, teachers, channels of Love, beautiful souls for God, it pleases us greatly to see how you continue to work together to seek to serve God in many different ways. I tell you, my friends, that no time is wasted, no effort is without merit. Each time you put yourselves forward to teach, to heal, to bless, to utilise your gifts in the name of Truth, God is blessing each moment, each breath that you take and each time you are in service.

As you can see, as one door has closed, another has opened. So it will be in your lives. God will utilise every opportunity, every situation to His advantage to bring His children to Light, to Truth, to Love. So you must be within that flow of His Love and Will, realising when you are open and flexible and desire to do the Will of God that many opportunities will open to you, many of which are unanticipated and surprising. But I tell you my friends, all is within the flow and Will of God. All is within His plan to bring greater light to your world. You are allowing God to utilise you in these ways and means to communicate with your brothers and sisters, to inspire and bring forward understanding  hope and enthusiasm for the awakening of the souls of those who are drawn to you.

You are leaders,  leaders in your own right, leaders that are uplifted and fed by the Great Soul of God. So each time you step forward in this way leading others to greater light, know that you too are growing and expanding in the Truth.  But as you teach, so you will learn and develop your gifts. As you step forward, so that channel of light that is you in relationship with God strengthens and grows, it becomes more powerful.

Each experience, each time you come together in this way or you do so singly, you are opening this great Portal of Light and Truth and Love for your brothers and sisters. Your life is purposeful, such a deep blessing and reward for your efforts to continue to walk upon this Divine Path. Many, many experiences are coming. Many doors will indeed open. Many individuals will come close seeking Truth, seeking to be inspired and directed.

As you place foremost your channel of love for all that you meet, in acceptance and with your caring spirit, and your desire to uplift your brothers and sisters, to heal them, to teach them the simple Truth of Godâ€™s Love, so you will bring to yourselves great blessings, great upliftment. Your lives will be a dedication of love, a true dedication to God in loving thanks and gratitude for what God has given to you, what God has created within you, and what can and will be manifest through you.

May God bless you my beloved, beloved friends upon this Path Divine, seekers of Truth, teachers of Truth, beautiful channels of Light. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem. My love is with you. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
