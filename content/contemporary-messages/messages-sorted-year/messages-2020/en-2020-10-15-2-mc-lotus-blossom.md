# God Answers Jesus' Prayer

October 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Healing Collection, Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

Dear friends it is Lotus Blossom. The Master’s prayer for you has been answered by God in a way where there has been a special blessing and deep inflowing of the Essence of God into each of your souls. It is a blessing like we have not seen before. We are joyed in the celestial heavens our brother Jesus has stepped forward bringing forth his own blessing to each one of you and his gift of prayer. An ability to commune with God like no other can. His soulful yearning has ignited a special blessing for each one of you.

For those of you who will not be joining in the session that follows, my gifts and my love are for you and you may call upon me at any time. We shall continue to watch over you and work with you for the development of your healing gift.

When I step forward once again, calling you into another circle where we can work upon the development of your healing gift, may the blessing of your soul be heard and its call honoured and you come together once again.

May God’s Love continue to inflow into each one of you and may your souls awaken deeply and your healing gift touch many.

God bless you dear ones, I am Lotus Blossom.
