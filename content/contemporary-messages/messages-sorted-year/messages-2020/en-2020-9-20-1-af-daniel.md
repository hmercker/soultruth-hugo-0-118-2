Daniel received by Al Fike

Beloved children, may the breath of God's Love blow and enter into your souls. I am Daniel of the Bible. There are many, many angels with you today, angels who come to support you in your prayers and to be with God. Angels that come in hopes that you will be an open channel, an instrument for God so that they may work and bring many blessings to others. Angels who seek for the betterment and welfare of your world, that your world may be enwrapped in love and joy, peace and healing, upliftment and light, for your world, as you well know, is in great need.

So few know how to reach God. So few know the true desires of their souls. So many are lost, absorbed in their own thoughts and worries and cares and absorbed by all the distractions of your world. Distractions that have been manufactured by the human condition, the imaginations of men, the desire of many who wish to pull humanity away from their true selves into a condition of darkness or semi-darkness which is out of alignment with God.

We beseech you, beloved and beautiful souls, to pray for your brothers and sisters. Pray that the conditions of your world may be dissipated by God's Touch and ministrations upon each soul who inhabits this place of yours. As your prayers intensify, as your efforts to bring change are clear and powerful, so God uses you as His instruments. God desires that each one of you come into greater alignment with Him, to know that deep peace and love and joy that comes as God touches your soul and your soul awakens your mind, your consciousness into the reality of God.

He lights a flame within each of you, a flame for you to carry into the world, a flame that may indeed ignite others into desire and action and prayer to bring greater light to your world. See yourselves as activators of light. Acknowledge the light within you. Acknowledge that you may be a powerful channel of God's Love, His Will, His blessings upon this world. For those who have established a deep faith and a deep understanding of the flow of God’s Will igniting a spiritual awareness, a feeling, an inspiration to walk forward in light and be in light expressing all the beauty of your souls, being in harmony with all of God's Laws, God's Laws of Love so you may go forth in the world and enact God’s Will through you.

This is the highest calling, beloved souls, the highest calling. With this calling will come the deepest blessings for each of you. Have faith in yourselves. Have faith that you are full of potential, full of gifts, full of light, just waiting to be initialised and expressed in your lives. Each day will be an adventure. Each day will bring blessings, deep insights, opportunities to serve, and more of God's Love pouring into your souls.

Allow this to be. Put aside those things that distract you from this. Walk in the pure Light of God's Touch and guidance. Be freed from the distractions of your world, the conditions of your world, and walk in this higher plane of consciousness, of understanding, of joy, and of service where love is the currency in your lives. Love is the true expression of your soul, and love is the expression of your mind as well. Those things that are of the natural love and those that are at the Divine Love may be integrated and walk together in harmony each enhancing the other, each part of you in harmony with the other. Where all in time will be integrated and be as one as you walk in this world and in the world of spirit. A magnificent journey, a journey filled with wonder, with new beginnings and the endings of things of the past, of conditions that are not of God falling away, falling away into the bliss of at-onement with God and in harmony with all.

May God bless you on this journey, keeping you close, keeping you all within the light and umbrella of God’s caring and blessings for you. God bless you. I am Daniel and I am happy to speak today to you all. My love is with you. The love of many angels are with you at this moment. The love of God showers upon you. May you absorb these blessings readily and eagerly .God bless you. God bless you all.
