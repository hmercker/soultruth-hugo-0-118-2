# Pray to Learn Why Are You in Existence

April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020

West Vancouver Prayer Circle, West Vancouver, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Blessed children, I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I have come to bless your efforts in seeking the Father's Love, in seeking to enlighten yourself with this gift that is Godâ€™s Essence given to all those who wish to receive it and are open to this blessing. I come to assure you, beloved souls, that though there are great changes in the world, there are also many blessings coming and blessings that are now pouring upon this world;  that it is of light and all that is of goodness and of God will be added to and that which is not of light will be removed from this world in time. You will not be forsaken, beloved souls. Rest assured that God has you in His grasp and that there are many blessings and awakenings, gifts and openings of light that are coming to each of you, provided you spend some time in prayer seeking these gifts from God.

Now that for many of you life has become less hectic and distracting, may you spend more time in prayer, seeking God out in your daily existence. For, as you continue to seek all that is of light and truth, so you will be blessed. At this time, the blessings are great. At this time, much attention is being given to your Earth and many bright spirits and Celestial angels are applying themselves for your benefit and bringing their gifts forward to assist you upon this journey of cleansing and transformation.

Be with God, beloved souls, and all else will follow, all else will be given. You will be guided and protected. You will be shown the way towards light. A great peace will descend upon you, beloved souls, as it will in time for the entire world, a palpable peace and sense of joy. For now is the time when God seeks to communicate with men, to be known to all. So you will come to know your Heavenly Father.

Each of you, all within this world, will be given the opportunity to know God and to truly understand who they are and why they are in existence. Many blessings are coming, great blessings. May you be ready and open, may you come to know your own soul, befriending your soul as you must so to know God.

God bless you, beloved souls. Continue to pray for this gift of Love to pour into you. For this will give you the capacity to know God and to know Truth and to discern what is of Light and what is not. God bless you, beloveds. I am Jesus and I walk with you. I walk with all the children who seek Light. I am with you. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
