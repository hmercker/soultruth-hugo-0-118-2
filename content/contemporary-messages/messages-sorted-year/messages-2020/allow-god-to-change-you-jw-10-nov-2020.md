I am here Yogananda your brother in God’s Love. I come to this beautiful circle of light in this time of change that is upon the earth. I come to say everything in God’s universe is alive and in flux. The universe is progressive. 

You are all here because you wish to be changed into the very substance of your Creator. In the material world there is change and as in the material in spirit there is acceptance and trust and faith, and there is also resistance. The greater the resistance the more friction or heat is created. On the material plane this can result in inharmony that can lead to very negative circumstances such as war, violence and so forth. 

In the spiritual world there is as you say, expiation the letting go, forgiving and forgetting, allowing God to touch your heart, to change your soul. And when there is resistance you feel the heat. Sometimes this is manifested in anger or disbelief, negativity skepticism, or feeling unworthy. This is why prayer for God’s Love is so important and why we love coming to your circles of light and being in prayer with you. 

As you step out of the world and into the light and on to the bridge to the Celestial Heavens as your souls awaken and you allow the change of the essence of the Creator to be yours in very substance, a real part of your being. If you wish to change others, allow yourself to be transformed for they will feel the change in you. And as you bring them truth and your presence and allow God to speak through you, work through you, you can change the world. You can touch many, for this is soul to soul, above the mind, and in the Grace of God. These changes that you requested are yours. This world will be blessed as you are blessed. 
 
As we have said many times, do not fret about the past or worry about tomorrow, but be in the present. Be in His Presence! Bring that to each moment as you serve the world with love. As my brother Gandhi said: “Be the change you wish to see in the world.” Isn’t that beautiful? 

May God bless you with His love Divine. I am your brother and friend. I am Yogananda.
