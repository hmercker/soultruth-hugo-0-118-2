I am your brother Francis. I am drawn to your prayers, drawn to the longings in your souls, I come to bless you and to be with you in the Father’s Love.  When my life became simple everything was discovered in Grace to my soul and to my brothers and sisters who followed the simple path of prayer. But let it be known that we were a most joyous group. We sang and played and enjoyed God’s creation - the flowers and the beauty and the animals and the countryside. Yes we were on the natural path and we were also on the path of God’s Love.  

The world was not without its troubles but we were examples to others of the harmony between the natural and the Divine. I know that I am very known for the animals and my relationship with them and much of that is true. For as I felt God’s love in my soul the animals were not afraid. They are very sensitive, they can feel your intentions and so they were drawn.
I say be not troubled by where you are on your journey or what your gifts are but go to God in prayer and as your receive the glorious gift of His love discernment will be yours for you are on this path of God’s love and He will light the way for each one of you when you allow it. 

You are in a wonderful bubble of protection and when you call we come with all the love in our souls and with our intentions to be a blessing to each one of you. As God blesses each one of you for your asking we come to be at one with you in His love. Be not afraid, have no fear, walk in faith, trust in God and you will join us in the Celestial realms. Have no doubt it will be so. 

May God continue to bless each one of you with the glorious gift of His love. I am your brother and friend in Christ,  I am Francis and I love you.
