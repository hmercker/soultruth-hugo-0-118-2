# This Benediction of the Father’s Love

July 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020 <sup>1</sup>

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am Bernadette and and I come in the Grace of God to this circle of light and love, to this Holy Sacrament, this Benediction of our Heavenly Father’s Love. This communion of souls which has drawn so many you cannot imagine. The place where I lived became a healing sanctuary and to this day it continues to be so. The place where I prayed and Mary came to me. The healing waters there, the miracles there, are well known. The healing waters in this circle are the living waters of God’s Love and Grace. 

We come to be in this prayer with you that all may be healed in the Grace of God. I am your sister and friend in Divine Love. I am Bernadette. God bless you. May His grace be with you.


**Note 1** One of Bernadette’s visitations occurred on July 16th.
