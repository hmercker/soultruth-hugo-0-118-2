# Walk this world in the love of God

I am here Yogananda. I come in God’s love and I wish to say just a few things to this beautiful circle of light. The gifts that each soul may receive become a blessing to the world when they are in love. And the great gift of the Creator’s love raises these gifts up, raises the world up. This circle and the greater circle of this beautiful community has so much support. Our hearts are with you and more importantly, the love in our souls. 

The dear brother who mentioned the Master (GB) and his opening his arms in the gift of love beyond words this indeed is what each one can share. When you walk in Grace and in God’s love words are often not necessary, but should you speak them please know that they contain the intention and the presence of your souls. You need not convince anyone that you love them when they feel your love. 

So as you walk through this world with love, the love of God in your souls you touch many, you bless many and you bring a healing presence. May you continue each to know from the very depths of your souls and with all your heart that God loves you. We will never abandon you should you call we shall come. And as the dear brother said: *“he felt no fear”* (TA) so walk forth in love and those who are fearful you will bring peace to them. 

May the peace that passes understanding be with each. May the glory of His love be yours. With all my love and blessings I am your brother in Christ. I am Yogananda.
