Seretta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

Thank you for bringing light into this dear soul.

As to the conversation that you have had regarding discerning what deems a celestial message, it would be fair to say that this is not something that we have not given you guidance on before for a celestial message will be filled with love, will be filled with guidance toward God, guidance toward building a foundational experience between your soul and the Soul of God and that loving union to grow and expand.

In a celestial message, you will hear of the path of receiving Divine Love upon your soul. You will hear guidance and experiences that we your Celestial Angels, who have walked along this path a little further than you, will share and encourage you to always turn to God, to let the Light of God’s Love envelop your soul, to bring forth the workings of your material mind into harmony with that of your soul mind.

The celestial message can teach, teach about the faculties of the soul, teach about the expansion of the soul, teach about the releasing of the soul conditions that Divine Love has upon every soul. A celestial message will teach about the Laws, Spiritual Laws, the Laws of Creation, even the Laws of Nature.

A celestial message will encapsulate much. A celestial message will feel uplifting, will bring forth light, comfort, joy. We will acknowledge your pain. We will guide you into always reaching to God. So a celestial message can have many components. What is important is the discernment within your soul, each one individually in how this message may touch, may teach, and may help the individual. We are always guiding you towards God and God’s Love. We are always guiding you into your soul for a soul will express light, one where love is what is expressed through you, through your actions, through your thoughts, your words and deeds.

A celestial message is all these things. It is not necessary that each message has all of these components but that a message has some component of that which has been mentioned. We will always speak about Divine Love. We always speak about the importance of your own relationship between your soul to God’s Soul for God is Love. You so desire to behold love in every part of your being. So a celestial message answers the call of your soul that longs to know this Love of God, the understandings and the workings of God, to understand the workings of your own individual soul, its gifts, the qualities and the attributes that are bestowed within your soul. So, my dear friends, a celestial message will administer to your ever growing and expanding soul in the Grace of God’s Love.

I am Seretta Kem. I thank you for your question and I hope that I have given sufficient guidance upon the elements and the components of a celestial message and discerning such. God bless you along your path and journey to God for it is mighty, it is vast, and it is never-ending. God bless you.
