# A Bridge between Heaven and Earth

April 25<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your brother and friend Francis. You are a most gentle group and you have touched my heart. I left the busy-ness of the town to be in nature with my friends, to feel the beauty of God’s creation and to be in harmony with it. We had a balance our little band of the natural love of God’s creation and the Glory of God’s love received in prayer. It was as you can imagine at times a kind of heaven on earth. 

And some were quite astounded that a group of seemingly poor beggars could be so rich in the gifts of the spirit as we called it. And yes the sun of your galaxy and the Master, the first true son of God to receive the love therein is an analogy so you can see the harmony between the two worlds. Your prayers and the longings that you have create a bridge between heaven and earth. 

As it has been the deep desire of so many for a more sustainable earth it is also the desire of so many to make a connection to the spirit world, to the love of God, to the Celestial realm. It is not a battle between these two worlds but a harmony. As you pray you may feel the touch of God’s love and a oneness with the natural world and a Oneness with the very Source and Creator of that world. This is my wish for you as I travel with you on your journey and visit. 

Please know when you ask help is always available. We are here for you more than you know. May each one in this beautiful circle open to and receive the love of God in great abundance. I am your brother and friend of your soul. God bless you. I am Francis. Go in Peace.
