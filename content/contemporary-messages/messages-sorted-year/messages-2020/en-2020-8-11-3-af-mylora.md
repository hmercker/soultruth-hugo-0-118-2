Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

This is Mylora. I bring a freshness to your minds and your bodies, uplifting you and bringing a healing for all of you, beloved souls. Know that there many in the Celestial World, Kingdom that have gifts and are eager to uplift you and bless you with these gifts as we are God’s channels of love and light, blessings to many. Ask for me when you need to be uplifted, when you need to have a sense of energy in your bodies and a sense of well-being in your minds and I will come and bless you, my beloved friends.

May God bless you on your journey toward at-onement with Him. May we all walk upon this journey together. You are my brothers and sisters upon this path and I reach to each one of you to help you as you walk forward for we are all meant to support and love one another upon this journey of love and soul awakening. Know that many who are unknown to you, support you. Their prayers go to the Heavenly Father for your upliftment, your well-being, protection and guidance. Many things come because you have attuned yourselves to the Angels of Heaven who are eager to do God’s bidding and to assist you all upon this journey of light.

God bless you. I am Mylora. I love you. I am with you. Think of the greenness of my light. Think of the greenness in my eyes. Think of the beautiful blessing of this emerald colour that I bring to you all to uplift you and bathe you in this light and condition to refresh you and to bring you to peace. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you indeed.
