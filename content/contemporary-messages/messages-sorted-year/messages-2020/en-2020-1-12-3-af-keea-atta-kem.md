Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

I wish to thank you all for your service to God, for your dedication to this Truth of God's Love for each time you make a prayer to God and seek to receive His blessed Love, you brighten your own soul and thereby brighten the world. May you continue in your efforts, my friends, and take heed of all the guidance and inspiration and blessings that you receive in your day. Take heed of God's Will. Continue to gather as you have and support one another in love and prayer.

We will continue in our efforts to unite you, to bless you, to help inspire you. As God's angels, instruments of light, we are there to assist you upon your journeys and to prepare you for the instrumentalities that God has planned for each one of you. Listen with the ears of your souls. Understand from that deep place within you. Know that you are being guided, that you will continue to grow in Love, that we will continue to assist you and be an integral part a God's plan for the salvation of humanity and the healing of this world and all worlds in Love.

God bless you and we thank you. We are with you. Our love is with you. God's Love infuses us all in this great lights and understanding. I am Keea. God bless you and good day. God bless you.
