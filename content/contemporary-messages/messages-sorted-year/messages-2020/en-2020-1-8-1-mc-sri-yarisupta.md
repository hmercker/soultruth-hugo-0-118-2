# The Soul of God Delivers Guidance to the Essence of Your Soul

General Collection, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Sri Yarisupta received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you. It is Sri Yarisupta. I have not spoken through this instrument before and I am pleased to make a connection, a soul rapport with this instrument. For I wish to bring through a message speaking about guidance and the path of walking with God. When one receives their guidance, it is through the essence of their soul that the Soul of God delivers this guidance. Often the experience that this dear instrument receives is sensations within the body, the entire being and willingness and a right feeling, the mind in harmony without question and a desire to act and fulfill the task.

When one receives guidance, it is not an act of the mind. It is an act through the soul. As one, once soul is developed within the Grace of Divine Love clearing conditions, patterns, and habits, it makes it easier for God to commune more clearly with the soul. This dear gift is for every soul on Earth and in spirit for it is the link that God communes. Once guidance is received, there then comes the influence of this initiative from the soul that bubbles up into the mind depending on the clarity of one’s mind and the willingness of this part of the human to serve the soul, actions may take place.

What the human then is potentially faced with is the actions and the thinking that may test the guidance or the thinking and the actions that solely trust the guidance and know that all will fall into place, that because this guidance has been received within the soul and has been from God, all will manifest well. When the human mind tests the guidance and perhaps struggles, puts too much thinking toward it and wondering how things will come to be, these dear friends, these actions, this thinking serves what in the Eastern philosophies is called the “Wheel of Karma” where things of the material are solely considered or more greatly considered than that of the soul, the wisdom of the soul. So one is testing. This “Wheel of Karma”, this wheel of testing, is evident throughout all areas of your life. For you wish to be aligned with the soul. Yet your actions and your thinking and your patternings serve the carnal appetites and the material experience.

It is a very powerful draw within you that requires your discipline to release these, to let go, and to move into trust and faith. When one is living through trust and faith, this then is serving the “Dharmic Wheel” which is in service of your purpose and is connected to God and it is informed by your soul. Your actions and thinking are informed by your soul.

This certainly takes great discipline, commitment, and clarity of how you wish to live your life. For when you commit and dedicate your actions to serving your Dharma, your purpose, there is trust and there is faith. It is not to say that thinking doubtful thoughts, with being unsure, will not creep into you. It is a matter of not feeding those thoughts and a matter of translating those thoughts into the knowing that you are growing, the knowing that you have received the guidance through the wisdom of your soul and the Truth of God to your soul.

In all moments, one is either feeding, choosing to live, Karma, or Dharma. As you, beloved souls, continue to pray for Divine Love, serving your purpose, your Dharma, is easier to fulfill. There comes a great desire within you to continue to put your focus, your attention, your actions, and your thinking towards God’s Will for you.

This is part of God’s Plan for the Salvation of Mankind. God asks you, *“What is it that you are putting in between yourself and God?”* These are the Karmic actions, thoughts, and deeds. God gives you the wisdom and the Truth and invites you to put God in between you and everything. This, friends, is serving your Dharma and purpose. When God is between and with every action, your thoughts and thinking, all is well. For God leads you into Light, into thoughts and actions of Love.

It is not necessarily that there is only one right action. No, beloveds, there may be numerous answers to any particular situation. But if your actions and thoughts are filled with Light and with Love and with a sense of the greater community being considered, be sure to know that the wisdom and the Truth and the Love of God is in that.

So when you are following your patterns of light and your thoughts of love, your actions and deeds are caring and giving, thoughtful towards yourself and the well-being of others, God is in that. When your actions and your thoughts and your deeds are primarily of greed, lust, conceit, jealousy that lack humility, lack compassion, God is not there. Those components are in between you and God. There has not been any consideration of God in any of this.

But what we do know is God is awaiting your invitation, your draw for help and how to change these ways and how to move into serving your purpose, your Dharma, and releasing the patterns and habits of Karma. One has great distance from God and the other is directly linked with God. One serves the mind and one serves the soul. We understand this struggle that you have in this human form. But I hope that I have been able to share some wisdom through this instrument, this simple language in a way that you may be able to implement more of your Dharmic actions, serving your soul, connecting to God more frequently. It is not something that will change overnight for each have had years of building patterns and habits that solely serve the mind and the physical body.

Now it is time to serve the soul and allow those Truths and wisdom and the guidance that sits within the soul to inform the actions of the body and the thinking of the mind. You are all ready to take this step and foster more greatly your service. For those actions and thinking that you do in private, that you feel and you seem to think that no one is observing you, your soul is observing you. God is observing you.

So we ask that you allow the beauty of the soul to take over, to watch this bud blossom into its full bloom rising up within you and filling and informing your mind. See this glorious blossom rise up from your soul and sit within your mind. As you do this, your soul mind sitting within your material mind, your clarity shall be its given gift and your connection and harmony of the soul mind sitting within the material mind, informing, causing right action and deep service to God, there shall be great elation and joy and deep connection, knowing that the Hand of God has touched you so greatly in your soul that it has awakened this blossom, this beautiful flower, each petal awakened in its gift serving mankind.

My dear friends, you then walk as a more awakened being. You walk in trust and in faith and very little can test you. May God bless you on your journey to awakening. I am happy to serve with this message of Truth to each one of you. I am Sri Yarisupta. God bless you.

My dear friends, you then walk as a more awakened being.
