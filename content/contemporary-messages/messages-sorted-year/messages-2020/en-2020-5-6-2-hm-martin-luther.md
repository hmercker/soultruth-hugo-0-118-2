Martin Luther received by Helge Mercker

My daughter, I am here to write. I greet you at this hour of prayer and communion with our Father, this time of reflection upon spiritual subjects. I am Martin Luther, your teacher and guide. I have come to share my love and to pray with you, to embrace you in this light of God’s Love, feeling ever so close to His Touch.

My daughter, there is so much to know and understand as you continue to travel along your path. To receive God’s Love is the fuel to understanding the direction the soul must take to navigate the different terrains, to stay steady towards its destination. I wish to support you and encourage you whenever you need help. In your work, call upon me and I will help you. Much is given, much is given to the one who desires to work for God and Truth.

I come to bring you my love tonight and wish to express my gratitude for your persistence in the work that you do. In translating the many messages revealing many valuable lessons and teachings. It is important work, though you feel at times that no one is interested, yet you know in your soul the importance of this task. Continue on and I will stand by your side. Continue and feel encouraged my dear daughter. Much is to come.

It is such a pleasure and joy when we see how dear souls commit to our Fathers work of Love. How their souls open up and God’s Love stirs the soul. Expanding the soul in its qualities and potentials, as the person gently, sometimes hesitantly, tries to respond to the soul’s yearning to be expressed. The awakening of the soul brings the beauty of God’s creation to blossom in its pursuit to fulfill its purpose, as God intended His creation to be expressed. It is a transformative process, gently advancing with each prayer, each soul longing for the Father’s precious Gift of Divine Love, infusing the soul with the substance that is divine in its nature and with the quality of life eternal. As this Love is ever expanding within the soul, the transformative action will bring the desired effects reflected in its attributes, its qualities, its expressions. In your world, to be able to express ones soul’s attributes, gifts and qualities depends on truly having let go of restrictions and habits, rules and expectations of the mind or the ego. Once these aspects have been cleared and released, the mind is integrated within the soul’s reflection of love and it is an easier task for the soul to move forward in the world, fulfilling its purpose, its calling to live a soulful life, a life of soul infused with God’s Love.

May the journey continue as you seek God’s Love every day, bringing you the sustenance and water of life, bringing you step by step to an awareness of your true self, where you are willing to release unloving habits and patterns, turning towards the Light, ever seeking His Love. Walk on my daughter and I walk with you. Feel our love as we are here with you now and we continue to pray with you. Be blessed by the Heavenly Father’s Touch and His Love, as it flows ever forth. God bless you. My love is always with you. I will come again soon as there is much I wish to write. God bless you and I love you, I am Martin Luther.
