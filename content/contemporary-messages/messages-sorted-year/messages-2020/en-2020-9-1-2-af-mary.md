Mary received by Al Fike

May God bless you beloved and beautiful children, I am Mary. Where there is love there is hope. Where there is love there is an upliftment. For those who are expressing their love to one another, there is light, there is joy. So, you must carry love wherever you go, my beautiful and beloved children of God. When you gaze upon another, gaze with love. When you encounter one of your brothers and sisters, be there in love, serve in love, put aside all judgments or fears or reluctance, and be love. For, love is what will change your world. Love is what brings hope to all.

Be love, live love, pray that God's Love may continue to enter your soul, accumulating this great and beautiful, soulful Love within you, expressing those attributes of God that are Love, through you. For it is love that will heal the world. It is love that will push back the darkness. It is love that will bring what is needed to change the ways of your world, change those who are in darkness, heal and uplift and bring wisdom to the peoples of this world of yours.

We come for this reason, beloved souls, to bring love. We come to encourage you to be love, to set aside all that is not of love and to awaken and encourage within yourself, whether it be the natural love or the Divine Love, expressed in your world, together, these forces for love will bring great change and healing and peace. Be love, be love and know that you are loved. That Godâ€™s Love for you is so great and powerful that it will transform and change you into a Divine Angel as you continue to tread this road towards at-onement with God. Be love, my beloveds. I love you dearly. God bless you and keep you in His Love. God bless you.
