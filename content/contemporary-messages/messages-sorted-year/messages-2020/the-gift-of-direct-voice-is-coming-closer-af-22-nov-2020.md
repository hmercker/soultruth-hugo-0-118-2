It is Seretta Kem. You are coming closer to the realisation of this gift of material expressions and manifestations in alignment with God’s Love and God’s Will. You will have your opportunities to be instruments in this way as you continue to express and realise the inner potentials of your souls awakening ever so slowly, awakening to truth, awakening to God’s plan, awakening to your own inner knowledge and gifts that are being ignited by the blessing of the Divine Love.

Continue to have faith that you are upon the right road, that you are flourishing in the Light of God’s Love, that those obstructions to the expression of these gifts are slowly disintegrating in the Light of God’s Love burning within your souls and that your minds are coming into greater alignment with the understandings of your soul You are coming to know your true selves, beloved and beautiful souls, your true selves upon this path of service and love. 

I know you have considered what may come with these gifts and you long to be of service in this way and you see that this is the great initiator for things to come in a powerful way to the consciousness of humanity. Indeed it is one instrument that will bring about this realisation but there are many aspects and elements that are coming into alignment, many ventures, many ideas are springing forth within your minds and your souls seeking to be in alignment with God’s Will and plan for humanity. 

So these things continue to bubble forth from your souls into your minds, making these things a tangible truth, an expression of God’s Will and God’s Truth in the world. Continue on in your efforts. Continue on and pray earnestly for the awakening, cleansing of your souls, its transformation in God’s Love so that you will find yourselves at a place of great joy and purity, strength and love.

It is these things that will open up the possibilities of these gifts for yes, they are implanted within each one of you and require further dedication and efforts to bring them forth that they may manifest as they are meant to and that all is done within the flow and harmony that is part of God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. 

We wish for you to be strong, and we wish for you to be wise. We wish for you to be humble and in deep alignment with your soul and with God. With these things growing within you, bringing the transformation and the healing and the alignment that is necessary, you will find your way upon this path opened and designated for each one of you.

Maturity is growing within you and there is in your souls an urgency to fulfill its purpose, to be that bright and shining channel of love, an instrument of God’s Will in the world. It comes day by day, step by step. It comes with your earnest and dedicated prayers. It comes with your guided actions and service to humanity. Much is still meant to be, and will come to be upon this path that you walk upon. These efforts that you are making will ensure the unfoldment of God’s Will. Be in harmony together. Be true to your path. Be true to your soul and come to know God more deeply and fully as you embrace His Love, His Great Soul, in communion and prayer.

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem and I continue to walk with you on this great journey of awakening. My love is with you. Our dedications have not ceased in regards to these efforts. Rather we continue to support your individual journey to greater light and harmony and soul awakening. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
