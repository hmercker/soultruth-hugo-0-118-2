# Stay the Course with Love

March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your friend Eileen. I was with you earlier at the circle and I chose, as I told my dear friend here, to speak to this circle because in a sense I am your guardian on this journey, this project.

On the subject of service I tell you of all the things that my Findhorn became they have always stayed with service and it’s a beautiful requirement as those who stay are required do service and you will of course discover this when you are there if you don’t know it already.  They have formed a large and diverse community focusing on sustainability and the ecosystems, the gardens and all these wonderful things. On the periphery there is a spiritual tone that has never been lost although it does need to be recharged and it is a bit more in words than in practice.  

I am here because you can bring your practice, your prayer life, your souls in transition and the light you carry there, (as i have said before) to recharge Findhorn. Yes there are hoops to jump through as you can see and my friend here is quite flabbergasted by this but since he seeks clarity as you all do, you will find it and the proposal will go ahead and a beautiful one it will be.  If any of you feel you feel are having trouble expressing just call on me I will come and guide you. 

As always I give you my love and blessings and gratitude for this endeavor of your hearts has touched mine. I love you all. May God bless you. I am Eileen.
