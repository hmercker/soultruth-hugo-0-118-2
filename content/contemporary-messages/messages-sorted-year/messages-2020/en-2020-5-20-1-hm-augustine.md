# A Morning Greeting

May 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020

General Collection, Swakopmund, Namibia

Augustine received by Helge Mercker

My daughter, it is a good time to write as you are in a receptive condition and open to receiving my words.

Faithful continuous prayer, in love, of love, and for the Love of God, opens one’s soul to receive the purest and highest blessings. Pray my dear child, as this is the way to a life fulfilled in the everlasting green pastures and streams of purest water, that will nourish and strengthen you.

God has given each soul the potential to seek this nourishment for soul bonding and anchoring in pure love, peace and harmony. These pastures with their joyful colours of flowers reflect the gifts that God presents in your soul, blessed with drops of dew, the drops of God’s Love. Drink deep, soak it all in, and let the flowers of your soul bloom in spectacular, vibrant colours for all to see. Share the love as the soul expands with all its potentials and gifts, enriching the world, bringing God’s Wish closer to fulfillment.

I bring my blessing to you as the new day dawns and you are ready to engage in a prayerful and love filled day. God bless you, I am with you. Augustine loves you.
