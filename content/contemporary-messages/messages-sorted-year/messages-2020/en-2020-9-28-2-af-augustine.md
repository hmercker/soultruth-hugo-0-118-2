In this longing to be with God, you will be open to all of these blessings and see before you a great bounty of blessings and gifts, upliftment and truth. We are with you as well. We are with you in love as we walk upon this path together in God’s Love.

Seek ye the kingdom, beloved souls, and all things shall come. Seek to be in the light and you will be protected in the light. You will feel peace and joy. God’s blessing continue to pour forth. May you absorb and accept all that God has to give. It is never-ending, beloved souls. It is never-ending. Open yourselves to these gifts and you will find all that your souls seek. In this, your minds will be at peace and know truth.
