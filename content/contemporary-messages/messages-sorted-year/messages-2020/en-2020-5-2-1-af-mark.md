Mark received by Al Fike

Bless you, beloved souls, with this great comfort and peace and love. I am Mark and I have come to assure you that your church will remain standing, that those of you who are part of this community will continue to be blessed and that all good things that are of God, blessed by God and in harmony with God’s laws of creation will remain and be strengthened in the times to come. All of those things that are of man and reflect the baser appetites of man must be neutralized and brought into harmony with love.

Your world is changing and though you may indeed feel threatened and uncomfortable with these changes and these conditions that reflect the imbalance in your world, what is coming is a time of true peace, a time where peace will reign supreme in your world and will last for many, many centuries. Is this is not something that you would all desire, a world that has been brought back to a place of harmony and balance, a world in which humanity will be motivated by love, compassion, and wisdom and honours one another with the grace of love?

My beloved souls, I know it is a difficult time but I urge you to seek the blessings of God, the comfort of God’s Presence to pray for what your needs, your true needs, are within you, to seek greater wisdom and love within you, to be in harmony with your soul with your entire being. In in this way, you prepare yourself for that great peace that is coming in your world.  Be strong, beloved souls, and know that we in the Celestial Kingdom will come to be by your side if you beseech our presence and seek the Love of God in your soul. We will come to bring blessings, healings, upliftment and love.

All these things are available to every soul upon your world and may come to every soul upon your world, given that they desire this, that they truly wish to be in this light, the light of God’s Love, the light of God’s Truth, of God’s wisdom. Though each travels a road that is unique to them, have beliefs that are different from one another, within your souls is a unity and sense of connection that goes one to another to another creating a great Lattice of Light, a beautiful Lattice of Light which God will infuse with His blessings and power and Love and bringing to you the nurturance of your soul which will in turn bring to you the awakening of your spiritual understandings and soulful knowings.

There is a plan, beloved souls, that is unfolding that will bring the Earth and all within it into harmony. May you be a part of this plan. May you step forward with a faith, a trust that all will unfold in harmony, that your needs will be met, that humanity will come to the realisation of its own wondrous potentials and possibilities in light, that this overwhelming desire for the material will be transformed into something that is in harmony with what God provides for each soul upon your planet, and that this wisdom will prevail and will prevail because love will become the currency of your world.  Truth will be understood by every soul that opens themselves to Truth, not a truth of their own mindful concoction but a Truth that is of God and given to you in abundance and powerfully so.

May God bless you on that journey, beloved souls. You are on your way to towards a wondrous evolution of the human soul. May you recognize that you begin this journey. May you, with the joy and desire and knowing, put your foot upon this path that God has placed before you. May you come to that place of true acknowledgement, of true beginnings releasing those conditions that are not of Truth, that are not of love, that are not of light, releasing that human condition that has so long shackled humanity and kept it in darkness and suffering. That is the human lot in your world.

Peace is coming, beloved souls. Truth is upon you if you but open your eyes and give to God, a prayerful desire that you may be open and receptive to what God has to give, for God’s generosity and Love is boundless and will bring to you all insights and Truth, knowledge, forbearance, patience, joy. These things are meant to be for each of you.  May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Mark. I am happy to have spoken to you today.  God bless you. God bless you.
