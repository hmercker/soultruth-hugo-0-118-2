I am here, Yogananda, your brother and friend. I see there is a bit of a weight on you all today, as you see so many changes taking place in this world that you live on, this earth. You have been given insight into these earth changes in advance, that you may pray and be in God’s Grace throughout, that you may trust your guidance as to how to react.

There is an inner and an outer world. The earth is a living being, as you are living beings, and the earth responds to repair, as you respond to heal your wounds, your walls and all that you have built or encountered. And you go to God, who brings His Great Love into each soul to remove and dissolve these barriers that separate you. So too, the earth begins to remove and wash away and disrupt the in-harmonies that have been placed upon it. 

It is a consciousness, and so, with your great consciousness of soul awareness, you can look upon these events and be joyful in knowing. As your souls are purified and brought into alignment with the Father’s Love, the earth too is being brought into alignment with its natural harmony, with its origins. Do not despair, but go into your souls. Allow God to open them up so that you may live and walk in Light and Love and in Grace without fear, for you are the Light in this world by the Grace of God. We are with you. Feel this, know it, and have faith. All will be well.

With all my love and blessings and the protection of the Celestial Realm, may God’s Love be upon you and transform your souls.

In His Love, I bid you farewell for now, I am Yogananda.
