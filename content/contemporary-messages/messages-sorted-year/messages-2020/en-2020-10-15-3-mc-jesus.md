# A Blessing and Prayer

October 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Healing Collection, Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Maureen Cardoso

I come, I am Jesus. May the gift of God’s Light and Love pour deeply into your souls. I come to shower a blessing over each one of you who are dedicated to awakening their souls, to serving God, to serving God’s Will and to being a channel of healing  for their brothers and sisters.

*Oh my Heavenly Father hear my prayer for these precious children of Earth who yearn deeply from their souls for their awakening through Your Love. Shower them with a deep inflowing, the grace of Your Love.*

*Help each one to walk closely to you opening them of soul and of mind, where the precious mind may align with the grace and the power of their soul. May this Love that You imbue into their souls awaken and inform their minds and great harmony exist within each one.*

*Father these children of Earth are needed. I pray for a great blessing to come upon each one of them where those of us in the celestial heavens can be close to them through this transformation that is underway upon Earth. This I pray to you gracious Father. Amen*
