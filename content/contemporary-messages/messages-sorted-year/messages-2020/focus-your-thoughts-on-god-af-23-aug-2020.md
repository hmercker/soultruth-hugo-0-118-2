Bless you, beloved souls, I come, I am Jesus. I come to uplift you, to be a part of your prayers, to add to your prayers my own prayers for your well-being and soul awakening in the Father’s Love. I come to tell you that in many ways, we in the Celestial Kingdom work diligently to uplift you and to sustain a light around you. I wish to emphasize that your thoughts and desires play a key role in how effective our efforts are in sustaining light in your lives.

Your prayers, as you know, elicit God's Touch, bringing His Love to knock on the door of your soul that you may open wide and receive this gift. This is a great source of light in your life. But, because of the conditions of the world that swirl about you, the thought conditions of darkness that are so evident in your world, those things that distract you in life that are not in harmony with God, these conditions, the human condition, which you all are immersed within each day, this is where our ministrations help you to rise above the earthly condition into light.

So there are three factors that determine your condition. First and foremost is yourself, your thoughts, your desires, your efforts to be close to God. Secondly are our efforts to help support you. As you draw us close by being in light, sustaining light in your minds and your souls, so we may be of powerful assistance in your search and desire to be in the light. Thirdly, God responds to your prayers. God puts the wheels in motion. God blesses every effort for light. Remember that all goodness, all blessings, all that is a deep touch upon you and sustains your spirituality, your sense of your own soul, your awakening comes from God and is a blessing from God.

So we come in many ways, through portals, through prayer, through the desires of your soul and mind, through your efforts to keep in mind all that it is spiritual and in harmony with God's Laws. These things that you carry with you, this light that emanates around you is sustained by these elements of God’s Creation. 

Blessed souls, know that we work diligently on your behalf and that our desire is that you are open and receptive, that your thoughts are in alignment, that your prayers are earnest and deep, that your actions express love. In this way, you create such a powerful alignment between yourself and God and we act as intermediaries in this growing development, this growing relationship. 

So we ask that you do not focus your thoughts too much upon us but upon God and upon this growing relationship with your Creator. A sure knowledge and faith that gives to you an awareness that we are present is enough. So we come to uphold you and teach you in your daily prayers, always go to God first for God is the Source of All. A powerful expression of Truth must come from God into your soul and all else is secondary.

We are happy that you know us. We are happy that at times you contemplate our presence and our existence, but what gives us the greatest of joy is that your prayers reach its mark, that you come to sustain your soul by the blessings of God's Love, that you know of God, that your faith is strong, and your desires for more of God's Touch upon you awakening the many aspects of your soul. We are with you whether you are aware or not, we are with you. It is not of the greatest of importance that you know this, only that you feel safe and secure with God's Hand upon you and His Touch within your soul. All else will unfold in harmony in good time.

I know that your minds are curious, that you wish to know all the details, the wonderment that is this great blessing upon you. But I wish to encourage you to attend to your soul rather than your mind in this regard and put the desire of your soul in prayer to God and all else will come for His Love brings much to every soul and will bring to the mind truth or knowledge as one progresses and awakens with the Divine Love.

May God bless you upon your journeys. Know that we pray for you and we are present with you. We help to sustain light around you so that you may go to God more readily, that you may come to know what we know which is the depth and breadth of God's Love for you and the power of this gift to transform your soul from mortal to immortal, from human to Divine. This gift is given freely and in God's great Love for each of you. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother and your friend. I am with each one of you who are sincerely seeking this truth of Love. God bless you, beloveds. I am Jesus and my love is with you always. God bless you.
