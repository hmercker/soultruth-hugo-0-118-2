# Path of the Soul

July 24<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Punalu'u, Oahu, HI, USA

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am your brother and friend in the Grace of God… I am Yogananda.

I come into this beautiful prayer with so many hearts opening, every soul being touched.

As a Yogi I know very well the path of the pure soul, the perfected human and all the disciplines of fasting, meditation, pure diet, mantras and so forth. All these things that honor the soul and the mind and body and realize the worthiness and oneness of each individual. On this path one becomes pure, and the highest form of the natural love is expressed.

On the path of Divine love that you have chosen and been drawn to all these disciplines may be embraced and they are helpful but until the soul allows God to open up via His holy spirit to the infilling of His love there is only the natural. When one considers how do I pray how can I rise above my mind and all these thoughts in the material world? I say go within, go into your heart, that God may open you soul. Allow the deep longings to be at One with your Creator to supersede all others. This is all that is required. The words you say, the songs you may sing, should inform the soul to awaken, to ask, to open.  This is what is meant when we tell you this is the path of soul, your soul to God’s soul. This is truly the language that we speak in the Celestial realms, soul to soul. This is how our loving Creator brings His love to each soul. 

I go now that you may and all of us here be in the bliss and the joy and the glory of God’s love. All One in His love!

I am Yogananda.  May God bless you!
