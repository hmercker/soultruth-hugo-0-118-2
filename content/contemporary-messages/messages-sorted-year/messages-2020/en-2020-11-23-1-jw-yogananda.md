# Each Soul is a magnetic Center drawing to it what it desires

November 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Punalu'u, Oahu, HI, USA

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here Yogananda.  This circle of prayer, healing, and light comes together drawn into the love of God and the oneness that is felt in this communion. No matter how diverse, all are God’s children, and each soul is a magnetic center drawing to it what it desires. Should that be sensual desires, or the self- gratification of the senses, then those things, material things, money, food, sex, even (certain kinds of) music, that is what is drawn. When the soul begins to feel that this is not anything more than instant gratification it begins to long for a lasting connection. Whether this be in the oneness of the universe and the natural world, or the higher calling of oneness with the Creator, the embrace of God, that journey, that magnetism, will have no equal. As you are drawn to this prayer and this circle, God’s grace is drawn into your souls as you go within and open to His love. If you let your thoughts rise above the earth plane, you will draw light and healing and love. If you think the highest and wish the best, these thoughts become things and heal the world and send a blessing to those in need as you become a channel of God’s love.

There is much anger and frustration in the world and yet you can see the ray of hope beyond the crisis in the transformation that you so wish for your souls, for the world. Give it to God, Who will give you everything in return. As the Master said: *“seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all else will be given”*. How true this is. As you let go and you let God, and you give your will to the will of the Creator, all are blest. My guru, Sri Yukteswar, asked me once, *“if you were given the whole world, do you think it would be enough?”* Do you think it would satisfy the longings in your soul which go beyond that go beyond the material world? This satisfaction would not last my dear one and so I say to you, *“Let your longings ascend to the highest, let your soul awaken in the great love of God, all else will be given to you.”* I give you my love as do all those here in the grace of God, in the Celestial Heavens. I love you. I am your brother and friend, Yogananda.
