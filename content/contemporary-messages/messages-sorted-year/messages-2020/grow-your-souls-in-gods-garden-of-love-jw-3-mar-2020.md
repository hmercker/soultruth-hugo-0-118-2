# Grow your Souls in God’s Garden of Love

March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2020

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am Francis. I came in with my dear brother Yogananda, as we often travel together. He was very influenced by reading about my life and by his visit to Assisi during his life and he had a sense that I watched over him then, watched him grow and develop and progress. And when he came over, it was such a glorious time. And so, we often travel together. 

And I wanted to just touch base with you and ask you to remember the earth is a garden and each of you are caretakers, as God is the caretaker of your souls, He has allowed you to be caretakers of this earth during these times. 

As you live on earth, remember to be gentle and kind and nurturing. For whatever you put into the earth, you will get back tenfold and I say to you, as one who resides in the Celestial Realms, your prayers for God’s Love will be answered tenfold to a hundredfold. As my dear brother said, have faith, let go of doubt. Allow Love to replace fear. Walk upright in Love. 

May God bless you all. I am your brother in the Celestial Kingdom, Francis. God bless you.
