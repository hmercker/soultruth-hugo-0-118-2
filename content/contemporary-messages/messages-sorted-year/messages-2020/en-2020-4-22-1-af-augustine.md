# Keep Your Word Simple and Message Clear

April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2020

Mediumship Workshops, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

This is Augustine. There is so much to teach, my beloved students, so much to give to those who are yearning and seeking and thirsting for Truth and for Love. Remember that you cannot bring all the Truths forward at one time. Even in the sessions that you have planned together there is so much information that is available to you, so much guidance that has come through mediums and instruments and inspiration that continues to flow through each one of you and Truth that is growing within each one of you. Remember to keep your word simple, your message clear, these ideas given in a rhythm, a pacing that is easy for your students to absorb.

There will be time, ample time given for you to convey your Truths and your intentions to your charges. It will open in harmony. Doors will open for each one of your students and for yourselves, that you may all grow with strength and surety, with clarity and love within the Truths of God. Allow yourselves to be at peace regarding these efforts and know that you are being guided. Know that it is not so much the words that you speak but it is the atmosphere that you create in love, how you draw the angels into the midst of each who are a part of this circle. The angels will work diligently to impress upon each soul those Truths that are important to know, this reality that continues to grow within each of your students and yourselves. For are you not all progressing forward? Some are behind and some are ahead. This is the way it always has been.

You will be led, beloved souls. You will find your way. You will see clearly what it is that you are meant to teach. That clarity will come as you continue to be attuned to your souls, as you continue to pray for guidance, as you continue to see your way through the forest of thought to that place of soul Truth and clarity. It is as much a learning adventure for yourselves as it is for those who are learning with you.

These gifts, these opportunities to share your truths, your wisdom, your perceptions give to you a great blessing allowing you to clarify, to be sure and clear of what it is that you wish to convey to your brothers and sisters. God blesses all in these wondrous Circles of Light and all gain in some way from these ventures. You are blessed, beloved souls, to have so many gifts, so much to share, such love in your hearts and souls.

 God puts you in the forefront and beseeches you to be examples of His Love and His Truth. May you continue on that journey. May your souls continue to open and awaken to all that God has to give to you for you will be blessed mightily, beloved teachers. You will be given what you require. You will give from your souls what God requires of you. The flow of His Love is multi-dimensional and many gifts and Truths and blessings will come of it.

May God bless you. Your teacher Augustine is with you and very happy with your efforts and your progress in this regard. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Augustine and I love you. God bless you.
