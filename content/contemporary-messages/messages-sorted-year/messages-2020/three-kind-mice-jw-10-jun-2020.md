I am here Clare.   
 
I will be brief but I wish to share in this circle of light so many are here with you in your prayers, in this blessing. What a glorious thing it is.
 
I too offer all my love to my three kind mice for you are dear to me. Whatever it is you shall wish to accomplish I will help you and yes give you hope. I am a sister in Christ. May the love of God embrace you and be with you each. 

I am Clare of Assisi
