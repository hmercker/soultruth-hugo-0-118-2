# Put Love in the Airwaves

May 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Claire of Assisi. And I am with the beautiful one called Care as well. We came together to join you in prayer and to encourage you on your walk in Godâ€™s Love. Seek the highest, receive the highest, create that which touches the heart. Humanity needs to be lifted up and though I hesitate to use the word, I can see the situation has an air of desperation about it and frustration. 

So please act in love to bring this blessing to your family and friends however you encounter them. Put this in the airwaves and speak from your hearts, reach out from your souls, for God has blessed you each and you are dear to us. Be not afraid for you are all protected. We encourage you to make use of this time to bring forth that which is truth, that which is love, that which inspires and touches the heart. 

May it be so. As God is smiling upon all of you, we too are filled with joy for this meeting. God bless you. I am Claire.
