# Allowing the Love

June 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Judas. I have been with you today, three souls sharing their hearts, sharing their desires to be transformed, and reading what I gave to the dear brother in Ecuador.<sup>1</sup> One thing you can see is that even that dear brother did not get everything one hundred per cent as you can feel where there are hiccups but essentially what I wished to communicate through him he did so beautifully. And yes he was often very overwhelmed by his fears, so today you have read the panacea for this is prayer. And what did you all do? You have gone into prayer for God’s Love. You couldn’t have followed instructions any better.

Your souls now will process all the things that were discussed especially those things which separate you from being in grace, being in the Love of God, being in the flow as you say and allowing this to lead you. Allowing the love to inform you. When you seek answers with your soul and you go into prayer the answers come.

So as the dear sister remarked early on: *“It is so simple.”* It truly is. I am so very happy you are studying these messages together and not just my messages but all of those you are looking at in your little group. And I can tell you that many are looking on and listening to your discussions and are able to see the purity of your intentions and the goodness of your hearts and your souls' desire. It is a beautiful thing in God’s Love. 

Until we meet again may you all be blessed in prayer for God’s love, embraced in God’s love, lifted in Grace. I am your brother and friend in Christ, I am Judas. Go with God!
