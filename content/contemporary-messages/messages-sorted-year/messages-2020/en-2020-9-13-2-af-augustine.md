# You Carry Profound Truth in Your Soul

September 13<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. Each of you carries the truth within you. That truth motivates and prompts you to come together in prayer. The power of this truth, this Light that is God's Love residing within your souls will continue to motivate you and influence your lives, your thoughts and your expressions in the world. You will continue to awaken to truth.

There is little in the world that can keep you from truth for you have forged a deep bond between your soul and God’s Soul. You have insured that the truth that God wishes to impart to you will be given and is flowing as you pray and long and contemplate to be with God. You have fulfilled a very deep truth and destiny within you. You are destined to become at one with God. This is your journey. This is the path that you have chosen to take. You will not be thwarted nor disappointed in this illustrious journey of light.

You will come to know yourselves in ways and means that are not altogether common in your world. You will come to know the world, the universe, the Source of All which is God, in ways that many do not see or understand. You will put aside your reliance upon mindful deductions and logic as the primary means of understanding the world and come to that deeper place that is your soul where understanding comes as a gift, a brightening of truth, a beautiful gem the sparkles with many facets. So the truth that you will know will be deep and powerful, filled with love and joy. This is what many aspire towards, yet they do not understand how to awaken the soul. They are still stuck within the parameters of mindful thought and do not see beyond to the possibilities of the soul. 
Each of you have found your way, beloved souls. I urge you to have faith in this journey and to continue with your prayers, to become aware of the subtle changes deep within you, to allow these insights and experiences and awakenings to bubble forth into your conscious self so that you may indeed truly know and understand. That you may truly feel deeply the joy of God's Love and the joy of a soul connected and aware of God. As such, you will become a channel of light, a beacon of light in the world.

This will come not from your mindful intentions of being so but the reflexive outflowing of love and light that comes from your soul which will be God’s channel of Love in the world. You will change the world with your soul’s awakenings, with your true faith in God, with the power of love expressed in joy and wisdom, with your gifts unfolding in all their beauty and facets that will not only benefit your own soul but benefit many souls.

As you change and the world changes, so awakening begins. So you are like a fire that will light other fires of soul awakening, of soul transformation through sharing this Truth of God's Love, through being an example, through being your loving self. May God bless you in your journey, beloved souls. Know that we are with you always as you gather together. Together you create a great light in the world, a light that beams forth through all the dark spheres towards the Light of God and expands out into your world and brings hope and comfort to the souls who are longing, the souls who are distressed and in great need. So, you become a beacon of light for many, both mortals and spirits.

Continue in your efforts, beloved souls. Continue to be God’s channels of love. Continue to reach with every ounce and measure of your hearts to God. God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine. I am with you in your prayers as are many from the Celestial Kingdom. God bless you.
