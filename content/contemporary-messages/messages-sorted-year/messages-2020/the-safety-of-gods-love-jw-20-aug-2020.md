I am here Judas. I come in the Love of God to my dear friends as I watch over you and encourage you in the knowing as only we can know what awaits you. It is so important for each one of you to feel safe so that you can allow your hearts to open without fear, without distraction, being interrupted, or anything that would pull you away from the magnetism of God’s love.

When I was on earth the Master often took us aside to a place of refuge, a sanctuary where we could pray and be instructed. Of course, as you know, he balanced this with his public life and we accompanied him on that journey as well. But one must precede the other, and that is why it is so important for you to be in safety in your soul so that it may receive. This is so efficacious to the inflowing of God’s Love, accompanying the longings, accompanying faith, which yes indeed brings trust. Then as you are in God’s Grace fully exposed, the nakedness of your soul is clothed in the glorious blanket of protection and happiness of God’s Love. Is this not why you come to this circle? Of course, it is. So be open, have faith, trust in God, and walk and breathe in His Love that this world may be blessed.

I would only add that even if you are to go in public and bless one soul, touch one soul in the Love of God, you have put a star in your heavenly crown and the Father delights and we celebrate that you have given the gift, the greatest gift of all to another in your sharing. 

Stay in the love and we will stay with you. You are so dear to all here and you are my friends on the path to the Celestial Kingdom where I reside in the love of God. Go in peace and know I love you. I am your brother in Christ always. I am Judas of Kerioth.
