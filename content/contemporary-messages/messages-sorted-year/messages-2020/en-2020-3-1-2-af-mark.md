# Draw Yourselves to Light

March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020

FUSC, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Mark received by Al Fike

I am Mark. It is important that you all draw to yourselves Light, that the blessings of God and the blessings of Heaven may rain down upon each one of you, as is your birthright, beloved souls, to know this Light, to know the Light of God's Love, to know the Light of His Touch of healing and Grace and upliftment that you may be carried forth in Light, that you may be protected and guided in Light, that you may be a channel of Light and Love in the world.

Here in this place, this church, are the blessings of Light given to you as a gift from God. So, I urge you, my beloved friends, open yourselves to what is given. Bring to you, close to your bosom, all that God wishes to give to you. Seek this Light as you continue to find your way through life and understand the truth of life. Seek Light and open your souls, beautiful souls that you are, to the Grace of God which is available to you at any moment, given your desire and choice to receive this blessing, to be with God in humility and Grace, in humbleness, in desire and longing, those true and deep seated places within you opening to God, beseeching God to bless you.

May this be your gift. May this be your blessing, beloved souls. I am Mark and I am with you in your efforts in this church. I am with you in every effort made to bring Light. May God bless you in these efforts. My love is with you. God bless you.
