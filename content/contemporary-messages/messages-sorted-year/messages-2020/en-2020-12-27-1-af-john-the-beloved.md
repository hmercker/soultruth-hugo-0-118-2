John the Beloved received by Al Fike

God bless you beloved souls, I am John the Beloved.

You are all entering a river, a river of Love, empowered and directed by God’s Will. It carries you forward, not like the rivers of your world, this river goes ever upward into greater light. It carries you beyond the barriers of the earthly world into the expansive joy of God and His loving care for each one of you.

You are being transformed beloved souls by this great gift of Love. You are being healed and awakened by this great gift of Love. Seek it with every moment of every day. May the yearnings of your heart be full and may you know this with every breath. Knowing that indeed you have entered this river of love. That it carries you forward, awakens you, immersing you into light and truth, peace, and joy.

For when you are in alignment with God, you travel upon this river which brings all that you require to awaken your soul, to open your minds and your hearts to the truth of His Presence, His Hand firmly upon each one of you.

Be at peace beloved souls. Know that you are truly loved, you are truly guided, that you will truly find your way upon this glorious path of Love. For it is your destiny, the force that carries you forward will not diminish but strengthen and as your faith increases so will be the pace and flow of this river and you will find great exhilaration and joy in this flowing of Love, awakening you to all of the possibilities and potentials of your soul.

May God bless you beloved souls and keep you embraced in the Living Waters of God’s Great Soul. God bless you. I am John. I am with you. My love is with you. My prayers are with you. God bless you.
