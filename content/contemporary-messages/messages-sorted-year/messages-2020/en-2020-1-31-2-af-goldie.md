Goldie received by Al Fike

Dear souls, beloveds, I am Goldie. Open your hearts to the joy of love. Open yourselves to all the joy that there is in life for what is this great journey of the soul without joy? One may know all the words of Truth collecting within your minds and understanding, but without joy, what is the point? Be joyful, my friends, for God wants you to know the great beauty and upliftment that His Love brings. Dance and sing and embrace one another in joy for in this expression of your souls is the true meaning of love. Love connects. Love brings you together and binds you together in joyful recognition of the beauty of your own souls created by God.

Truly feel this in your hearts, my friends, and know that when you are truly with God, it is joyful, truly joyful. With His Love expanding within your souls, awakening, and bringing the great awakening and knowing of His beautiful Creation, all is joy, all is joy.

May God bless you, my friends. My love is with you. My love is with you. Feel it in your hearts and know that Goldie loves you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
