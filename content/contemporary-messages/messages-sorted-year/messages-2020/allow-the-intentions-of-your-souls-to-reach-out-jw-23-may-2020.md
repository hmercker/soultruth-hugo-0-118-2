# Allow the Intentions of your Souls to Reach Out

May 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your brother Francis. You have often heard that we call you children, brothers, sisters, our friends because truly we are all God’s children. This you know and as the Master remarked that one must become like a child to enter the Kingdom in innocence, in openness. 

These wounds that come to you now, which come to the fore, are long held, many from childhood. As you pray for and receive the Father's Love, this love expiates those wounds and removes them. They are replaced with the Joy and the Light of the child born again in God’s Love. Truly the meaning of those words “You must be born again to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.” 

In this sense we all become children of the Father in the most beautiful and glorious way. It is no accident that those of you who came today to be in this circle shared your hearts, shared your experiences, because there was much empathy within this group. We can feel it and we honor it as we honor you each one on your journey. There is nothing more important than reaching out in prayer. 

You need not think of this as being formal, being on your knees, having prayer beads or a rosary or a mantra or particular words. I suggest you allow the intentions of your souls to reach out during your day in that deeper request “Dear God I need to feel Your love, please touch my soul, protect me from any harm, from any negativity, allow me to be a blessing to all.” One can do this in any given moment on any given day and into the night and as your prayers open to receive the light and the love of Our Heavenly Father, it shall be yours.

I am your brother and friend in God’s love and a disciple of the Master in the Celestial heavens. May God continue to embrace you in His Love and change you so that great Joy will be yours. God bless you. I am Francis.
