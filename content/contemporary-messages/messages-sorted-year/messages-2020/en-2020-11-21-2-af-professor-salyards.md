Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, it is your Professor Salyards and I give you greetings and hallelujahs! If this is what you wish, then of course we in the Celestial kingdom are happy to acknowledge you, to give you that pat upon the shoulder that you desire. For indeed you are all working as one, exploring the possibilities and potentials of this great venture. And each of you, as you have seen today, can contribute greatly to these efforts. Your perspectives and insights are important and I urge you all to share them as much as you can. For it is in these collaborations and conversations that you awaken certain aspects of your mind and your soul to those aspects and elements of what is required to set forth the foundation of this beautiful venture.

It comes slowly, but indeed it comes with a resolute determination that reflects the Will of God, that in God's plan there is a strength, there is a power, there is the capacity to fulfill these intentions, divine intentions, for the awakening of humanity. Allow yourselves to be immersed in this river, this river of Love, this river that will bring the fulfillment of purpose and the expression of the soulâ€™s desire to serve.

The momentum of this river is God's Will to bring you forth into the landscape of great potential, great opportunities to serve. As you move on this river and beseech your brothers and sisters to join you, so many will be immersed in this wonderful flow of Love and truth. And many will find great fulfillment in this and many will serve many who will served many and on it will go and multiply until the world has come to realize the power of love to bring change and healing, truth and upliftment, joy and expression to the great souls that are each individual in your world.

You carry the staff of truth, beloveds. You are channels of love. You have great desire to serve. You have within your souls the Divine Love glowing within. You are uniquely qualified to bring this endeavor to fruition. You will find your way with insights and dreams, with thoughts and feelings, with prayer and love. All the aspects of your unique, individual selves will come into play and we will assist you so that these parts of you will come into alignment and will work towards great awakening, great expressions, great truth from within. And you will find that you will be uplifted, that you will come to a new level of awakening and expression.

**These things, when guided and blessed by God, bless all who are involved. All will benefit and all will come into greater light. Remember this, you are as much the student as the teacher; you are as much the child of God as you are the leader of man. Humility,  focus and simplicity, these three things are important and need to be applied to everything that you do and that enveloping all of this is love and the desire to express and bring greater love into the world.**

Be at peace, my beloved friends, be at peace and know that all is unfolding as it should, that you are not distracted but you continue to be within this river of intention and Love. And it will carry you to surprising places, opening up surprising insights and will bring souls into your midst in surprising ways. This is what brings the excitement of the journey, is it not? That the unexpected is to be expected, that there is no road that is foretold and set in stone, rather it follows the course of this river that meanders in the landscape of truth. And so the unfolding of your course is not to be planned, rather that you may respond with acknowledgement and desire to be a part of the intended course that God has guided rather than you. Though there is always a need for planning and to set forth your intentions in this material world, remember that beneath the veneer of these things is a great and powerful force that will direct you forward and bring you to where you are intended to be and that the expressions of your efforts will be in alignment with God's Will.

God bless you upon this beautiful journey of life, that you may come to know wondrous things, that your souls may know the joy of truly being loved by God, acknowledged by God, that your souls will be the fulfillment of God's great gift that is your soul. God's great intention which is the awakening of your soul, the transformation of your soul, the realization of the power of your soul to love, to be loved, and to be within the truth of love. God bless you, beloveds. I am your Professor Salyards and I am well pleased with your efforts, well pleased indeed. God bless you. God bless you, my friends.
