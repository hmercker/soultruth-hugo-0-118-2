# Demonstration of Mediumship / Talk about Spiritual Spheres

November 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020

FUSC, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

May God bless you all. I am your teacher, Augustine. Yes, I reside within the Celestial Kingdom and have done so for many centuries. I am happy to hear my beloved student speak of these truths of the spirit world, for indeed, each soul born upon this world of yours is destined to travel through these mentioned worlds of the spirit, developing and growing, discovering their own true selves and true natures, seeking truth in many ways and experiences as life unfolds in this prolific journey that is your individual path towards enlightenment. I would encourage each one of you to seek to enlighten your soul with the gifts that God has to give, with the Love that is available to you which God is ever willing to put within your soul if you so desire this.

Many are enamored with the mind and seek to enhance and fill the mind with many things. For these aspects of life, these elements of truth, these ways of the universe are available to you and are indeed captivating to the mind. But for each individual to be whole within themselves, to truly express and develop all aspects of themselves, the soul must be awakened. And it is in your prayers to God to receive the gift of Divine Love that this awakening begins so that the journey is not merely half of what can be, but fully what can be upon the experiences of your Earth plane and beyond.

So many truths will come. So much will be made available to you. So much will be given to you by God and His angels and by the spirits of light who ever are eager to uphold, to protect, to guide each individual, provided they are open and willing to receive, to come into alignment with all of these elements, factors, which bring a soul, in time, into at-onement with God.

So this is a journey which I encourage you all to take, is the journey in which we are here to uplift you and encourage you forward. And this journey is eternal.

May you find your way upon the Divine Path as we are fond of calling it, the path towards at-onement with God. In this way, you will know a joy, an aspect of love that is deep and rewarding and ever growing as your souls awaken to Godâ€™s Love. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Augustine, your teacher. My love is with you. God bless you all.
