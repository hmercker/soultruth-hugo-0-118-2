I am here Eileen. You can think of me as your dear Auntie Eileen who watches over you, and though it has been some time since I commmunicated with this one, and in this way, I have not been absent from your lives and the conversations. 
  
On this day the messages you read and spoke of and conversed about had a thread going through them. That thread which was expressed in having a conversation with the Heavenly Father, that thread will weave a beautiful design in your lives. You could look at it as painting a picture and just allowing the flow of creativity to take over as you open to receiving. The Heavenly Father as you know is never absent and His love is always available. So, allowing yourself to talk to God as I did, allowed God to talk to me. This I conveyed in my writings which I am so pleased have carried on and have influenced you in ways that are beneficial to the progression of your souls. 
   
I would add for this group to start your day in this openness to God in allowing God to work through you during the day and asking to be a vehicle, a channel for His grace. And before you sleep ask us to be with you that you may have a connection to the Celestial realms and above all love and protection around you in your dreams.  For it is often we find the only available time in people’s lives when they are most open is during their sleep time and in their dreams. And when they are in harmony, we come to them and give them guidance with God’s love. 
   
I wish to say on behalf of all here we are so happy that you come together for this study, to receive guidance , to share your thoughts, your feelings your growth your difficulties with each other in trust , knowing you are safe and being in prayer together for the great gift of God’s love.
  
You have all our love and support. Please do not forget this and whenever you go to God, we shall assist in doing His bidding on your behalf. My love and blessings and gratitude and my embrace in the Grace of God to each one of you. I am Eileen.
