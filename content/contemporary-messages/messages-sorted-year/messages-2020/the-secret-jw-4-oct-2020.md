# The Secret

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here, your friend your brother in Christ in God’s love, I am Francis. Thank you for coming together to receive the love of our Creator and to honor me and the work that I continue to do. I wish to address the dear brother on the Isle of Guernsey for his commitment to keep the flame of love and light alive in the little chapel and I promise him whenever he calls, I will come. For there will be many asking a healing and we shall be there to facilitate.

To this beautiful humble group coming together with your deep aspirations, I tell you this is the secret and you have discovered that when you go to God in humbleness, when you open to His great love and infinite mercy, you receive it.

Beyond all the dogma and catechism and order of the church in my day, my brothers and I, and my dear sisters, we had indeed discovered this secret. The love of God that came into our souls enabled us to go forth and bring the gift that we had received, the message of the truth of God’s love, to all. For in our poverty we had received the greatest abundance of riches. You can bring this gift through prayer to any and all regardless of their beliefs or non-beliefs, if they are willing to join you in humbleness to God, the floodgates of heaven open and current of love is bestowed upon all; every soul that comes and asks.

This secret you have in your hearts and this love you have in your souls and the Presence of God and the light on your path will carry you to immortality and the Celestial heavens. I have said before that Divine love is the bridge between heaven and earth and you are walking on this bridge. We are walking with you. Again, thank you for honoring my work but I tell you that there are many unknown to the world but honored here in this realm and assisting in this work. We are here at your all. May the peace of God’s love be with you all on your journey to His kingdom.

I am your brother and friend in the love of God. I am Francis. May God’s love be with you all.
