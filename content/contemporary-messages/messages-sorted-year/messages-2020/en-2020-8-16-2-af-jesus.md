August 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I give you with a blessing. I am your brother and friend. I come to assure you that each have been guided. Each knows one another through their soul’s knowings that they are truly bonded in this Love and blessing of Light that is God’s Touch upon your soul. I shall come again and again to bless you all upon your journey for you are precious to me and precious to the world, great soldiers of Light who struggle to bring the Truth to humanity. So you are blessed indeed upon your efforts for you do God's Will to some degree and you will know God's Will to a greater degree as you continue to walk this Path Divine towards at-onement with God.

I am with you. I walk with you all and my love for you is great, beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. I am your friend and brother. I am Jesus.
