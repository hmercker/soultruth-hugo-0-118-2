Direct Voice, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, it is Seretta Kem. I am encouraged by some of your conversations regarding the gift of direct voice, that there is interest and a desire to participate in such a program. I am quite willing to assist you all in these efforts, provided your commitment is there. For it requires a great deal of commitment, a great deal of your efforts, your focus, your thoughts, your prayers and your presence with others to develop this gift. In the future there will be opportunities for you to become a part of a group concentrating on these gifts, developing and opening to them. It is important that you understand that a grounding in Divine Love, a thorough understanding of It and an experience with Divine Love is important that your souls may be filled with this gift of God's Love. This is the very foundation of such a project.

And I see all of you traveling, reaching out to many souls. Your work continues to unfold. You will find opportunities coming to you in surprising ways. You will come to know a deep guidance from God so that you may fulfill this great plan of God's for the salvation of humanity. So much awaits each one of you. There is so much work to do, so many souls to connect with and to bring this great, joyful Truth of the Father’s Love. You will continue in your prayers together in these ways and means over the wires. They will continue and there will be times where you will be together in the flesh, praying together, experiencing that beautiful and sacred bond in prayer for the Father’s Love. God has much in store for each of you. May you continue to open yourselves, both your souls and your minds to the Will of God, to the Love of God, and come to know His Will as part of your own. To be His channels of Love in the world, to walk in the world as a Light, to express your many gifts and to come to know your true selves in all its beauty and wonderment, the wonderment of the soul awakened in Love.

We are with you, beloved souls. We know your desires, your thoughts, your intentions. And as such, we continue to uphold you, to guide you if we may, and to assist you in your prayers so that you may reach higher and higher upon this great journey to at-onement with God.

May your souls be filled with His Love. May you come to know the power of this Love, the effects of this Love expressed through each one of you, a prism for God's Love to be refracted and flow into your world. This light shall continue to reach many. May God bless you, beloved souls, on your journeys. I am Seretta Kem and I am happy to be with you tonight in prayer. God bless you. My love is with you. God's Love is with you. God bless you.
