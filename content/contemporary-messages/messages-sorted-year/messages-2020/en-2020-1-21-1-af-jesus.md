# Jesus will Lead us to God's Love

January 21<sup>st</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Take my hand, beloveds, as I walk towards God. Take my hand and I will lead you to that great fountainhead of Love and we shall bathe together in this Love. As it pours within us we shall know the glories of God and the wonderment of His Great Being and the great firmament of His Creation. We shall know the wonders of the universe, the greatness of all that God has created, the beauty of all that is and will be. That His Love will open those portals of experience and understanding that the soul may deliver to each of you. Take my hand and I will show you the way.

My love is with you, beloved souls, always. I am with you. God bless you. I am Jesus. God bless you.
