I am here your brother in Christ, Judas of Kerioth. Yes it is me. I have been with the dear brother today and he was asking me earlier: *“Why is there not more mention of praying to God for God’s love in what became what you know of as the Gospels and Epistles and writings of the apostles.”* He was wondering why is this kind of obscured. That is a good question. 

So first of all as you may know already, much of what made it into what became the new testament, those writings, has been retranslated, interpolated, changed many times over and through those words received through James Padgett and others they have told you many a time that words were changed and much of what they said or wrote was not included and much of what they did not say or write was interpolated. So knowing that I wanted to impress upon my dear brother here and all of you that if you do read between the lines and you just take the words of the master, you can see those words themselves show his oneness with God and the love that flowed and emanated from him - directing all to God, directing all to knock, to ask and listen and look. 

And those of us who followed him we were simple. Yes a few of us had some education but mostly we were very simple. But you know there is something about being simple, being local. We had you might say built in lie detectors or BS detectors. So when we heard the words coming out of Jesus, our souls knew that he possessed the truth and what emanated from him was a light, lighting the world, lighting our world, and he showed us the way to the kingdom of God’s Love - the Way, the Light and the Truth. His wish for all is to carry this love in your souls that the dear brother Elijah spoke of. Carry that light to all. 

Imagine your words whether serious or in humor or in jest were as if a prayer to each one. It is so important so important , so needed to take words of truth words of love words of forgiveness, words of encouragement and hope to all. Most especially during this time on earth. You who are so blessed with this great Love of God that you draw us to your circle as you are touched by God’s Love we are touched by your hearts and are happy to be of service. 

May the love and light of the Heavenly Father, the Most Holy One be yours. And may you shine that light and give that love and hope in faith to all. I am your brother and friend in God’s love. I am Judas of Kerioth.
