I am here your brother and friend in God’s love, I am Yogananda. I wish to speak on the discernment of truth. There has been much discussion both publicly and privately and there have been many messages concerning this subject of being in your mind or being in your souls. I wish to give you a very simple way to discern the difference.

When you hear a message, or read a message or a book, or you hear music when it carries the vibration of God’s Love it touches your soul. When the words or the vibrations touch your curious mind to cause you consider all the options, all the possibilities, I say that ultimately that this too can affect your soul in the sense that you are moved to take on something which will benefit your soul. 

But, simply said the glorious vibrations of God’s Love cause the progression of the soul, the transformation of the heart, and when you feel this miraculous joy, when you allow the Creator to bestow this Love upon you, you will not wonder if it is true. 

May the blessing of God’s love in this circle of light be upon you all that we may be One, as these are the deepest longings of our souls. With all my love and blessings in the Grace of God I am your brother and friend, Yogananda. God bless you.
