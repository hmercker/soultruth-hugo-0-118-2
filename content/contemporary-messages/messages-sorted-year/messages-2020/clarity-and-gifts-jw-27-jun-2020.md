# Clarity and Gifts

June 27<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your sister, Clare of Assisi. 

Sometimes in life you have an epiphany where what was once not clear becomes perfectly clear, and that clarity results in you making a change in your lives. Of course, you know that this is what happened to Francis. As for me, I just knew. I was so inspired by what Francis had chosen and his brothers. And with you, you have had the privilege of clarity in the grace of God where everything becomes crystalized, where error falls away, and it is quite easy to know where to walk and what decisions to make.
 
At some point when you are stabilized, in the grace of God and your prayer is deep and continuous, then you are in the flow of God’s love, and circumstances arise which allow you to utilize your gifts whatever they may be. So, you need not be concerned about when and where and how.
 
Only pray to be changed in God’s love, to walk in grace, to be in the flow, and all things will become clear. And many will be blessed by God through your gifts. What a wonderful thing!

I shall be with the dear sister<sup>1</sup> this eve, who is recovering and surround her with my love. I hope I have been of service to you, and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak again. May God bless you, shower you with love.

I am your sister and friend in Christ. I am Clare
