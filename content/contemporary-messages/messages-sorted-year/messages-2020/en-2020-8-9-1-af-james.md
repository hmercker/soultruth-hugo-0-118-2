# The Longing of the Soul Must Come Forth to God

August 9<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

James received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am James, brother of Jesus. Many of us from the Celestial Spheres have com to be with you in this moment of prayer beseeching God to bless our souls. This prayer is the cornerstone of all who seek to open and transform their souls upon the Divine Path. We in the Celestial Kingdom as well as you on Earth and all the spirits in between these two planes of existence must come to God in this way, this humble way, to receive the gift of His Love. There is no other way to open the door to this blessing. Though the words may be different, even wordless, the longing of the soul must come forth to God. The longing that says, *“I desire to be blessed by Your Essence, Your Love, to flow into my soul awakening my soul, transforming and healing my soul.”*

There is no other way, beloveds. Even those who have no understanding of this Truth who come to God in this humble and direct way will be blessed. No matter their colour or creed, religion or culture, each has within them soul longing for Truth, for God, for Love. Each soul knows that in the existence of the Universe there is a Source of All Love that exists and is available to bring this blessing forward. One may not know God and yet within this longing of the soul there is an understanding of God. One may not recognise God but within the faculties of the soul is the capacity to do so.

Once the soul has been ignited by this gift, this blessing, this soul fire as our dear brother calls it, then these faculties that enable the awakening and the recognition of the existence of God, the existence of this blessing of Love, the existence of many things of God's Creation will come to each soul. Those who persist upon this path will come to know God, will come to recognise your own soul and will come to be in alignment with all that is in God’s Creation.

This is the power of Love, the power of God's Love. We pray together, do we not, my beloved brothers and sisters? All who are here whether they be in spirit or in the flesh, pray for the awakening of humanity. Pray for the dissolution of all darkness and ignorance, pain and suffering, all the conditions that have been created by humanity that are not in alignment with God. The power of a simple prayer given wholeheartedly and sincerely could change the world, for the power of this gift given in prayer is what will transform humanity, open the eyes, the ears, the perceptions, the wisdom of the soul.

May you all be gifted with this great awakening and come to truly know yourselves, and be in alignment with God. God bless you, beloved souls. I am James and I am happy to be with you all in this Circle of Light. My love is with you. God bless you.
