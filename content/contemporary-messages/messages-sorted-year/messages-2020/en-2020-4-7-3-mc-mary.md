Mary received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you, I am Mary. I bring my blessing of love and the tenderness that my heart has for each and every one of you. May you open widely in your hearts and souls, for the eternal inflowing of God’s Love, opening up to receive this great blessing that shall wash away all wounds and bring healing, the healing that each of you so desire.  Awakening your soul drop by drop, transforming you, enlivening you, and bringing forth the essence of your soul and its desire and purpose to be expressed on your beloved Earth.

I have said to you many a time before that I watch over the children as a mother would watch over her biological children. I have a special role for each of you on Earth, one that God has blessed me with, the gift of humanity’s children, the gift of nurturing the children of Earth. I am your Heavenly Mother and you are my earthly children. My presence has been with each of you at different times. I wish to let you know that you may call upon me in times where you feel troubled or worried and also times where you are celebrating joyously in elation. For I am there to be with you, beside you, bringing my love, showering you with grace and a tenderness so that each one of you may feel you have someone next to you.

These times that you are in where you are all being asked to have distance from one another as you call it, isolating, these can be very difficult times for those souls who do not have loved ones near them. Their sense of isolation can deepen. There are even some of you who are experiencing the seriousness of isolation, for your human nature desires touch. Your human nature desires to be connected. Many of you are experiencing a deep sense of separation upon your Earth. Perhaps not you individually who are gathered here for you have a community of love, but there are many upon your Earth who are feeling more isolated then they have done so in their daily routine.

Keep these beautiful souls in your heart and in your prayers. For if it were you that were experiencing such a situation, you would want the prayers of another. You would welcome all the loving help that strangers could offer. These souls who are going through deep isolation, my heart aches for. For as I love you, I love them. There is no difference. I see the beauty of who they are. I see their deep struggles. My love is showered upon them and I am with them with comfort hoping they can feel my love.

These changing times, dear ones, shall remain on Earth for some time longer but as we have promised you, they are necessary in order to bring balance back upon your Earth. There will be times ahead that each of you feel a deep connection to one another. You will be able to have and hold the love and the eyesight seeing those strangers that you pass by as your brother and as your sister. You will have the ability to be more accepting of others, releasing judgment. This is all by the Grace of God’s Love. Embrace yourselves. Embrace the beauty of your soul. Embrace the beauty of your mind. Embrace the beauty of your life. For it is in your ability to embrace what is that you shall rest with great ease through these changing times.

But please, I ask you to remember those who are less fortunate. Have your soul say a little prayer to God for these many souls on your Earth. It is not necessary that you need to know specifically who they are or who you are praying for but to ask your Heavenly Father to protect to love to guide and help awaken all souls.

I am deeply grateful that you turn to God and awaken your souls with the Divine Essence. When you pass into spirit, I shall come and introduce myself to each and every one of you and what a blessing it will be for us to come together. God bless you. God bless each and every one of you. My love is with you. I am Mary and I pray for each one of you. God bless you.
