Augustine received by Helge Mercker

Beloved child, I am here, your teacher Augustine.

I come tonight to write about the awakening of one’s faculties of the soul. In the quest to realise and recognise the inner parts of oneself, one is required to spend time alone in contemplation observing oneself, in focussing on the patterns of one’s behaviours, observing what brings joy and what creates a fulfilled calling from the soul. There are various methods and ways taught through different intellectual approaches in the pursuit of finding the so called true self.

As we know, through the process of receiving Divine Love the soul’s faculties and tendencies eventually become clear and the means of bringing forth this new gained happiness and realization of ever flowing love is confirmed. With this new gained harmony opportunities appear, providing an environment in which a gift or faculty may be displayed and recognized. In many ways it is like opening up a book and suddenly the writings and pictures become clear telling the story of a beautiful creation of God. Each page brings new discoveries, new prose, new songs, new colors, and each chapter reveals a new soul trait or characteristic. Once the book has been opened it is very difficult to put it down.

Thus, we write our own stories, filled with many pages of experiences, of wisdom, of knowledge, of teachings etc. And so, you too, my dear child, are writing your story of your life’s journey to God. The precious Gift of God, His Divine Love, helps to unlock the book, to open it up and turn the pages. The Gift ever increasing through soulful prayers asking for God’s Love to fill the soul will reveal the writings as one goes deeper and deeper into the beauty of one’s soul, awakened and eventually transformed through this Love.

May you all come to read your soul books. May you all be dedicated to reading the next page of your soul, the next awareness and recognition of soul-gift, displaying in wisdom and clarity its soul faculties, reaching the hearts of others who seek to discover their souls. Bring forth the love gained, the truth experienced, the many blessings gifted and live life with fulfilled purpose.

I am your teacher and this is the lesson of today. Turn the page and read the next chapter my child, and you will be surprised what God wishes for you to see. I will come again and bring you another lesson and bring my love and support. I am with you in your prayers and I help you to learn the Truth of God’s Love and His Universe. I wish you a good night and God bless you my daughter. Augustine loves you. Good night.
