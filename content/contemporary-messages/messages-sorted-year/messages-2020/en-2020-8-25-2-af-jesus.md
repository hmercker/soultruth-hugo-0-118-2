Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I come. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. Yes, we walk together into the Light of God's Love. Though I may be your older brother, you are my brothers and sisters. I am with you as we are all family in this great journey towards God. Though I reside in the Celestial Heavens and you are upon this Earth, there is no distance between us when the power of Love connects and brings us together in harmony.

Know that I am always with you and in my heart you are with me, that we walk together hand-in-hand into the Light, into the Grace of God and are ever thus within this wonderful river of Love. God brings us all together. God's Love makes it possible for our souls to connect one to another to another making this beautiful relationship of love a real and lasting part of our lives together. So it will be, beloved souls, all children of God, all within His embrace, all receiving His great gift of Love, growing, expanding, transforming in this gift of Love.

Know that I am with you and you are with me, never to leave, never for this bond to be severed for it is for all eternity, beloved children. All eternity we shall be together, in joy, in truth, in the ever-unfolding experience of our souls in relationship with God and Godâ€™s universe of Love. You are with me. I am with you.  And so it shall be forever more.

God bless you, my beloveds. God bless you upon our journeys together. My love is with you. God bless you.
