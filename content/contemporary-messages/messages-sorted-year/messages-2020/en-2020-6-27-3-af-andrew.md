# Respond With Love to Those Who Seek to Connect With You

June 27<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Mediumship Workshops, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Andrew received by Al Fike

God places before you many opportunities to serve, to teach, to be with your brothers and sisters in prayer, and so you will find that these doorways will open and it is for you to select which ones you may enter and which ones you may not, for the opportunities are great. There are many things that you may do, many avenues you may take, many approaches that you may express and bring into concrete form, so that you may teach  within a structure that allows your brothers and sisters to understand these Truths. I ask you to consider these opportunities in your prayers, to allow yourselves to be open to the many possibilities, that your gifts may be expressed and bring into these possibilities in serving God.

May the Will of God continue to be expressed through each one of you. Yes, many are drawn, many have great need to be counseled, to be assured, to be comforted, to be blessed. Each of you will find that your days will fill with these efforts from others to be with you, to connect, to seek out your guidance, your wisdom, your love. This is what being an instrument, a channel for God is all about, my beloved friends, to allow the opportunities to wash over you, to respond in love, to walk upon this Divine Path guided and in the Grace of God. As you do so, so many more opportunities will come your way. Many souls will come upon your path.

Much work still awaits each one of you and many gifts still await the awakening within. As you continue to respond to God's invitation to serve, so these gifts are given, an opening, a doorway for their expression.

God bless you beloved souls, I am Andrew, your friend and servant from the Celestial Kingdom. God bless you and keep you in His Love. Precious souls, how important you are in this work for the redemption of humanity in Love. God bless you. My love is with you.
