Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Yogananda, I am your brother and friend and your guide and protector.

I come in the Love of God. So many messages from us in such a short period of time you have received. I watched you as you were amazed at your own gift, or shall I say gifts, in such abundance, as you traverse them, correcting this and that, doing little edits, and then occasionally one would strike you, and as you have been doing you will post this and share with others. This bears much fruit and I encourage you as I have been doing, guiding you, influencing you, in this endeavor. I would say it is not wise to let your mind be troubled by any of this, whether it is received or not, for you have no idea of how many you reach beyond the scope of your vision. So, we have encouraged you to post and will continue doing so as we often guide you to a particular message which we feel would be most helpful to the many, although sometimes to the few, for we work with all without judgement. I would not say or suggest that you put yourself in a position that results in severe criticism or jealousy or a response that is less than loving. And you need not respond to negativity, and as I have said, do not curse the darkness but praise the light. This is your work. Whether someone decides to repost or remove should not be your concern. For you are reaching many. Be humble, let your heart and your souls desire be in the forefront and not your mind wondering about the destination or you seeking approval. We approve, we love you, and we thank you, and your brother for your service. Go in the grace of God today and always, and we shall be with you. With all my love and in Godâ€™s Grace.

I am Yogananda. Go in peace.
