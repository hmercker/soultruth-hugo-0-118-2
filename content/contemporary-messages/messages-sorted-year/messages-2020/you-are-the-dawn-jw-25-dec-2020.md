I am here Mary, I am your sister and friend and the mother of Jesus.  I too come to celebrate his birth and the bestowal of God’s Love. As a mother, when you are carrying a child, if you have any awareness you have a sense of carrying something sacred within you, something alive. It is a blessed feeling, and you can imagine how I felt carrying my oldest who had the seeds of God’s Love in his soul and my knowing, not in a conscious way, that he was the Messiah, but feeling something from heaven was within me. 

I will relate this idea of being pregnant to every soul that has prayed for God’s Love. For when that soul receives this Love it becomes impregnated with the new birth in the Love of God, who makes no distinction whether that soul be male or female, rich or poor, religious or non- religious. Every soul that comes with true longings for God’s Love with an open heart, every soul will receive the blessing of His Love, a seed implanted in the soul with the promise of immortality and eternal life that we here in the celestial realm live. We wish this for you my dear ones with all our hearts, with all the love in our souls. 

When you are in doubt, when you are skeptical, when you are troubled in any way, we always encourage you to go into prayer and ask God to touch your soul and to let go of everything that separates you from Him, in Faith, in Trust, in the knowing that He will provide you with the greatest gift of all. This was the message my son brought to the world and you have preserved it and you carry on with it in the midst of a time of great turbulence and fear and darkness. Each one of you is carrying the light of the love of God. 

Know this - you are not alone. I speak not only of us here in spirit that come to you and guide you and assist you, but every soul around the world with the sincere longings in their hearts to be at one with their Creator. You have indeed created what you call the *‘lattice of light’*. You have planted the seeds of a new world, of a new time on earth. It has been said: *‘the darkest hour is always before the dawn.'*  

I tell you my dear friends, beloved children of God, you are the dawn and God shines His light on each one of you. And my son blesses you with his great love in the grace of the Father, this day and always. With all my love and affections and the blessings of my son, and my Joseph and all of those here in the spirit world in this beautiful time of Hanukkah, Christmas and a New Year. May God bless you. I love you. I am Mary the mother of Jesus. God bless you.
