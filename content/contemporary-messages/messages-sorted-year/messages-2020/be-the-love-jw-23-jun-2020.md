# Be the Love

I am your brother and friend Gandhi. I am your brother in Christ and yes a disciple of the master in God’s love.  Thank you for allowing me to come. 

When I spoke the words: *“Be the change you wish to see in the world,”* I meant that people should live in love, kindness, compassion, peace, non violence and brotherhood and sisterhood. And whatever their spiritual beliefs they could be one in the Love of God. So now if you reflect on my words I wish you to see them in a new light, the light of God’s love. Be the change and be changed in God’s Love. Bring that to the world. Bring with it what you will in kindness and charity and whatever you can give on the material plane but above all be present with the Love that you hold in your souls. Give this gift, be this change. As you know this is all that truly matters and this Love, this Love Divine, will change everything. It will draw unto you every good and perfect gift. It will bring peace to wherever you walk. It will bring you protection and joy to your hearts. Oh how we wish to see this in the world. Be the light because you are God’s children as are we. 

May the light of love of our glorious Creator be in your souls and shine forth from you to each one. God bless you all. I am your brother and friend and a redeemed soul and an inhabitant of the Celestial heavens. I am Gandhi.
