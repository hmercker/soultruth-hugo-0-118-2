# Yogananda explains Kriya Yoga and God’s Love

September 13<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Yogananda in the grace of God. My dear brothers, my young friend was asking about Kundalini yoga and those energies associated with that practice. I wish him to know that I took a form of this yoga when I developed what is called Kriya yoga and brought it to the West. But I made a very simple exposition. Of course, with my students we did the asanas of Hatha Yoga, various postures and exercises and some of those associated with Kundalini, which were, energizing asanas or postures.

When we would meditate I would tell my students get comfortable, sit up straight with your spine straight, your hands relaxed and open, center on your heart, allow it to open. Feel the energy coming from the soles of your feet, the subtle energy ascending through the body through all the chakras to the Sahasrara, the seventh or crown chakra. Center your attention on your third eye and with your eyes closed looking up to the point between your eyes, open your heart, and as you go to God asking for your soul to be at one with His soul, allow His love to enter. Let go. Let God. Stay focused and release everything.

(Long pause for meditation)

When you feel the love of God coming into your soul where your heart chakra is and this light coming through your body, your physical body, your spiritual body, your soul, enjoy and be in Joy in the Love of God.

I am your brother and friend and I love you, I am Yogananda.
