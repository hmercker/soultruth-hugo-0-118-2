I am here Francis and I wish to comment on the guide of our dear brother and his wonderful influence on him, and his words. For isn’t what he is saying what we put our intention on, or as Luke said: *“Where the heart is therefore is your treasure?"* 

He could have said: *“Stay in your heart”* and he would have meant stay in your soul. In the prayer the Master gave was included words about the allurements and pleasures of this world. When you are living a life that is removed from the world in a monastery, in a temple, or as in my life we when we were out in nature, there is so much time for prayer and meditation and the simple life, Then there is going out into the world and staying in that communion, bringing the love to all. 

For it does no good to give if it is not in love, to speak if it is not in love, to walk if it is not done in love. You have been encouraged to pray. We are not asking for words with some kind of eloquence but for the longings of your soul to God for His Love. And for you to keep that connection whether you be in the world or removed. To take that in your walk in the world. They will know you in this way and you will do more to change their hearts, touch their souls, with love than any gifts you may bring, for God’s Love is the greatest gift. This kindness is a treasure. 

My dear brothers you indeed are loved, you indeed are watched over by many, guided by many. Know this in your hearts and do not allow yourselves to be distracted by negativity. Yes the world has its troubles. What is the solution? It is love, human love and God’s Love. I can only suggest that you bring this to the world with every breath. Do not trouble yourselves with your shortcomings for you are human. But allow yourselves to be lifted in this beautiful grace of God’s love. 

How we love you, how God loves you. I am your brother and friend in Christ, I am Francis. Go with God!
