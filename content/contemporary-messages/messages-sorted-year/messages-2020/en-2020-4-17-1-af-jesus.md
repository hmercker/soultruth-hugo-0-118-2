Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I come. I am Jesus. I wish to commend this beautiful instrument for his efforts to bring the Truth of the soul forward. This is not an easy subject for those of you who dwell in the earthly plane for so much is not of the soul. So much is the antithesis of the soul that brings a difficult condition from which to observe and understand the conditions, the existence of soul.

So, in my day when I spoke and taught of the soul, I spoke in allegories and stories to help my brothers and sisters relate to that which I spoke of. In this day and age, many of you desire specific and technical details of these things that are not of the material world. Your soul is the jewel of your being. It is that great gift of life and uniqueness that God has given to each one of you, beloved souls. It is that thing that motivates all of us within the Celestial Kingdom to come to this Earth plane and help nurture the awakening of your souls. It is that jewel that may multiply and expand and grow in magnificent proportions bringing forth the fruits of the soul expressed in all their beauty and glory and wonderment through the blessings of the Father’s Love.

So for each of you, this journey will be unique and powerfully transformative in your lives bringing to you such wealth of Truth, such great joy, such understanding and meaning into your lives that nothing will compare. Nothing will compare to the experience and life of the soul expressed in your life on Earth. Continue to nurture your souls through prayer, through beseeching God to transform and heal your soul with His Love. In this, all answers will be given, all gifts will awaken, all Truth will be evident.

Your souls have the capacity to embrace the universe of God’s Creation, to embrace at-onement with God. It is a journey of awakening. It is a journey of joy. It is a journey of transformation. May you find your way upon this path that God has set before you, showing you the way in Light and Grace, showing you with compassion and Love, showing you with a great desire that you understand, come to know God’s beautiful Self and God’s beautiful Creation.

These things are promised to you, beloved souls, provided you follow the path that leads to the redemption of the soul. These things are given to those who, through all earnestness and desire, wish to have what is offered. Seek and it shall be yours, beloveds. Come to be in the Grace of God and all the confusion and material concerns, fears and errors will melt in the Great River of God’s Love. It is my promise to you, and it is God’s Gift to you. It is the beginning of true awakening for each of you.

May God bless you on that journey. Know that I am with you, that I walk with you and shall always do so. I am your brother and your friend. I am Jesus and my love is with you always. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
