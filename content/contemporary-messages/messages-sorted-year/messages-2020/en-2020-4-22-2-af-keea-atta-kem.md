# The World Needs More Lightworkers

April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2020

West Vancouver Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Keea Atta Kem. I come to each of your Circles, as do many who are with us in the Celestial Heavens. We come because you pray and beseech God to bring Light to you and to this world. Such a simple but profound prayer brings the response of the angels to Earth. We seek to serve as you seek to serve, beloved souls. We seek to assist God in these blessings that come from His Great Soul to your souls, to your bodies, to your minds. All of you is being blessed at this time.

As you continue to pray and open yourselves to these blessings, so we continue to work diligently to help focus these blessings and energies towards you. This is all part of God's plan, this beautiful hierarchy of love where one assists the other, uplifts the other and the other, until all are uplifted in Light. All feel this Grace that pours forth from God and so your souls are touched with Love. Your hearts are opened with Love. Your bodies are blessed with Love and God's great Healing Touch upon you.

Beloved souls, know that we are with you always, that we make great efforts to assure that you are protected, uplifted, guided, inspired and blessed every time you send a thought towards God, every time you say a prayer. Every time you acknowledge that desire of your soul to be with God, so we are with you. We come close at these times because it is that longing of the soul that brings us close. It is the power of your own soulâ€™s desire that bring many, many blessings to you and to others.

As you are asked and you comply with this request to pray for your brothers and sisters, to be a channel of love for your brothers and sisters, so you come into alignment with this great hierarchy of Love, so you are blessed deeply. So, your lives continue upon this trajectory of soul awakening, this profound shift within you that will continue for all eternity.

Oh, how this world needs more like yourselves, more lightworkers, as you call them, more who are channels of Light and Love in the world. Oh, how your world is lost in darkness and is now turning towards light ever so slightly, day by day, it is turning towards light. You, beloved souls, will be used in many ways to help with this shift of the world towards all that which is in harmony with God's creation. God's plan includes you all, beloved souls. God's plan will guide you forward in many different ways, avenues, dimensions from which you may work for God and be a channel for God's Touch and Healing and Love for humanity.

Continue with your prayers. Continue to be His children, trusting in His Will, trusting in His plan. For as you trust and pray and seek more earnestly for the Truth, so these gifts and capacities of service and channels of love will awaken more fully and be a powerful agent in the world for the transformation that is meant to be and will be in times to come.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea Atta Kem and I am happy to be with you today in your prayers. My love is with you. My heart aches for your world and for the struggles that you all have. Yet, I see you continually come to drink of this fountainhead of Love, that you continue to desire to be uplifted, to be transformed and healed. This gives all of us great hope, great hope for the future. One flame lighting another and lighting another. This is the unfoldment of God's plan for the salvation of humanity and you are all a part of this great and wondrous plan and gift to bring light to your world. God bless you beloveds, God bless you.
