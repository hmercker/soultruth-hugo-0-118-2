# Embrace all in Love

I am here Francis, your brother and friend in the Grace of God. When I left my family home and began my walk in nature amongst the beauty of God’s Creation in harmony with His creatures big and small, I was so grateful for every flower and the delights of creation in the natural world. I was also following the longings in my soul to reach the Celestial realm. For my soul knew there was something beyond the Earth Plane in this Love of God that would carry us and transform us and lift us up. 

So we lived in harmony in the natural and the Divine. The human condition seeks harmony and peace brotherhood and sisterhood, equality and sustainability. These are beautiful aspirations and we pray that the Earth may be in this harmony as you do. Those of us in spirit and most especially those of us in the Celestial realms, knowing your future, we come to join you in your prayers to receive the great Love of the Creator that transforms the soul. You stand on this bridge between Heaven and Earth and Love connects both. There are the natural heavens, beautiful realms, beautiful realms of the purified soul and the Celestial heavens - beyond the words of the transformed soul, from the mortal to the Divine angel. 

May there be peace on Earth. May all here in this circle and beyond be in harmony without judgement because there is really only one path and that is Love. We come to embrace you on this path in the Grace of God. May each one be blessed in His love. I am your brother and friend in Christ,  I am Francis. Go with God.
