# Be Sincere in Your Prayers for the Gift of Healing

Healing Collection, Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you, I am Lotus Blossom. Dear beloved souls, how precious it is to see each one of you here.  To see the light that is in your soul and to see the desire of your soul coming to know God in this close and pure way. Acknowledge the workings of God through you and the blessings that God can bring through you for others. Each one is unique in their healing gifts and the way God will administer through your healing gift.

Each one of you has the potential to bring healing to the Earth and to be a channel of love and healing energies. As you stay close and walk with your Heavenly Father asking for the continuation of your soul to be blessed by His Love and your gift of healing to be developed and its instrumentality to be in service, your sincere prayers dear ones, God answers through the Law of Activation. Providing there is sincerity in your soul to be a channel of healing energies, so shall it be.

When a soul gift is developed by the Grace of God its purpose serves in the highest way. At this time, you may have a mindful understanding of the way God will use your gift and the way of its instrumentality. What I wish to say to you is the mind’s understanding and perspective is very limited. Your gift is being awakened at the level of the soul. Your gift is being developed in the way that God wills for it to be of service. This is a blessing, beloveds, all you need for your gift to be used in a very deep way God shall bring to you.

God will provide you an angel who is well-developed in the healing arts.  This angel desires to make a rapport with you for when you pray to be a channel of love and the Essence of Divine Love is flowing to you, you have the ability to draw forward the celestial angels.  We serve those who pray for Divine Love and your gift will be in service the way God wills.

There will be changes and developments as you move along. Each door that opens for you opens when you are ready at the level of soul development. As you know very well, your soul is developed by the Grace of God’s Love.

As we enter into this way of coming together, the celestial angels come into your midst bringing their gifts. Some of these celestials you are aware of and many you are not.  There are millions of celestial angels you are not aware of. There are many celestial angels who are gifted in the healing arts and shall come in service for your development. The celestials you are aware of that will walk forward shall be dear Seretta Kem, our beloved Kea, dear Confucius, myself, and even the Master Jesus. We all desire to serve God's Will.

You beloved souls, upon Earth, are required for us bring forward the healing energies to your Earth and to those individual souls who are in pain and suffering. There will be many opportunities that come your way in time. As you know, the workings of God are pure, are complete, and are full. All of this takes time but as you continue to dedicate to God in this way for your beloved gift of healing to be of service, so shall it be.

Many changes are coming to your Earth, beloveds. Know that through your gifts of healing, you will be an active agent for change. Your instrumentality is part of God's Will for healing to come to the Earth. We need you to work through. God needs you to work through.

I shall leave you today with these words of deep gratitude and for hearing the call of your soul and honouring your gift of healing and its development. God bless you as you enter into deep prayer. My love is with you. I am Lotus Blossom.
