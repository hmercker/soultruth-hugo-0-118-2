I am here, Yogananda.

I wish to add to the Master’s beautiful description of the soul in relationship to its Creator. I give the example of falling in love, human love. You’re willing to give your whole heart because you are so enamored. Then perhaps you find out that the object of your affection feels the same way. You thank God. You thank your lucky stars. You’re willing to jump out of your skin and you think you might saying *“Oh, what joy.”* You feel like your whole being is buzzing. 

This is the natural love, the human love, which extends to your parents, your families, your friends, your children, your animals and the love of Mother Earth. Then imagine, if you will, consider the Creator who gave you this potential of not only the joy and harmony of the human love fulfilled and, in these days<sup>1</sup>, by looking up and seeing the stars again, the galaxies, the water becoming clear, hearing the birds, and seeing animals in your backyard perhaps, along with our most Holy Creator giving His gift, offering the gift of Divine Love, the very Essence of the Creator to each one, transcending the human condition and yet embracing it. Imagine the Love of God that has given all these gifts and giving your heart to the Creator who will fill your heart, fill your soul with a Love that is eternal, that contains immortality in the very Essence of God. One love, however great, is fleeting. The other is everlasting. You will know and you do know the difference in the glory, in the Light, in the transformation of God’s Love.

Thank you. I am your brother and friend for all eternity. I am Yogananda. God bless you.
