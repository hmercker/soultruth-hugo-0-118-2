Mediumship Workshops, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. There are many ways that you may feel our presence. There are many signals and experiences that you will have as a unique soul in prayer and in rapport with us that will signal to you that we are indeed close. It is for you to discover these aspects of communication that are unique to you but also not unique in as much as many share a similarity in the experience.

When we are close, we bring a measure of God’s Love with us. In this rapport that we endeavour to create between ourselves and you, it is often a common experience that the individual will feel a warmth, a sense of this Love, an expansion within their own energy field. This is a good indication that we are close. For some of you who are sensitive enough and gifted enough and developed enough in your gifts, we may have communication. You may have thoughts and even verbal communication come into your consciousness with the awareness that it does not originate from you. This is ideal, for with this openness of communication and with you being aware that we are present, we may have a good dialogue. We may indeed bring some important information, some inspiration and truth to you.

We may step further with this communication by utilising your gifts of mediumship and bringing through this information to others through the ways and means that are available to us such as what I am doing at this moment or through writing or through visualisations. There are many ways that we might communicate with you and through you. It is for you to discover those gifts. I assure all of you that you do have the gifts and possibilities for these forms of communication to some degree or another. Some are highly gifted. Others have a rudimentary capacity.

As you receive the blessing of God’s Love, so these capacities and gifts will expand and be developed and become a natural outcome of your soulful awakening through God’s Love. It is a journey, my beloved and beautiful friends, a journey that is often surprising, that often brings to you gifts and experiences unbidden and unanticipated. It is for you to be patient, to be open and receptive, to long for the gift of God’s Love to inform all that opens and unfolds in your experience with these higher Truths and realities for you may indeed experience these things.

God wishes for you to know these things, to experience the closeness of His Touch upon you and the closeness of His Angels’ touch upon you. So I assure you and I encourage you to continue upon that journey of awakening, of seeking through your souls awakened by God’s Touch of Love these channels of communication, these Portals of Light that will come to each of you. In this, much will flow. A great deal will come from God to your soul. We will be close. We will come to reinforce, to encourage, to inspire, to teach, and to bless each one of you. It is important that many in your world come to know the world of spirit and the higher teachings of God.

In this way, you become equipped to help usher in the changes that are coming in this world of yours, those changes that will bring a higher consciousness, a higher understanding, a greater understanding of Truth, of knowledge and to utilise these things for the benefit and upliftment of humanity. There is much that can be shared with humanity that will improve the lot of all upon your world, but first a foundation of wisdom, of love, of desire for the highest, desire for the benefit of all rather than the benefit of just a few. These things are important, this desire, this foundation must be laid within you and within all in your world.

We work diligently to help lay these foundations and we ask you, beloved souls, to assist us, to assist God in this unfolding of a great plan to bring greater Light, greater Truth, and greater Love to your world. May God bless you upon that journey. You are each along that path that continues to unfold before you, that continues to be blessed by God, that continues to have the accompaniment of the angels.

May God bless you, beloved souls. We are with you. Be assured. Open your eyes and your ears. Open your minds and your hearts. Open yourselves to the greater Touch of God and His Angels in your lives. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. God bless you.
