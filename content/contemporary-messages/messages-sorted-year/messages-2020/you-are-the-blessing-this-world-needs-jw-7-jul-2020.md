# You are the Blessing this World Needs 

July 7<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your sister and friend in the love of God, I am Eileen Caddy. When you go into silence, whether you hear the still small voice of God, or the Angels, what is important is that you make a rapport in Divine Love. 

I did teach going within but if you read between the lines of what I wrote and the messages that I received of the *“infilling and inflowing of God’s Love”,* it is apparent that one can go within to that quiet place of the soul, that wonderful gift of God to each being, and then open to Love. 

However your heart sends out this request, whether with words or just in the deep longings from your souls, this intention connects you with the soul of God, who never refuses to bless His children with His great and glorious gift, as in this beautiful circle of light and love.

In these troubled times each one of you is given a great inflowing of this gift that you may take it into the world and bless each one. When confronted with something that is less than love; negativity, vexations, go to your heart. Make that connection in your soul, and ask God to bless this soul, those people, that place. Wherever you may be bless all, for you carry this gift in your hearts and souls. You are the blessing this world needs in God’s love. 

I am with you. All my love and blessings in the Grace of God where we are One. I am Eileen. God bless you.
