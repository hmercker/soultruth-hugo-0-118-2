Andrew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Andrew. Each of your souls is blooming in love and light. Remember to make God the cornerstone of your life, to set your day in prayer to receive this gift of His Love for this is what will determine the pacing and extent of your day as you continue to live in your world, a world that can indeed pull you this way and that, can influence your thoughts, your deeds, your sense of self, and sense of the world. But, when you have God as your foundation receiving his great gift of Divine Love, all of these things that are in the world, in your lives, take on a different perspective.

In this way you walk with your feet firmly upon the Divine Path. In this way, Love pours abundantly through you and around you. There is joy. There is peace. There is a powerful perspective that is not all from this world but gives a sense of what this world is meant to be. Love will clear away the obstacles. The wisdom of your soul will give you the insight that you need to deal with the dilemmas and problems of your life. Joy, beloveds, deep joy will be your perspective, your vision of life and of yourselves, recognising the great gift the God has given you which is your life.

Your unique soul, your unique experiences, your unique expressions and gifts, all these things blossoming in love, bringing to you a clarity of vision, a power to see beyond the illusions to truth, to be a channel of love in the world, and a closeness to God that will draw to you many souls in need of comfort and love. Love will flow as you continue to pray and be in the Light of God's Presence.

May God bless you upon this path, beloved souls. I am Andrew. My love is with you. Your love will continue to flourish and bless many as you become Godâ€™s instruments, channels of love in the world. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you deeply. We are with you. God is with you. You are with one another. Is this not something worth rejoicing and a sense of peace, of fullness in your heart and joy? God bless you.
