How well secured you are in your lives. Safe, warm, you want for nothing, beloved souls. Though you may feel that you wish for more, in truth, God is looking after you. Every step, every breath you take, God’s Hand is upon you. There is no need for want. There is no need to desire more of the material for are you not well-fed, clothed, warm and secure? So many in your world would envy all the comforts that you have and your life here in this beautiful place. How blessed you are, and you will continue to be blessed, protected, nurtured and provided for. None will go hungry or want for the basic necessities of life. You are secured and you are protected. 

So with this is mind, is it not important that you spend time in prayer; that these worries and wants are not what you need expend your time and resources upon. Rather what is required is prayer, a deep desire to be with God, a deep desire within your soul to receive His Love, to know His Love deeply, to have that hungering place within you filled with the blessings of His Essence warming your soul, building a Light, the wisdom and the Truth within you. I urge you beloved souls, to continue to spend as much time as you can in prayer for each of you needs to be strong in the Love of God. Each of you have things to do in this world and you must be strong in order to do those things that God wishes of you. 

That strength comes through prayer, through truly being in alignment with God. That alignment is a conscious, powerful part of yourselves and your conscious life. It is important to pray for this gift of Love, to pray for God’s Touch upon you, to pray that you may be blessed with healing and peace, wisdom and love. Without these things predominantly influencing your lives, you are vulnerable, as most are in your world vulnerable, to the conditions and changes and upheavals of your world. With the Light of God’s Love within you burning bright, you will have the strength and the capacity and the protection that will afford you the opportunity to serve your brothers and sisters in many different ways, in capacities that are yet unfathomed and known within you. 

There is much that needs and requires and desires to come forth within you. So it is for you to spend time each day seeking out those parts within you that are longing to be recognized and expressed in your life. Yes there is much within you, and a deep desire to continue on in your soul’s progression, to indeed uncover the great mysteries of your own soul and the mysteries of God’s Great Soul. These things come and will continue to unfold in harmony, in the timing that is in harmony and with the awakening that comes ever so slowly but surely within your lives. As that Light grows within you, as you express that Light within your soul, so many will be touched and many around you will know a comfort and a strength and the love that emanates from each one of you. 

This great blessing is not just for you, but will indeed be expressed in many different ways and facets and beautiful unfoldments of your soul. So that you may indeed affect, influence, inspire and benefit many other souls in your world, those close to you and those who you do not know, but God will use you to touch many. Be strong in this Light of Love. Be committed daily to your prayers. Be disciplined in your minds so that you may express yourselves in Light, in Truth and in Love. Much awaits. God awaits your efforts, the expression of your soul’s true desires expressed in prayer, unfolding in Love.

May God bless you upon that journey, my friends. I am Andrew. My love is with you. I am with you so very often. I see your Lights. I see the journey that you take. I understand those challenges that may impede your journey. But still what brings me joy is to see that you walk, step by step, forward in faith and love, in strength and Light. How beautiful you are, beloved souls, how beautiful indeed. May God’s blessings continue to bring greater beauty and Light to you all. 

God bless you. I am Andrew and I love you. God bless you.
