# This will be your Treasure

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your sister in Christ, Clare of Assisi. I am here to also honor my beloved Francis. He was our inspiration and mentor, and to this day, many brothers and sisters have taken up the journey upon the path of poverty, prayer, charity, kindness to all, and peace. 

What we realized back then was what you call, the saying is, “you can’t take it with you.” This was our realization that if we were to pass over into spirit, what in fact, could we take with us? You take your soul and its condition. Though you cannot take your material goods whether you be wealthy or poor, you can take the riches of Divine love, a wealth beyond measure. You have chosen rightly this path to be open to God’s love and the great riches that are bestowed on each one. I tell you this will be your treasure.

These prayers will be the stars in your heavenly crown, each one. This love, this endless love of God that you have discovered, will never be lost and this you will take with you. So let us celebrate this wonderful community coming together in holy communion in the grace of God, and it riches. As you honor my beloved Francis, he and all here honor you. Go in the grace of God.

I love you. I am Clare of Assisi.

**Note** This was an online DLS prayer circle honoring Francis of Assisi
