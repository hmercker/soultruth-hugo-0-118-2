Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, it is Seretta Kem. Yes, many doors are opening at this time for all of you. Like this instrument, each of you will have experiences, opportunities, revelations, openings that will enhance your spiritual life and spiritual service. Many will be drawn to you now, beloved souls. The power of God's Love that continues to flow within and about you in your lives, affecting everything, will elicit a great deal of response and interest from many souls.

You step closer into your purpose. God is orchestrating many things that will allow you to see more clearly and be guided more directly upon your path and efforts to serve. Those opportunities that God will lay before you will be quite compelling and at times surprising. Yet God does not lay before you challenges and opportunities that are beyond your abilities or contrary to your soul’s desires.

So you will find yourselves assessing and contemplating your next steps upon this path, but I assure you that they will be clear; clearly set forth, clearly given as an invitation to go beyond those conditions and habits and patterns of your life that are somewhat mundane and be more fully involved in the service and experiences and relationships that are being forged through your prayers and efforts with many seeking souls.

How this will unfold will be surprising to you. It will not be of your own making or planning but will come fully formed as a gift from God. You will be able to see and understand what will be laid before you as an invitation to serve God and his great plan for the salvation of humanity. Oh, there are times when you may hesitate as that human part of you, your mindful reckonings, will often disagree with what your soul already knows and is an alignment with, but these minor discretions will not hold you from your destiny and purpose. Each day will bring different insights and greater joy. Each day will bring many opportunities to serve your brothers and sisters. Each day will bring greater blessings to all of you.

Though the conditions of the world will intensify bringing new challenges, new difficulties into your lives and into the lives of all on this world, you will find yourself in great joy and anticipation of what is coming and what is manifesting all around you. You will find yourselves caught in the flow of God’s Will, this mighty river carrying you. Its pace and flow quickening as the unfolding of His plan awakens many aspects and situations in need of your presence and service to assist your brothers and sisters, to clarify many things, to comfort and uplift and uphold those who are confused and sometimes frightened and disillusioned and fearful.

Through these conditions, you will be the one who clarifies, be the instrument that dissipates the darkness and the human conditions which will impinge upon each of you to some degree. This is where you must carry yourselves in faith and trust in God's Will in alignment with God, deepening your prayers, being strengthened by all that is in the realms of God, and accepting that you are drawn closer into the great reality of God and further from the conditions of this world.

Change is coming for you all, most of all a deep change within you where the workings and inclinations of your mind drawn into the human condition will not be so prevalent. These struggles that have been with you all of your lives will be greatly diminished in these times to come which are upon us now. Be joyed, beloved souls, and all that God presents to you has great opportunities, great blessings, experiences of the soul awakening to God.

You have put the key into the door. You have turned this key and the door is now opening, bringing with this opening a great flow of light, of intentions from God and awakenings of the soul, strengthening in faith and truth and knowledge, guided with each day, free from those many burdens which a mindful existence often imposes upon a soul. Great cracks are showing up around your soul loosening the encrustations, the barriers, the temptations that lead you away from light and away from God, strengthening, beloved souls, strengthening your very being, awakening the hidden treasures of your soul, blossoming in the great joy of God’s Love.

You are finding your freedom. In this, you will choose service and be dedicated to the upliftment of your brothers and sisters for with this service and dedication and you will bring greater joy, extraordinary joy, to your being as God’s Hands rest upon you all. So we continue to grow in His Love, to be clear and beautiful channels of His Will and Light and Love. Now is the time to open yourselves completely to God and to allow the beauty, the power, the glory, the miraculous awakening of your soul to come in full measure and be a true and beautiful expression of your being.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. I am with you upon this journey. I take great joy, I feel such love for you all to see how you continue to strive ahead, to walk forward into light, to trust in the guidance and Will of God as he continues to light your path. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you deeply, fully, powerfully in His Love.
