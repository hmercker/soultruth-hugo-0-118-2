# Celebration of Progress for the University of the Soul (Lightbringers)

November 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Lightbringers, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloveds, I am Professor Salyards. What a great lesson it is to see how God will bring individual souls together to create something of light in your world and that God has selected each of you. God has put within each of you great gifts and abilities that may come together and form a complete whole of expression, creativity, understanding and truth that will be a powerful engine to bring about this effort to show humanity the higher road towards light, the truth of love, the facility of knowing God through one's own soul, these things that are required for humanity to be uplifted. God is working with many in your world to help uplift humanity, to help educate, to inspire, to show the way. And so your experiences, your understanding of truth, your gifts of the soul and the mind all contribute to creating a powerful force for good in the world.

Know that within each one of you have what is required, contain the answers that you seek and have great insights and creative capacities to bring about this wondrous formulation to open the avenue of Truth to humanity, to this world of yours. And know that for each one of you there are numerous angels that are working with you to help you come to these realizations and expressions so that all may fall into place with an intricacy, a delicacy, a subtlety, and the power that will bring others forward, inspire them to step forward and join you in this great movement towards Truth, towards Love, towards Light. You are setting an example as you work together and you do so in harmony and love, appreciation and respect. And this will bring about quick results. You will come to know the purpose, the whys and the wherefores, as our dear brother asks for, quickly they will come, in an instant, provided you are open within your mind, within your prayers, within your efforts together to glean the truth of the matter. Much is available to you, many resources are available to you from our side of life. And indeed, this is a collaboration and you may not worry that you will stumble and miss the direction in which you are meant to go. For I see this as almost impossible, you would have to willingly decide to take a different route in order to divert your efforts and direction for the power of your soulsâ€™ lights, the beauty of your mindful considerations, the intentions that are deep within you all conspire to bring you along the path that is intended. And God will indeed guide us all in this great effort. As I have said and others have said, consider the timing of these things. There are times when one must stop and consider and times when one must act and express what is required to bring the fruition of the intention.

You will all be guided, beloved souls. Do you not feel within you an excitement, a sense that there is a purpose here, that God has placed before you a great opportunity, and that He has done so in the timing that indicates that you are ripe for this venture, that you are prepared, that each of you have had particular life experiences that have prepared you for this. You have within you certain gifts and capacities and abilities that will contribute greatly to these efforts. And that the world at this time is in great need of these things and you will see as time progresses, as the doors open, that there will be many opportunities to speak, to share, to gather, to teach, and to inspire many souls who are seeking those things that you have and are able to express in light and love. Your souls are dancing in joy and we in the Celestial kingdom are celebrating your great efforts together, your acceptance of God's Will, this unfolding journey of service and love.

May God continue to bless you with greater awakening, with greater capacity and understanding of Truth with a soul that resonates with love, expresses love, and is motivated by love. God bless you, beloved friends, your Professor Salyards continues to work with you and oversee these great efforts. God bless you, beloved, beloved friends. God bless you.
