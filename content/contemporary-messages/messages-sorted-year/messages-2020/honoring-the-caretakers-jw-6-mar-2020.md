Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your brother Francis. I am humbled by this group of caretakers. Many in the world cannot comprehend the challenges of caring for others who are not able to care for themselves. Those here who have been of service for so many years have faced the triumphs and the tribulations and all the challenges of being caretakers. 

But when things seem insurmountable God intervenes and there’s always a way forward. It can be quite a tumultuous ride and it can challenge the very foundations of your faith and yet I see none of you would have chosen differently because in your hearts there is such love and such a deep desire to be of service. Service purifies one’s soul and when you add the love of God you see a glory, a joy, a light, added to each life. The giver receives more than the recipient in this case because the reward is in the giving. 

You are all recipients of the great love of our Heavenly Father. When you give service in His love, you are giving the greatest gift one human can give another. I wish to acknowledge this in this circle of light that you may know you are deeply appreciated in every way, seen and unseen. Let your hearts be full that God may fill your souls. I say to you the rewards for your service are still yet to come in glory but today we acknowledge you embrace you. As we are all grateful for God’s love we too are grateful for your service. You have provided a wonderful blessing to those you serve. 

So, with all my love and the gratitude of those here who watch over you. May God bless you protect you transform you in His love. I am your brother and friend Francis. God bless you.
