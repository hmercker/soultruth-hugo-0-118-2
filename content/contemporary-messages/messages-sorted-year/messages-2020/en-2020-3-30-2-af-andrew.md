Gibsons Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Andrew received by Al Fike

May God’s blessings be upon you, beloved souls. I am Andrew. God will gather you again and again in these Circles of Light, seeking to nourish your souls, assisting you upon that journey towards at-onement, inspiring you to seek deeper and further into the realms of your own souls, into the realms of God’s existence. God will carry you forth upon beams of light, resplendent in gold and colors, anointing your soul and bodies, bringing peace to your minds, bringing awareness to those long-hidden faculties of the soul. God will bring you to the Fountainhead of all Love, beckoning you to drink, to drink until you thirst no longer. Yet, within your soul is a never sated longing for this gift, this blessing of Love.

There is nothing of this world that will hold you from God. There is only the Light and healing and deep Love that God has for each one of you that will continue to bless you and uphold you, beloved souls. You are in God’s Grace at this moment. We are with you at this moment. Know the great blessing of the Father’s Hand upon you, His Love entering your soul, its blessing changing you forever.

May God bless you and keep you in this Light. May you come to know God’s Love as a real and enduring part of your life, your very being. Awaken to all that is of Light and Truth and Love. Awaken and be counted by God as one of His beloved children. He gathers you thus, into the folds of His Arms and shall protect you forever from all that is not of Light. Blessed are the children. Blessed are you, beloved souls. Be in His Grace and be guided wherever you go.

God bless you. I have deep love for each one of you. I am Andrew and I am with you often. For my work is to uplift all souls of this Earth, all souls in darkness, all souls that long for Light. I am an angel residing in the Celestial spheres and as such, my desire and my work is to bring all to the Truth of God’s Love. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you deeply in Love.
