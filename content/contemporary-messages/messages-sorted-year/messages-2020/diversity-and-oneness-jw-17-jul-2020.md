I am here in the Grace of God, Thomas Merton. I am drawn to this circle by its diversity and its oneness. You who come from different cultures, regions on the earth find there is oneness in your longing to receive God’s Love. This too, this oneness is something that I aspire to. To unify all. I knew in my soul there was only one Creator but many prophets. Of course as a Christian I believed in the divinity of Jesus, and that he is the divine soul. 

But I explored many traditions and even Buddhism which I loved the freedom of and the peace of meditation that could come from that path. And yet my soul longed for something to connect me. I had a favorite meditation that I learned from the writings of an orthodox monk whose meditation was called “Prayer for the Presence of God,” because this is what I longed for. On the one hand I was fascinated by all the literature and words and concepts and I believed myself to all of them and I would not deprive anyone from seeking. And yet, the bravest of all these searches as you have discovered and I have discovered, is to be in prayer to receive the Love of God. 

This circle of light attracts so many Celestial beings, who wish to be in prayer with all of you who wish to inspire and influence you while respecting your free will. Above all, to be at one with you as we are one in the Love of God. Beyond the words, beyond the teachings there is the simple presence and grace of God’s Love. May it be upon you all. 

I thank you for allowing me this time and I am honored to be here, it is my privilege. May you all be blessed with love, the love for each other and in the Love of God. I am Thomas Merton, God bless you.
