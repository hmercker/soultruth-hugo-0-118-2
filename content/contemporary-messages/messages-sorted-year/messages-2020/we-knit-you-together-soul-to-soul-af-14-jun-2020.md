# We Knit You Together Soul to Soul

June 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike



We continue to knit you together soul to soul. As you persist with your efforts in prayer together, so you open doorways and possibilities that will bring greater awareness and facilitate the unfolding of your gifts. Thus you may know the Truth of God’s Creation, the Truth of your own potentials, and you may be able to communicate with one another in deeper ways and share these experiences together in a wider spectrum of conscious awareness and experience. 

Much can be done even in this rather unique situation for we do indeed draw you together soul to soul. Because of the efforts of the angels and the blessings of God, so you are bonded, deeply, beautifully and are able to be used as God’s channels to support one another and to be used as a channel of light and love in the world. These gifts can only grow as you continue to pray together. As you pray singly, so you are reaching soul to soul to your brothers and sisters as each one prays. As each one continues to strive to be uplifted and in the Light, so you carry you carry your brothers and sisters with you, so you are a link in a chain that is strong and will uphold all that you love in this great Circle of Light.

If you could see the possibilities and the depth of these Circles from our perspective, if you could see the power of Love continuing to awaken the many possibilities of your gifts and of being together in this way, it would bring you great joy, my beloved friends. For as you are drawn here, it is because your souls recognise the power of prayer, the power of Love and the power of God who draws you together. You will find yourself drinking from this well over and over again. You will find through your prayer and your desires drawing those close to you, not only in spirit but those of you who are here today in the flesh, bonding together, brother to sister, sister to brother, strengthening this chain of Light that shall be your anchor and your strength in times to come.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. We all continue to work with you, not only for your benefits but for the benefit of the world. It is a mighty and noble task, one that is blessed by God, one that shall continue to grow and expand in depth and breath, in Light and Love for the benefit of all. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with you.
