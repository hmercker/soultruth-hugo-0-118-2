# Clarification of the Message on the Gathering of the Tribes

April 21<sup>st</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Punalu'u, Oahu, HI, USA

White Eagle received by Jimbeau Walsh

My brothers and sisters, I am come as a disciple of the Master. I wish to clarify [my message on the gathering of the tribes](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2020/the-only-tribe-jw-19-apr-2020/). I told you there is truly one tribe, God’s children, one race, the human race, one God, one path of Love. Some wondered and thought well, these are beautiful words. There’s so much Truth but when we look out in the world, we see more division than ever, violence and anger, political disruptions, religious factions, war, hunger. How can this be if we are all one?

I wish to clarify that first of all, I was speaking to the Circle of Light around the world that prays for God’s Love and feels that oneness and knows it in their souls that what I spoke was true. Yes, those who have not discovered this great Truth, who seek to belong, who are fearful even, most especially in times of crisis, may gravitate to the tribe of ethnicity, the tribe of race, the tribe of country, the tribe of religion, the tribe of sports, the tribe of money, and so on.

You know, of course, that these paths do not transform the soul. They are a temporary solace for many. For some, they are a way of lashing out. So for you, my brothers and sisters in God’s Love, in this medicine circle, this tribe of Divine Love, I ask that you embrace all those who have not discovered this with the Love in your souls, with the song in your hearts, with the drum of life, eternal life, that you may lead them all into the Circle of Light and Love which we are all so blessed to be in.

Yes, there is one tribe and one path, though this path of love has two sides, the natural love and God’s Love, the Divine Love. Though your soul knows the distinction, we ask that you not judge, that you may bring all into the circle to be blessed with Love. Bang the drum of eternal life. Let it shine through each of your souls. Bring this medicine to the world because you can.

Thank you for allowing me to come again. I hope I have shed some light on the gathering of the tribes in God’s Love. May each one be blessed and changed. God bless you, my brothers and my sisters. I am White Eagle.
