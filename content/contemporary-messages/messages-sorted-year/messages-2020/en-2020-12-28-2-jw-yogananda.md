# Freeing yourself of Baggage

Online Prayer Circles, Punalu'u, Oahu, HI, USA

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here Yogananda.  I come to join you in this prayer, in this opening of your hearts to receive the gift of the Creator’s love.

When you take a journey, you may bring things with you. Things you consider necessities, and so you have baggage. On this journey and during your travels, you may discard some of these things as unnecessary and you may pick up other things that are more appropriate to wherever your travels may lead you. That is life on earth. The journey of the soul also brings with it, encrustations, accumulations, protections and many, many things. This baggage most souls take with them into spirit, where eventually, be it a long or short time, the soul is purified in the natural love, becoming a bright and beautiful soul without baggage, without encrustations, without wounds. On your journey to at-one-ment with the Creator, not only are these things let go, but the soul is transformed. This is not to say the soul is obliterated, or the uniqueness of an individual is lost, but transformed in love. This is why when we come you can feel us, you can sense our personalities, as you would say, and we speak to you from our souls, and through this one, through his soul. In the Celestial realm there is the mind of soul and there is a spirit body also transformed.

I wish to tell you that when you feel this glow of love, even when you feel it simply as an energy field around you, you can call this your astral body, but it surrounds you and is your sprit body, which will accompany your soul on its journey to the Kingdom of God and the Celestial heavens, where its appearance is hard to describe. As you may know you can alter that, we can alter how we appear, to make sure if we are appearing to one on earth, they are comfortable and they recognize us and they are seeing us with an open eye (third eye), with an open heart, with an open soul, beyond the physical body. I would encourage you to be aware of the energy around you and if you feel threatened to ask for protection that there may be a bubble of light and love protecting you. In this way you cannot be removed from being in the love of God. You will feel the embrace as you do in the circle, the glow in the solar plexus in the heart. Allow this Joy to overwhelm you, for what have you got to lose?  Surely you have the love of God to gain.

We here, who come and guide you and speak to you and join you on your journey, we spend a certain amount of time hoping that you will regard us and ask for our guidance and protection, because it is always given. To the extent your soul can be opened in the love of God this indicates the level of vibration that you will put out into the world, into the universe. As the master said *”Love your enemies”*. For love conquers all, and we love you and how God loves you is magnificent. I thank you for allowing me to come and I now join you in silence and in His love. May God bless you my dear brothers and sisters, beloved children of God.
