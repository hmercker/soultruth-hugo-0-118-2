# God is Knitting You All Together

February 18<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. God is knitting you all together. This great string of Light that has come from you, your souls in prayer to God, in prayers together, in efforts of unity and desire to receive the gift of His Love, the gift of Light and healing and peace. God is knitting you all together so that you may be a united force in this world for good and for Light, that you may be utilised by God and His angels to bring about an opening, a great opening of Light and influence upon your world.

So God continues to gather you together. God continues to encourage each and every one of you to be in communion with His Great Soul, that great Source of Love and Light that empowers all of these threads that are gathered amongst you and brought together with such fine intricacy so that you are all in harmony together. This is the work of the angels that continues to draw one to another to another, creating exquisite patterns of Light in your world, patterns that reach out to others, those who are connected to you, those in the world who are longing at this very moment from their souls for Light and blessings.

So you are being used beloved souls, to bring these blessings forth, utilising this network of Light, these beautiful webs that are created in Love, gifted to the world through your prayers and efforts. Know that each and every one who is within this beautiful, exquisite web is being blessed at this moment. Each of you continues to grow in this Love and be touched by the Heavenly Father whose Love pours endlessly upon you all.

Know that your prayers are being answered. Know that those needs that you have within your soul continue to go forth to God and to be recognised by God who sends the angels forth to do His work. Great channels of Love are being built by your prayers and our efforts and God’s blessing. Many more channels will be built around the world. Great channels for Light, for healing, to bring peace and to bring change. For your entire world needs to be healed, to be brought into harmony and balance.

So, this will be part of God’s plan to bring about that which is needed so that harmony and love may flourish and be a true expression of God’s intention for all in this world, for His Creation, which is meant to be in Light and harmony. Each of you play a part as each of you, through your prayers, and as you continue to contemplate and come to understand these Truths of God’s great Love for you all and God’s Creation that is so vast and intricate and wondrous.

You continue to inch closer to all that is within God’s Universe and God’s Will. So you will find your way. So you will know your way and understand and feel deeply that you are a part of God’s great plan and a part of God’s Great Love for you all. Much will come in the times ahead. Many blessings for you all, but also many challenges. For your world continues to be in disharmony and in need of great healing. God has a plan that will bring humanity forward in Light, to a place of recognition of their true natures, of their true purpose upon this world, of all that is within harmony of God’s Laws of Creation, which you are all within and a part of.

May God bless you on that journey, precious souls, precious souls indeed. You are deeply loved. God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine and I continue to assist you upon your journeys and at times, teach you and encourage you upon your quest for Truth and Love. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
