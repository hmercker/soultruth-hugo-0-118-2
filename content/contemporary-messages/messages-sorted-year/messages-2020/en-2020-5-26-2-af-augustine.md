# Your Souls Have Led You to this Circle

May 26<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. You have each found your way to this Circle, not by happenstance, but because your souls have found their way to this fellowship, this great effort to bring Light to the world and bring Light to your own souls. So, through your soul that has a deep desire to be awakened by God's Love, you are engaging in a great effort in your world, to bring Light, to bring blessings and conditions forth for the benefit of your brothers and sisters. So, we come from the Celestial Heavens, many of us, many angels come into your midst, praying with you, helping to guide you, working with you so that you may be utilized to benefit many in your world.

God uses the willing soul, my beloved and beautiful friends. God uses those who are gifted and who yearn for their gifts to be awakened by the deep Touch of God's Love. In this beautiful opening and journey towards God, so many blessings flow through you, flow into this world that is contrary to God's Laws and blessings in so many ways. You become part of the solution to heal humanity of their error, their pain, all the misfortunes that humanity creates for itself in your world by not being in harmony with God’s Laws, by not seeing love as the antidote to darkness. But you, my beautiful friends, have found this antidote, this way to eliminate, to heal, to dissipate, to bring into harmony those aspects within you, those thoughts, earthly conditions, encrustations of the soul that are with each who reside upon your planet, to bring them to Light, to allow these things made of man to be healed by the Hand of God.

So, in times to come, as you continue upon this journey, strengthening your channels, your gifts, your light and your beauty, you will be used more intensely by God as His instruments, His channels in the world. This you know within your soul to be true.

This is one reason why you have been drawn. Because deep within you is the understanding that you are willing to commit yourself in service, in love for humanity. This understanding will grow and become a conscious part of you. You will see what your purpose is in this world and how you may express it and how you may come to that place of clarity, a powerful flow of love and giving and expression that will be a reflection of your beautiful soul, so filled with so many gifts, so much you have to offer to others as God's instruments. In this understanding and this expansion of your beautiful soul in God's Love, so you will also know and feel a deep sense of humility and joy. You will be authentic, as you call it, in your world. True to yourself, true to the Truth that you know, true to your purpose and capacities to give to your brothers and sisters. This powerful example, this authenticity of the soul will be a beautiful and powerful channel of Light for the world.

You just begin, beloved souls. A flicker of understanding, a sense of the power of God's Love, a rudimentary perception of your own true self and a beginning of this journey that will lead to many, many opportunities, situations and opening doors so that you may serve in your world as channels of love.

We are with you, my beloved and beautiful friends. We see your Light. We come to inspire, to uplift, to teach, to inform you and guide you. For, we too are God’s instruments. We too desire to assist our brothers and sisters. So, the flow of Light and Love and Truth will continue through us all as we become in greater harmony, as we are fulfilled in God's Love, as we seek to unfold our great and beautiful souls and all that is within, within the Truth of God’s Love. His Will will manifest through us, depending upon your commitment, your efforts, your desire to honor your own soul, your own creation and He who has created you.

These beautiful awakenings and knowings of the deeper parts of yourself and the deeper realities of life and of God, will continue to unfold and unfold and unfold for this is an eternal awakening and growing in Love. Your souls will be blessed again and again. Your understanding will grow daily. The ways in which you may serve God will come in inspiration, will be awakened with your prayers and your desires to serve.  So, the journey just begins and that journey is for all eternity, beloved souls.

May you find the keys that will unlock all the possibilities of your soul. God's love is the door, your will will bring this key to unlock it. Your soul, the Light of your soul, will flow through this unlocked door and into the world.

May God bless you in this beautiful awakening and discovery. You are loved dearly, loved deeply, loved fully. May God bless you and may you come to know this truly for you are God's beautiful creation; beautiful, magnificent and full of many wonders. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine and I walk with you upon this journey of discovery and awakening. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
