I am here Gandhi.

Namaste! I salute and recognize the Divine Love in your souls. As you may know I brought a message of non-violence, ahimsa, to my country where there was much violence and a great longing to be free from the yoke of colonialism. This message, this gospel of peace, has been a part of the teachings in India from ancient times, from the Jains and through Hinduism and all of the various sects there has been a call for peace and non- violence. 

And yet in the world we see the followers of all these religions caught up in acts of revenge against injustice. I was very much involved in wanting social justice in my country but not through violence. Each one of you can see as you look through your lives that violence, and war and revenge has solved nothing. When I said *‘an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind’*, I was drawing this from the great wisdom of master Jesus and his beautiful sermon on loving your enemies. And yet I saw even his followers bereft of keeping this in their souls. 

As you view all of the injustice in your world you may feel this anger, and it is a righteous anger in your hearts and your souls, but I ask you to pray for the Love of God that brings *the peace that passes understanding.* The gift you can give to this world is to love each one as God loves you with this Divine love in your souls and create the change with love. We created a nation in this spirit of love. You who have been blessed in your souls with the light and the presence and the joy and the healing of God’s love, we encourage you to bring this gift to the world. Bring this peace, bring this joy and yes, make change. May the love of God be with you all. May the peace and the joy of His grace be with each of you. 

With all my love and blessings, I am your brother and friend in God’s love, I am Gandhi.
