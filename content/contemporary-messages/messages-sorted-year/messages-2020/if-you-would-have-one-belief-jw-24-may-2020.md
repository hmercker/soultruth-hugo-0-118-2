I am here Thomas Merton. I am your brother in God’s Love. I walked the path of love while on earth because I had discovered the one thing in God’s Universe that was truly important and necessary and believe me, I had baggage.

Imagine if the religions of the world were as tenacious about clinging to the Love of God and the brotherhood and sisterhood of humans as they are to their individual beliefs that have caused so much grief. Imagine as the song goes *‘no religion too’* (referring to a John Lennon song *“Imagine.”*) This is a difficult pill to swallow because religion has also done much good. On the human plane of charity, alleviating poverty and all these things in human love and the belief in God and kindness towards your neighbor. Yes, these are truly good things. 

I wish to tell you the stubbornness of the beliefs that say I am right and you are wrong, or this one is God this one is not, these will prove worthless to your souls. The mind is a curious thing. For I studied the Buddhists and the Sufi poets and the saints of Hinduism and the prophets of old and you know there was one factor one common denominator of all the great ones - God’s Love. 

Beyond the beliefs, beyond the orthodoxy, that clinging to the rock of God’s Love. If you would have one belief that will carry you across the threshold to the shores of the Celestial heavens believe in God’s Love with all your heart and from the depths of your souls. Let it be your prayer. 

Thank you for allowing me this time with you. May the blessings of God’s love change you each one of your beautiful souls. All my love and blessings in the Heavenly Father’s love. I am indeed your brother Thomas Merton

**NOTE:** Thomas Merton OCSO (January 31, 1915 – December 10, 1968) was an American Trappist monk, writer, theologian, mystic, poet, social activist, and scholar of comparative religion. On May 26, 1949, he was ordained to the priesthood and given the name *"Father Louis".* He was a member of the Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani, near Bardstown, Kentucky, living there from 1941 to his death.

Merton wrote more than 50 books in a period of 27 years, mostly on spirituality, social justice and a quiet pacifism, as well as scores of essays and reviews. Among Merton's most enduring works is his bestselling autobiography The Seven Storey Mountain (1948). His account of his spiritual journey inspired scores of World War II veterans, students, and teenagers to explore offerings of monasteries across the US. It is among National Review's list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century.
