# Welcome Greeting to Mediumship Group

April 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020

General Collection, Swakopmund, Namibia

James received by Helge Mercker

*It was our siesta time which is very peaceful and quiet (esp. during lockdown). We usually lay down to rest and it is a prayerful time.  It was all quiet in the house and I snug into the sunroom, which is filled with light and warmth due to its large windows. Here is the spot where I usually sit and do my writings, translations, studying etc. I did continue my work on the translation (into German) of my little book ‘Living with the Divine Love’ and also Al’s mediumship book.  I felt James so close and he asked me to write:*
I am James.

Good afternoon my daughter and God bless you as you indulge yourselves in the wonderful teachings of our Father, the teachings of the true and holy Love. It is indeed a great joy for us to see the ignition of something that is becoming, to bring a light that is seen far and wide. Your engagement at this time is of encouragement to not only yourselves but all who desire to partake in this great plan of our Heavenly Father. He has called us all to action, to love in profound ways, a love that bursts forth from a soul gifted by His Grace. Thus, we all are drawn to engage in magnificent ways, bonded in this call to action, each an important link.

We thank all who have come, scattered around the globe, coming together in this unusual way, this modern way you would say. Nevertheless, the power of love, the common intention of serving the Heavenly Father and our brothers and sisters, the collective desire for harmony, peace and joy is the magnetism that brings us all together.

God is in the center of all this; the source of all magnificence, of wisdom, of eternal Love, and a Light that outshines a thousand suns. The warmth and the Light of this Love is touching you all in this moment in deep ways. You feel this. You sense the animals so close, smell the ocean breeze, you feel the change that is coming, as the flowers blossom in brighter colors. Inhale deeply the breath of God’s Love, God’s Peace as His plan unfolds.

We are with you, we are close and in the coming weeks we will teach and reach to all in close and intimate ways. Listen and be open to the whispers, for the inspirations, be attuned and listen once more. Much is coming, as we joyfully embrace you all.

It is James, I greet you all.

*I was by myself when I received the message. I typed it as my fingers fly over the keyboard, not looking at the words which flow into each other with many typos and misspellings. My eyes are open to see the keyboard of sorts but feel the information is flowing into the fingers easily without strain in my brain. It seems though that I hear the words, let’s say feel the thoughts. I correct the spellings afterwards….once I feel I am present in this world again, filled with warmth and love, adjusting to a lower/slower frequency.*
