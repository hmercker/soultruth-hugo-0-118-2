I come, beloved souls. I come to reinforce the message from my beloved mother. I come to tell you all that you are indeed in God’s Grace and blessings, that the highest of angels minister to you all, beloveds. You who brave the waters of the human condition to try and purify and bring Truth to your brothers and sisters, I come to give to you a blessing of strength and fortitude that is tempered in love and joy. I come because I love you so, my beautiful, beautiful brothers and sisters. I come because I am your brother and I walk with you. I walk with you forever and we are bonded for all eternity. All eternity we shall walk into the Light, closer and closer to God, closer and closer to harmony and joy that love reigns supreme in our world. It shall be evermore, the great flow and expression of God's Essence within us, growing evermore for all eternity. 

I am with you, beloved souls. My love is with you and the love of many angels pour upon you at this time, and God's Great Love through the Holy Spirit is touching each of your souls at this moment. Open yourselves wide, wide beloveds and drink deep. This is the Holy Touch of God bringing to you all goodness and Light, all Truth and Love. Blessings beloveds, blessings to you all. God bless you.
