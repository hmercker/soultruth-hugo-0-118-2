# Findhorn Foundations

March 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Eileen, I’ve been listening to your beautiful prayer. I shall not take much of your time because I know you are on a timeline.

I would say this. More important than crossing every “t” and dotting every “i” is to get across your intention - to embrace community and to present God’s love from a new paradigm. And as I have reminded you before remind them of my words. For the Foundation of Findhorn was a spiritual foundation and your Foundation is a spiritual foundation, both based in God’s love. Everything is in order, you need not worry. You need not debate every issue but come to consensus now that you are in Grace and know that your friend Eileen approves all, blesses all, in God’s love. 

All my best. God bless you. I am Eileen.
