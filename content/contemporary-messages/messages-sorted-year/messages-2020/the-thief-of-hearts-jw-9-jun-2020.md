# The Thief of Hearts

I am here Charles, or as you know me, Charlie. I am your brother and friend on this glorious path of God's Love lifting us up from the human condition to the glory of the Celestial realms that await us. 

Did you know that as a child I was a thief, for a time, when my mother was ill and I was homeless and had to steal to eat and to live.  As bad as that may sound to you, it gave me a steely determination to succeed and I became, in a sense, a thief of hearts, capturing many in the world. We went through wars and other events in the world that hardened peoples' hearts and I was able to bring them joy and humor and to see the light, but also to remind them of poverty and charity, of those who struggle, the plight of the working man and woman, and the dangers of dictatorship. Yet all these things I approached in the spirit of love with joy in my heart and a wish to bless others, in a sense to heal them of their wounds, to bring a song and a dance and a smile (yes!) to them. 

I have met the master and I barely have words to express his countenance but he humbly said to me : “Oh, I too was a thief, I came to steal people from their somnambulant lives and their restrictive beliefs, into the arms of God and His great love”

I tell you this my friends because whatever you think your station is in life now, you know Gods' Love lifts you up and in that awakening and in that flow as you say, there is joy and blessing and harmony. Let these be your gifts to the world. I shall go now as there are others wishing to speak. 

With all my love and joy and blessings, I am your brother in Gods' love. May God bless you all, I am Charles.
