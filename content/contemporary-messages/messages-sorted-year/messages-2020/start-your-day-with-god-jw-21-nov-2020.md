I am here sister Care. 
  
My beloved brothers and my beloved man. When you wake in the morning in a state of gratitude and say, *“Thank You God for another day, how may I serve You? Thank You for this love You have put in my soul, and joy in my heart”,* that is a wonderful way to start a day!  And, as my beloved knows, I would rise and sing to the children, *“Rise and shine and give God your glory, glory!”*  
  
When you awake and you feel disconnected from your Creator, in a state of negativity, and you have so many reasons you can give yourself why the world is not right, why you’re not happy, and so forth. That too is a blessing! That is telling you pray to be reconnected. Negativity and feeling disconnected can be a wonderful blessing because it is a lesson telling you it’s time to pray. Before you get up from your bed (you can pray), *“Dear God, bring Your Love into my soul, the joy of Your Presence into my heart. May Your Angels be with me this day. May I be guided and be in Your Will every step of the way, that I may serve You and give You glory, because this my joy.”*  Either way your day begins it will end in Oneness with God in love and you will bring this throughout your day, whatever the circumstance whatever the reaction, be it good, be it negative, you will bring the light of love in your soul to all. And this light my brothers, you have! Just flip the switch and light up the room. 
 
I am with you on your walk today as you allow the will of God to be your will and be a healing to all, a blessing to all, an answered prayer, and a channel of God’s love as you wish to be.  And so, you are!  I leave you with all my love, all my blessings. I am your sister and friend and your beloved. I am Care. How I love you. God bless you!
