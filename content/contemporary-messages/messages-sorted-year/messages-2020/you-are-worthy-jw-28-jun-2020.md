# You are Worthy

June 28<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your sister and friend Care. I wish to affirm to each one that you are worthy. Worthy of receiving God’s love. For we are all His children. I used to sing first thing in the morning : *“Rise and shine and give God your glory-glory.”* Of course sometimes they (my children) were quite grumpy and reluctant *“oh mom”.* But in my prayers as I dealt with my own issues of un-worthiness and allowed God to touch my soul, my soul awakened and I could not help but proclaim the joy and the glory and the happiness even while on earth. So please know you are truly worthy of the gift of God’s Love and the company of His angels. 

May you receive His Love in great abundance and shine your light on every being. I am your sister and friend, a redeemed soul in the Celestial heavens and I love you. I am Care. May God bless you.
