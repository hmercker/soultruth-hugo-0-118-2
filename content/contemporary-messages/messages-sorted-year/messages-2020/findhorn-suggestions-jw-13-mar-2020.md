I am here your sister Eileen, I am so happy that you have understood my suggestions and my comments and taken them to heart in working up your proposals. The die is cast. Now as the events on earth conspire to draw people into their souls beyond mere survival on earth, the timing of your request seems very auspicious indeed.

As you shore up what you wish to say and propose please know that I am just delighted with the work you have done. You honor me and you will be a great blessing to my dear Findhorn. May many come that will be open to Godâ€™s love. May many come that the portal of light at Findhorn may be bright and may what your community and others have created in the world truly surround the earth in light and love and peace, that each soul will awaken to this glorious gift. 

I thank you with all my heart and I shall be with you truly. So, carry on and allow the flow of the love to carry you, and it shall. I love you, God bless you. I am your sister and friend, Eileen. God bless you.
