# The Intention to Know Who You Are

January 9<sup>th</sup>, 2020

FUSC Circle of Light Collection, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Faith Nyquist received by Maureen Cardoso

My name is Faith and may each of you feel the grace, the essence and Love of your beloved Creator touching you with the kiss of Love upon your soul.  Answering the prayer that your soul has risen up in love and longing to the Creator. For the longing calls forth a response from the Beloved One and the uniting of the Creators Love and your love dance within your soul.

My dear friends, what a powerful intention the dear daughter put forth wanting to know who she is.  How more powerful could a prayer and intention be than this? For it is a call from her soul and every soul, this desire to be known to be awakened to be alive and thriving with all its potentials and gifts and talents being expressed.  May each of you have this blessing of knowing who you are.  I will say to you without a doubt, should you continue to put effort toward the awakening of your soul by receiving the blessing of this Love from the Creators Soul into your soul you will know who you are fully in Truth,  with wisdom and with a desire to be at-one with your beloved Creator.

This powerful intention will change your world.  For each and every soul who walks in the light with the Love of God emanating and dancing within their soul has a powerful effect upon the world.  As the transformation of the soul and the healing of the wounds and the hurts that are deep within the soul are cleansed and healed,  the individual’s light is bright and there is an illumination about them that will draw others toward them.  These souls long to know what it is that is different and unique of this individual so full of light with their eyes sparkling their smile bright their words and actions full of love with care and giving.  This beloved beautiful friends is what will change your world. It is the plan that is in place and why we your Celestial friends work so diligently with our beloved brothers and sisters upon Earth. Walking closely with you helping you in times of great need to turn and face your beloved Creator and understanding in you this need, the need and a longing to belong.  Beloveds, that which will fill and feed this need is the Love of God.  There is not one other human being, Celestial Angel or bright spirit that can feed, fuel, nourish and nurture your deepest need.

Consider the blessing of coming to know who you are by a simple yet profound, powerful and transforming prayer asking God, through the sincerity of your heart, to touch and to bless you with the Divine Essence. Open yourself to receive the highest gift available to all.  Consider the draw and need of your soul – your true self, this light within your being.

May this blessing be yours now and always.  My love is with you, I am Faith.  God bless you beloveds, God bless you.
