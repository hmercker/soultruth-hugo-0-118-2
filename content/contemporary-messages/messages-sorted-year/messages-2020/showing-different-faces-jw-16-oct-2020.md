I am here Judas and I come in the love of God and my dear brother Kahlil Gibran is with us today. We were ruminating as to who might speak and Kahlil defers to myself. I wanted to clarify about the messages of the masks. And this was a discussion that we had of showing different faces to different people in different situations. And then when touched by the real which the Sun in this story represents, the Love of God, there is a Oneness where all the masks drop. 

This is not to say that among different groups of people, different situations that you wouldn’t approach what you may say or do in ways that are more appropriate with that group of person. What the message here is this: *“Instead of being a little bit of this person and a little bit of that as you become at One in the Love of God, all your gifts become channeled through the prism of all the colors which can only be seen when the light is shining through your soul.”* 

This is the crystallization of the soul in God’s Love where there is a Oneness and yet there is a much larger field of embrace than trying to piecemeal each thing you wish to convey. Picture a crystal with the full spectrum of colors coming through to each one.

For even the most beautiful painting is as if nothing in a dark room. So yes, you can of course present things in the appropriate manner to whomever you are addressing. Let me clarify again. Describing to a blind man a painting might be quite difficult unless he could feel it through his touch, if he could feel the emotion or what it represented in terms of landscape or the heart. So therefore you would find an appropriate way to describe something to such a person. And as the analogy of blindness is sometimes used when referring to spiritual blindness or even short sidedness I hope my description is revealing.

My brother Kahlil is a beautiful soul and he shed a light through his heart into his writings and his connection in spirit awakened in him something very deep and to this day has this effect upon his readers. Oh, if you could see him now a beautiful progressed soul who lives in a realm that is the doorway to the Celestial Kingdom you would be amazed. And so he will communicate in the future from where he is now and the condition of his soul in the Love of God. 

I thank him for deferring to me. All of us here we leave you with the blessings of the abundance of God’s glorious love. We thank you we love you. I am your brother in Christ. I am Judas of Kerioth.

Later Judas came and told me to look up this from Matthew 6:22: *“The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”*
