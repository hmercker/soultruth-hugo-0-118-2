# Walking the path of Divine Love

April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Mediumship Workshops, Swakopmund, Namibia

Augustine received by Helge Mercker

I am Augustine, your teacher and friend. I am here to join you in your studies and prayers.

I assist all of you on your paths to soul awakening, in your progressions of soul, teaching and bringing lessons of soul development and many other teachings pertaining to the Truths of God. It has been revealed in many messages by many angels and our beloved Master Jesus.  I wish to bring a teaching today and wish for you to write in a way that ‘catches’ my words.

The lesson of love is a lesson in opening up to our Creator, to our Heavenly Father. His hand reaches to each one of us, always seeking to bring His presence close to His child. As you know, it is difficult in your world to know God by the subtleties of the soul for not much attention is given to that part of man. As we have mentioned before, many changes are upon you and much will be happening in rather unpredictable ways. This is why we say you have to be strong, to be close to God, to not lose your orientation, or your bearings in the pursuit of the path of Divine Love. We encourage you to consistently pray and to drop deep into your souls; to build the connection to your soul, bringing the understanding from deep within oneself to the forefront, to recognize one’s skills and gifts, one’s talents and how to express this soul-being that is filled with the Fathers Love. Moving in this world as a channel of Love is the most rewarding way to be, as reflexively the soul desires to be in a state of love and in connection with God. In being open to God’s Will, in being His channel of Love, the footing on this path becomes more solid, each step carrying one forward to new heights, new discoveries. There is a guiding light that shines forth as God’s Hand is upon you and the angels assist in directing you towards fulfilling your soul purpose.

The Grace of God is touching you all in this time, calling upon each of His children to come to their awakening, to live a life of peace and harmony with His Creation. Souls are searching and seeking a new future, letting go of the old and tired ways. Many are looking for the new impulse, the new avenues. May you all awaken to your soul purpose and be true to your calling of soul as you listen to God’s whispers regarding the coming action of Love.

God bless you my daughter, my love is with you and may this day bring you the blessings as God pours His Love upon you. God bless you, Augustine loves you.

I am James and I wish to add my greeting of Love and we pray with you dear daughter. We are very close and I am pleased that you write as we speak to you. God bless you my beloved charge. I am close and I love you.
