# Guidance for Direct Voice Retreat

January 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Direct Voice, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I'm glad to see that you have all decided to come together for more sessions of Direct Voice preparation and development. I am happy with the message that came through the dear daughter which I gave a few days ago, that this information is essentially correct, that we indeed will leave it to you what dates you wish to come together and that when do you pick the appropriate times, it will be in harmony, that all will be in the joy of re-joining one another in this effort, of giving of yourself in time and in prayer, to support one another in this great venture.

Indeed, it is important and necessary that you consider your preparations beforehand, even this early date. It is important to continue to intensify your prayers, to be strong within your bodies, and to be clear within your minds that you may listen to God's directions, guidance, that you might be open to God's blessings and to the ministrations of the angels who are ever eager to continue to help you in your soul growth, to help you with a clear connection and bond with your Creator, to inspire you to continue to pray earnestly for the blessings of God's Love.

There is always preparation, my dear friends, always a time to put yourself in the Light of God. You must make that time, beloved souls. This is no time for idling away those moments in your life. Or as you are beginning to see, the situation in your world is intensifying. Changes are manifesting. Situations are becoming more complex and difficult. It is time, my friends, to truly take heart the guidance that you have received to truly be serious about how you may fit into this great plan of God, to be in the flow of God's Love, to make this your focus, your daily purpose, that your prayers may be indeed focused and powerful, that your thoughts may go towards the upliftment of humanity, of yourself, of this world that suffers allowing God to use you as His channels of love. Each day, each day, beloved souls, brings its opportunities, its time to be a light.

Be in the Grace of God, my friends, and know that each moment you spend in prayer, each moment you contemplate higher thoughts, that indeed you are closer to God, more in alignment with God. This is necessary for how else can we bring forth these gifts if you are not in great alignment, great harmony with God, His laws? It takes discipline, desire, efforts, longing, and an expression of the highest Truth and Love that you are capable of in your lives.

You cannot sit idly by and think that God and the angels will do all the work, will prepare an easy walk into the light. Indeed, you have your responsibilities. You must take them seriously and seek alignment with God. This is your preparation, beloved souls, along with strengthening your bodies and cleansing your thoughts so that all is in light, all is in harmony, all is powerfully aligned so that you and we may do our work together and walk along this great path. This destiny that God has put before us continues to encourage us to step forward. You know that we are with you and we deeply desire for you to be with us. Together we will walk this road.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. My desires for great success in our ventures continue to be my fervent prayer and effort on your behalf. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem.
