# It is Time to Come Together as One

February 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020

FUSC, Gibsons, BC, Canada

White Cloud received by Al Fike

I am here, White Cloud. It is time, my friends, for all peoples and nations, all philosophies and religions, all perspectives and perceptions to come together as one. The time for individuality is coming to a close, where you will give up something for the benefit of all, rather than guarding your own individuality so closely and so firmly to your bosom. It is time to love and accept your brothers and sisters. It is time to go to the Source of All that is Love and Light, peace and healing, and to ask for a blessing. That you may shed those skins that keep you from love, that keep you from light in the world, and walk boldly and lovingly in your true nature and true selves which God has given you.

This is found in your hearts, beloved souls, not in your heads. In that deep place of feeling and knowing that your dear brother and sister have opened their hearts to you. They are an example. We must reciprocate with our hearts to them and to all you meet, all cultures and ways that you may encounter in your world. Open your hearts. Embrace them in love. Ask for the Creator to put this Love into you, the power of this Love to transform and bring unity to this world.

Blessed are those who are meek and humble, who seek to serve in Love. Blessed are those who are strong in Light. Blessed are all the children of this world who seek to be in the Grace of God. May you be blessed, beloved souls, in this search and journey for all that is true, all that is of love, all that is of the Creator. You will find your way, given your desire and effort to do so. This will come to each one of you, an opening, an understanding, a blessing, a sense of truth and peace, as God puts His Hand upon you and awakens you to Love.

God bless you. I am White Cloud and I have been with you in this time together. May you be blessed. My love is with you. God bless you.
