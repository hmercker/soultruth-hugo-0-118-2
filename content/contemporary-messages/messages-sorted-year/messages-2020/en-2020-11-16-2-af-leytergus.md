# Every Soul Has a Purpose

Leytergus received by Al Fike

I am Leytergus. And I come to speak to the dear son, William, who is contemplating, questioning his role as a servant of God in this world. This dear and beloved soul has unique gifts, has a brilliant mind, and is tenacious to the extreme. What more could we ask as a leader for this endeavor of creating an institution of learning and discovering the abilities of the soul and how to awaken these faculties? He has been well educated and has many abilities to organize, to vision, and see the direction in which an organization may take for success. He is well loved by we in the Celestial Kingdom. He is indeed well loved by God, as are all of you.

There is a need for leadership and there is a need for clarity so that all may progress efficiently and effectively in the future. I think that you all can agree that this beloved soul is ideally situated to don the mantle of leadership in your group. And this does not mean that he will lead in an autocratic kind of way, as this is not his style, as you well know. But he will lead as a true leader should, considering all of your efforts and comments thoroughly and gathering them together into a comprehensive vision for the future.

This great effort, as our beloved instrument has indicated, will be led by this beloved soul wisdom with wisdom and grace. And it is beneficial that he may accept this destiny and keep his focus upon it. For this is a great blessing and honor for him to lead in this way and to bring the wisdom of his soul and mind together so that all requirements and aspects of this venture will be met in harmony.  
Every soul has a purpose. Every soul has the opportunity to fulfill that purpose. For some, acting upon their purpose may be a simple task. For others, it may be a great task. In this case, it is a monumental task, and one of great importance, for we are eager to utilize the gifts and talents of those of you on the earth plane in ways that will influence and bring greater light to your world.

And God, as we have said many times, has a plan. And when you step into your role, that place within His plan, there is great joy and excitement, as the soul acknowledges the Will of God and the awakening of those seeds within the individual that God has planted from the very beginning, that are beginning to sprout and come alive. Such joy it is for the soul to be awakened in this way, to understand, truly understand its purpose and its unique qualities and gifts.

And as you all continue to grow in the Divine Love of God, so each of you will see more clearly and powerfully the purpose that is to be fulfilled, the role that is eminently suited for you, so that your gifts may be expressed in all their exquisite form and nature, capacities. Joy will come to all. There will not be a sense of rivalry or disharmony, rather the opposite - a sense of being a part of the whole, that unique and wondrous congregation of souls directed and focused on purpose, on doing God's Will, on serving humanity. What greater calling can there be than this, my beloved friends, to bring the truth of God's Love to humanity in ways and means they will inspire and educate and direct many souls towards the Truth? And in this you will ignite a great fire of understanding that will spread through many souls. You will see how your struggles and efforts on Earth will be rewarded with a tremendous unfolding of this purpose and means to serve God.

And so I encourage my son, William, and all of you to continue to work together, to seek the truth as you move forward, to not speculate, but to pray and know what it is that you must do in regards to this planned and beautiful unfolding of God's Will. And the details will come to you, beloved souls, in flashes, in visions, in inspired thought, in joyous recognition, as God continues to lay His Hand upon you, upon us all in these ventures to proliferate Love in the world.

Blessings to you all, beloved souls. You have been given a great opportunity, and you will find all the resources required, all the individuals who are meant to be with you in this venture, and all the Love poured upon you, to unite you, to bring harmony and peace. Nothing will be wasted, beloved souls, and much will be gained upon this journey of love and dedication to God.

God bless you, keep you upon the path divine that God's Love may feed your soul and minds to the higher things and knowings and understandings of what is meant to be in the universe of God's creation and Love. God bless you beloveds. I am Leytergus. And I come to encourage you all, to encourage my son, William, who is meant to take a great journey and has been prepared for such for many years. God bless. God bless. My love is with you, as is my commitment to guide.
