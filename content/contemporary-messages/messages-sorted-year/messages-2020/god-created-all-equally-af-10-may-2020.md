Beloved souls, may the Heavenly Father’s Touch be firmly upon your souls, that His Love may indeed open your souls wide to its blessing. I am Mary and I come to acknowledge all my sisters, all the women of this world of yours and mine, who are blessed, all are blessed with the sweet nature of love; this powerful blessing that God put within his children who are indeed of that gentle nature and feminine expression. That this gift that is given may continue to flourish in your world and that this gift of  exquisite love of the souls of all my sisters may continue to be enhanced by the Father’s Touch of Love. It is the power of this Love, the expression of this Love through those who are predisposed to give so with gentleness and acceptance and grace.

This will be a powerful factor in your changing world, beloveds. The power of this feminine love, this soulful love, will change your world as it continues to rise in ascendency in your world and continues to be expressed in many different ways,  exhibiting its unique beauty and wonderment that is all part of God’s Creation. The nurturing, the embracing, the tolerance and the willingness to love beyond all else, these things are what are needed in your world. These aspects of the nature of women are indeed important and crucial expressions that will lead others towards what is truly love’s expression in the world.

There is a particular kind of strength in women, a particular steadfastness, a loyalty, a willingness to be open and loving to all they meet. These things are necessary and so needed in your world. I urge all women to continue to be strong in these aspects of their nature, to express them in many different ways, to be true to their souls, their very nature, so that they may stand up and be an example to the world of what is important, what can indeed change the world. 

Do not allow anyone to denigrate you. Do not allow the biases and prejudices of so many cultures to put you below the status of men, for this is error and it is not a truth. Equality is a truth as God created all equally. Although God created each with a unique nature and capacity to love, may all of you who continue to seek to enhance these capacities to love, to have them transformed by God's Love, may you carry this Truth wherever you go. May you express this love wherever you are and whomever you are with. 

Beloved souls, it is important that you are strong in love, that you are true in love, that all that you are in the great loving nature of your souls, expanding evermore with God’s great blessing of His Love and be a powerful flow and channel in the world. God calls upon you to walk in the Light of His Grace and blessings, His Love and the power of the Light that comes with all these blessings so that you stand within this Light and that you walk upon the Divine Path guided by God ever forward. May each of you, men or women, indeed express your true soulful gifts and natures blessed by God, in this world that is hungering for guidance and direction, for the solid ground on which you stand and express your truth from those great foundations that have been laid in love.

May God bless you upon that journey, beloved souls. My love is with you. I love you all. I embrace you all. You are my sisters. You are my brothers. We are all children of God and we shall move, walk forward in His Great Love. God bless you, beloveds. I am Mary and I love you. God bless you.
