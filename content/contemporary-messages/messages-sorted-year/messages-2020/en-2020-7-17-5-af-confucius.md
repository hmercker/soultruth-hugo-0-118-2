Confucius received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, beloved souls. I am Confucius. I am pleased to see these beautiful and bright spirits of God, these children together in harmony and peace together, seeking truth together. So you will find yourselves upon a journey where are you will meet many who have their beliefs and understandings of truth within their minds but within their souls is a longing, a fellowship to feel a part of a family of earnest souls seeking truth and to serve God.

Many will gather and gather again and come to one another in earnest desire to love, to honour, to work together for truth, to be a channel of blessings for many. Yes, there are many in your world who have a secret longing to be a part of such a family and yet, do not know how they may accomplish and find fulfillment in this desire.

Many thousands of souls in your world have an inkling of truth and a desire to nurture this truth within them. I ask you, beloved souls, to pray for those who have come to light but do not know how to express their gifts, these great potentials that are eager to come forth in the world.

Pray that there will be opportunities and openings through God's instruments, instrumentalities to bring this understanding forth and the fulfillment of their soulsâ€™ desires for this is what is needed in your world, beloved souls, at this time not more scientific knowledge but spiritual awakening so that in time this balance may be achieved between the accomplishments of men and the spiritual power of the soul that may come together in harmony to make a world that is indeed in harmony and in light.

So the journey is great. The work is great and it requires strength. It requires dedication. It requires faith. It requires love for all. You will find your ways, beloved souls. God is guiding you. We are with you and we bless you, beloveds. We bless you. Love Divine. Peace. Love Divine. Peace. God bless you.
