Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

I am Goldie and know that I will take advantage of these times where you are at home and in need of some amusement. I will come and tickle behind your ears and under your chin and whisper lovely words in your ear so that you may all feel some joy and some excitement in these times that draw you away from your busy lives.

It is time for all of you to consider us as your friends. While you are alone in your rooms, know that we are with you that we may indeed have joyful prayers, conversations and love. Bring joy into your lives, beloved souls. Know that God will bless you with joy. Feel that joy from the tips of your toes to the top of your head with that joy rushing in and giving you relief from all those days that you have had that are stressful and difficult. Make this your time to be with God, your time to be with us. It will be full. It will be full indeed.

God bless you. I am Goldie. I love each and every one of you. You are my friends and my love is great for you all. God bless you, beloved souls, I love you. God bless you.
