Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your brother Judas and I come in the grace of God as a disciple of the master. I wish to offer you a bit of advice. A very simple practice of connecting with God, with feeling His presence, your soul and His soul, and that is this: 

> Find a quiet place free from distractions, turn off the world, set aside all the things you must do, your material concerns and even your spiritual concerns, and for a moment just Be. Feel your being and the spirit of life in your physical body and beyond for you are not limited. Feel the light of your soul. Feel your heart and its longings for love. Allow these longings to go to God. Be receptive. Relax into love. Release your mind that your soul may communicate and be at one with its Creator from you heart. You have nothing to lose that isn’t worth losing. What you have to gain is the glory of God’s love. Allow this.

I thank you. All my love and blessings. May God’s love touch you deeply on this journey I am your eternal friend in God’s love. I am Judas.
