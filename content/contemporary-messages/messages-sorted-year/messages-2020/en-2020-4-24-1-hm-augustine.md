# Truth Must Be Experienced by the Soul

April 24<sup>th</sup>, 2020

General Collection, Swakopmund, Namibia

Augustine received by Helge Mercker

I greet you in this morning hour, it is your friend and teacher Augustine.

The writings of Truth are being revealed often, in many ways and on many different occasions. A relevant truth can be found in what is important only in that moment in time, when the soul is open and desires to ‘see’ the truth. Thus, once seen, the soul experiences it in a conscious way; which means you have a perception and conscious experience of something not necessarily recognized by the mind but experienced by the soul. This is what we wish for, for you to realize, the experiencing part of your soul, the being that is in direct contact with its Creator. A soul filled with the substance of its Creator is in even closer connection and relationship, in tune with its Creator. The continuous desire to seek a constant connection or attachment to this source of all truth, of all wisdom and love, is the process that reveals the inherent gifts and fabric of that soul being. Finding the way to re-establish this sacred connection to one’s Creator through the repeated reception of the actual substance, the very fabric that is the composite of the Creator, requires effort and a burning desire on the part of the object or offspring.

The concept of being completely infilled, converted or changed to something new all at once, is not in harmony with the Laws of God. All processes are gradual and flowing, adapting to rhythms and patterns that we call life and soul progression, occurring when one seeks to develop their soul. The way required to fulfill the right method of progression is understood as demonstrated by our Master Jesus. The right way to fulfill the soul’s inherent longing of becoming at-one with its Creator, our Heavenly Father. This process is an ever evolving, stepwise, and progressive journey of moments of realization, and moments of utmost joy and happiness as new vistas open up along this path of at-onement with God.

The consistency in seeking out this connection on a daily basis in your material world is indeed a great challenge. There are so many distractions and distortions, and a complete neglect of something so valuable, which is the human soul. In the times to come, much emphasis will be on the development of the true man, who is soul. Longings from that place that is recognized, acknowledged and honoured will become the norm, the true soul longing going ever forth to God, constantly hungering for more of the substance that brings us more and more into alignment with God. Through honest and heartfelt prayers from the deepest inner core of a human, will spring forth the force to reach God’s soul. And through this touch, God reaches out and responds through His instrumentalities, His mechanisms, His own Being, enveloping Love, embracing the object of His affection to be born anew in the recognition of its own magnificence.

Continue to pursue this path of Glory and Love. Recognize the path laid before you, see the signposts and the direction it takes, embrace each moment of discovery and the Love filled soul draws ever closer to the location of residence in everlasting peace and joy, magnificence and wisdom.

God bless you my daughter. May you feel God’s touch of Love upon you as His blessing of Love infills your being right now. Show the way to be walked to all whom you love, and you will walk together in the everlasting home of light and beauty, of peace and joy.

God bless you, my love is with you. I am Augustine and I will come again in accordance to your desire and wish for me to come and write. God bless you and I love you.

*Details on the Reception: it was in early morning hours around 4 am and I was still very sleepy but in a prayerful state. I was by myself and started to type once I felt the Angels close. It was Augustine who came forward and spoke. I saw him standing to the left and a group of about 20 people or spirits to the right. I felt this to be a learning opportunity for me, on how to speak in a way that the listeners can understand or how truths can be conveyed using the ways and expressions of the listeners. (He refers to that in the introduction).*

*I hardly saw the keyboard as it was still dark, only the screen was illuminated.*
