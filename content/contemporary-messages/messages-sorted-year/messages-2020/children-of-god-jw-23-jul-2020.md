I am here Care. I ask you to reach for the Love, this Love Divine from the Heavenly Father that brings an answer to every question, that heals every wound, that brings the peace that passes the mind's understanding. Allow your souls to reach out to God to lift you above your minds and the troubles and allurements and entanglements of the world. This way you bring a blessing to the world a troubled world. 

When you cannot see the path ahead you must walk in faith and trust in God and pray for guidance. The light that you see is the light that shines upon the path and leads the way for your walk into the future in every moment. As your soul receives the Love of God you can walk in this faith and you can be in harmony with the Will of God and all the laws of the natural world stretched up to the Celestial realms from where we come. There is no inharmony here. 

As God embraces you and touches your souls, as you let go and allow this Love to heal you that you may become at-one with God, your being is transformed. This feeling of bliss and of joy - let it be yours and bring it to others. Bring your light into every room as a child who comes in joy and without a care, lightens a room. You begin to realize the words to enter the Kingdom: *“You must become as the little ones, as the children.”*  

The innocence of God’s Love as the child has faith in the parent to protect and guide and lead the way so let all of God’s children have this faith and trust in the protection and love of our Heavenly Father. You have many guides and you only need to ask and we are there. Dear sister should you require my assistance or that of my beloved we are here for you. He has given his heart to God and this work but if you need me to come just call. 

May this light in this circle of prayer stay with you. May your souls be lifted and awakened for you truly will be and are a blessing to all. With all my love and blessings to you. May the Grace of God be yours. I am Care.
