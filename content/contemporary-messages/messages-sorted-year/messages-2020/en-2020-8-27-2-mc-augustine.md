# Revealing the Potentials that Come with Divine Love

Augustine received by Maureen Cardoso

It is your teacher Augustine. I have come to share a message, to reveal as you say, more fully what the potentials are for your workings together for within each one of souls resides some of what we call the Divine Love, the very Substance of God, the Living Waters, the Truth and the wisdom that your beloved Creator bestows upon you so that you and your soul may awaken, may know discernment of truth and wisdom, may be able to guide your brothers and sisters with the intention of bringing them more closely to the Beloved Creator.

Just as you walk a path, your individual path, to what can be deemed the Godhead, so too is the guidance to be given to humanity to show them the way of making a connection, their soul to the great Over-Soul. It is by the Grace of receiving the Divine Substance within each one’s soul that healing, healing of the soul, the ones through one’s life experiences that bring a darkened condition, preventing the light of their soul from shining forth, experiencing joy and love, peace, harmony, and a sense of ease.

As you have your souls blessed in a deep way by the Grace of God, you too shall understand the deep resonance of God’s cleansing upon your soul. The gifts of the soul that God has imbued within you, awakened by the Grace of this Love shall serve in a deep, abiding way bringing healing, bringing truth. Your instrumentality, God will awaken. Many souls shall continue to come before each and every one of you for within you there is purity. There is a desire. There is a longing to know, to guide, and to share wisdom before your brothers and sisters.

So yes, my dear son, this instrument did see me standing behind you in a very strong, real way. You did have the experience of me speaking through you this morning. As your love continues to grow and awaken by the Grace of the Divine Essence, our rapport will become very clear. So these beloved souls who have been placed before you, who share what are the teachings of the Divine Essence and how to obtain the great blessing, the highest gift for all of mankind, they share a Truth that you have both felt the inflowing in your souls.

I would like to invite the two of you to continue to sit with God in the silence with a longing from your hearts and souls to receive evermore deeply this inflowing, this inflowing of Love, these Living Waters that shall flow through you deepening that which will come through you. We do not ask that you change anything that you currently are already part of. But we ask or encourage you to add this into your spiritual workings. Bring the receiving of the Divine Essence into your souls daily and God shall show you ever more greatly that which is meant for you.

There are many Celestial Angels and high spirits in your midst as we speak now. It is also the great workings of us being able to speak through you that we may reach those souls who are struggling in spirit to move forward. So there are many rounds that we long to be able to teach through and our beautiful friends upon Earth long to serve. You are called. Your soul understands. As you invoke this blessing of Divine Love within your soul, the mind and soul shall harmonize and that which does not serve truth shall fall away.

God is Love. God is Grace, wisdom, Truth, peace, and harmony. All of that is awaiting each and every one whose soul is blessed. Knowing God, the Divine Essence, carrying that within the soul, a reaching to God to say, *“My dear and gracious Creator, the one who knows everything of me, bless me, bless me with your Love. Touch me deeply with this inflowing and most gracious gift so that I may come to know my true self and the one who has created me and I may see with eyes of love and speak the words of love and touch through the hands of love for that great healing of mankind.”*

I thank you for hearing my words and for opening to this great blessing for we desire to teach through many. I am Augustine your teacher and my love is with each and every one of you. God loves you.
