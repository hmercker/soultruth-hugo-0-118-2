# Guidance on New Book

General Collection, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Martin Luther received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Martin Luther. I have been put in charge of your efforts to bring forth the messages of the angels, with clarity and power, to bring Truth. I have so instructed my charge (Helge) who has responded well with her list of important messages from spirit. So, I will go to each one who is engaged in this work and help to inspire them and support them in these efforts.

This book, in a way, is a manifesto for living in a changing world. It is not the beginnings of a religious organization, but an instruction on living in harmony with God. So those messages that the angels have given over a number of years through this instrument that will reflect this theme and will be well-utilized within this book. Each who does their research will be guided, will have a sense of propriety and importance with particular messages which they may research and read. It will not be a confusing and unregulated effort. Rather, a simple grid of research may be laid out for each one to ascribe to and stick within the parameters of this designation. This way, there will be no cross- pollination of efforts that will confuse the matter.

Yes, categories are important and necessary so that the reader may understand what he is or she is looking at. A short description at the beginning of each category would be helpful. An introduction as to the source and beginnings of this medium’s service as a channel for us would be an important first chapter. We are all well aware of the various categories that are important for this book. My only suggestion is that you do not delve into the direct voice messages at this time, for we may reserve those for another volume. There will be other volumes in the making. So I would suggest that you save all of your work. Those messages that do not make it into this first volume may indeed be included in other subsequent volumes. This work will continue for quite some time as volumes are composed and published as this instrument and other instruments add to the body of work that will be shared with mortals from the Celestial angels. So it is an ongoing project, documenting this great journey that you are all upon and our mutual attempts to communicate with humanity the Truths of the soul and of God.

I once led a reformation in an attempt to clarify the spiritual doctrines of the time. To some degree, you are all engaged in your own efforts of reforming Truth that is adopted by many religions, religious orders of your time. Progress is always an important factor in the development of humanity in your world. Spiritual progress has been greatly neglected and needs to be reignited and come to the consciousness of all who dwell upon the Earth. Without this foundation of thought and deed, of prayer, of acknowledging the soul, acknowledging God, the efforts of men are indeed very vulnerable to decay and darkness. For, it is easy to pervert the goodness of the creativity of mankind into something that is counterproductive to God's plan for the spiritual progression of each soul.

Unfortunately, many souls who dwell upon this Earth are destined to fall into darkness or semi-darkness on our side of life after their time is done. This is mostly because of ignorance and that so many souls are asleep and have no interest in spirituality, of these deeper parts of themselves. Today the Earth continues to darken as the motivations of humanity are focused upon material well-being, scientific thinking, and the inventions of various technologies that humanity believes will solve all the dilemmas of life on your Earth. Given a strong spiritual foundation from which these actions and intentions and desires are based, bringing  a measure of wisdom and humility and grace to these actions, then greater light may expand in your world.

You are bringing a key to humanity, something that is vitally necessary at this time for the evolution and development of your brothers and sisters. So, we place upon you a great deal of responsibility, a great gift of the opportunity to serve God in this way, a beautiful expression of your souls directed by God for the benefit of all. It is an important responsibility and commitment that you make. One which will bring to you many rewards and will open doors of understanding and of opportunities to speak and to serve, to be God’s channels in the world.

I am glad that you have all taken up the call to serve God in this way. You will find that I will be with you and other angels will assist you in this effort. It will be of ease, of upliftment, of grace, of God, so that it becomes a pleasure, an unfolding of your soul’s desires to serve humanity and to serve God. These opportunities are Divinely blessed and as such, you will be given all that you require and many blessings to uplift you in your efforts. God works with humanity in many ways. When each soul is in harmony with God's Will, so all are blessed. Even those souls who are around and within the orbit of that individual will be blessed.

God sends His Light, His Love, His healing, His peace. All these gifts which a soul yearns for and desires will be given to each of you in abundance. When this offer was given to you, did your soul not leap for joy at the prospect of serving in this way? So, your soul has responded in Light, in love, in generosity. Expressing your gifts and capacity to help correlate the Truths that have been given and bring them to your brothers and sisters in such a way that they may understand and be inspired by the words of the angels and by your own words.

So this journey begins, my beloved souls. I will continue to monitor your efforts and assist you thusly. God’s Hand is upon you. The stage is set and may you play your part and find the treasures that are inherent in service, in love, that your life may be filled with a joy, a sense of purpose, a knowing of the soul that will enrich all that you do and all that you are.

God bless you. God bless you dearly, beloved souls. I shall come again and speak to you. I am Martin Luther. I am, as well, excited for this venture. God bless you. My love is with you.
