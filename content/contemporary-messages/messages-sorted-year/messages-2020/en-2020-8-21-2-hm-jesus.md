# Instantaneous Love Connection

August 21<sup>st</sup>, 2020

General Collection, Swakopmund, Namibia

Jesus received by Helge Mercker

My dear daughter, I am Jesus.

I wish to express my love to you and bring my reassurance, that I am with you. I am with you when you pray. I am with you in your work, your walks and all you do. I am with you as your elder brother and your protector, your guide and I love you. May God bless you as I bring my blessings to you, beloved dear child of God, our Father.

Much will be coming to mankind’s awareness; realizations that their creations of greed and negativity will not be sustained much longer. The crumbling systems of selfish thinking, of greed and power will struggle to have any following, as men turn away, looking for a better way, a kinder way filled with love and light. And thus the teachings of love, as given by me, will be gently embraced: teachings of the redeeming Love, of the eternal love that have opened up a way to be completely changed and born into a new creation, being able to enter the Heavens of God where His Love floods in and through everything.

Precious dear soul, seek this communion with God and be filled with timeless moments of deep connection and alignment, for these moments in your time are timeless in the reality of Love. In the fulfillment of the highest law no time measure is attached. Yet, seek this daily connection of love repeatedly. The daily sitting in stillness is beneficial in bringing the energies which influence you in your world, bringing you to a state of subdued calmness, enabling this endless connection of love. You may feel that the depth of this connection varies from time to time, however God’s Love has no degrees of intensity. Rather, it is your openness, your calmness and stillness within that can determine the degree of connection. How can you hear a whisper when all around you is filled with clutter and noise?

The repetition of daily engagement with our Father, will establish pathways and in time will be well used, making the connection an instantaneous and easy experience. And so the patterns are created, soul to Soul. Easy connection in an instant yet filled with powerful exchange.

My dear, sit again to write. Do not neglect this through your attitude and reluctance. I need and wish to write more. Bring forth your desire to establish this work that lays before you. My blessings and love are always with you. I am Jesus and yes, I am the Master of the Celestial Heavens, and the bringer of Truth to the world. May God bless you and I love you and will come again. Make time so I am able to write. God bless you and my love is with you.
