# Angels Have Come to Assist

August 7<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

A retinue of angels who have come to assist you in your prayers have worked hard to clear away conditions around each one of you, to help clear mindful conditions and psychic conditions around your spirit bodies and have helped to tune and align your bodies and your minds and your souls to assist you in light.

May I suggest that you take advantage of these blessings and gifts that are given in these Circles of Light and take yourselves to prayer often for now that the conditions, the worldly conditions, which often inhibit you in this regard, have been lifted from you in a great way and respect that brings light to you, then it will be easier in your prayers to be in touch with your angel friends, your soul, and with God. This is our gift to you. This is what we may do to uplift you and bless you. God has sanctioned this gift and will continue to allow us to bring to you these releases and upliftment and peace.

God bless you, beloved souls. May you continue to seek for the highest and come to know your own self truly and deeply. God bless you. Seretta Kem loves you. God bless you.
