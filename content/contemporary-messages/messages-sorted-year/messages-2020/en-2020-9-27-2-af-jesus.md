# Blessings to Increase our Faith and Inflowing of Divine Love in Our Souls

September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come to pray with you. I am Jesus. I come to be in your midst to uplift you and to draw all the blessings of heaven to each of you. I come so that you may increase your faith in the blessings of God's Love that continues to trickle into your souls and awaken such faith that you may know without doubt that you are loved by God. I come because the children of your world suffer greatly and most are lost and in darkness. Though they may feel all the comforts of the material life, within their souls is desolation and desperation. Yet, they do not feel or know this deep longing of the soul, to be freed from the entrapment of the mind and the entrapment of the human condition.

You have answered that call of your soul. You have come into a place of light beseeching God to touch your soul deeply, to awaken you to the truth and reality of God. So, I come to you, dear and brave souls that you are, loved by God in such a way that you are all uplifted, that you are all dedicated upon a journey, your feet fully upon the Divine Path seeking to know truth, to live truth, to be the truth of love.

You have allowed me to come. Your prayers and efforts together allow me to come into this place that we have made together, a place to meet, to pray, to love one another. In creating such a beautiful light, we will benefit the world with our efforts. Much will come of your prayers and our prayers. Together we make a beachhead of light in a darkened world. This will expand and strengthen as we continue to grow and awaken in the Father’s Love.

I too continue to aspire to awaken and grow in love for this journey is infinite. I am further ahead upon the path than you, but this is not mean that we are not brothers and sisters for we are and shall ever be brothers and sisters upon this path of Love. Dedicating ourselves to the truth of this Love, to serve God in love, to serve humanity and all spirits in love, to be together as one peoples acknowledging the Truth of God’s Love awakening that deep faith within our souls that shall carry us through all that may inhibit or challenge us in our spiritual journey to at-onement with God.

We are together, beloved souls, upon a great journey. Rest assured that you have joined this great and vast family of redeemed souls sojourning towards God, releasing all that may inhibit us and restrict us from this journey so that we may know the great joy and love that is part of this journey and that we may be released from all that is not of love and truth. We are together, beloved souls.

Know that I am with you. I am your brother and I am your friend. I will continue to reach towards each one of you, to pray for each one of you so that you may join us within the Celestial Heavens in time and know the great joys that we know, the great wonderment and light and beauty and truth and love that we know. This is your destiny. This is the desire of your soul manifest at this very moment carrying you towards God.

I am with you. My love is with you beloved souls. We carry you forward. You are never alone. You are never alone, beloveds, and truly loved. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls, precious to all the angels and to God. God bless you.
