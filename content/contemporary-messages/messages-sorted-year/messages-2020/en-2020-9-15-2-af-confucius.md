Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Confucius received by Al Fike

I bring to you a blessing of healing. I am Confucius. I touch each of you with healing balm to bring you peace and upliftment. I cradle you all, precious souls, for precious you are in the world, precious indeed, as you continue to struggle to reach God, to find light and peace and truth in your lives, to be loving and dear to God. So you are dear to us, beloved souls. So you are dear to us and we love you. You are lights in the world. You are beautiful and you are loved. Each soul here is precious. Each soul has many gifts to give, to express in the world.

Know that God will utilise all that you are. A soul bright with love will be a soul that gives with Godâ€™s blessings to many. Precious souls, be in the light. Work for God to bring greater light to your world for we have great faith in you. We continue to see the awakening, the brightness of your souls shining forth, the dawning truth within your minds and consciousness of God and His Truth and Love. Blessed you are, beloveds, blessed you are upon this journey to God.

My love for you, my love for you, precious souls, God bless you.
