# Soul-Healing

September 4<sup>th</sup>, 2020

General Collection, Swakopmund, Namibia

Seretta Kem received by Helge Mercker

It is Seretta Kem and I greet you this afternoon. I come to bring my love, to bring the required healing and to bring teachings on healing. It is the soul healing you ponder, the healing of that part of you that is in the process of being cleansed, and will eventually be changed and transformed by God’s Divine Love. Through prayer and opening to God’s Love comes the healing and harmony that brings one’s soul to a place of at-onement with God and His great soul. The healing process is incremental, for the part of the soul which has to be cleansed is reconstructed to its state of purity; or in the case of the Divine Love Pathway, the soul is incrementally changed into a new construct of soul, and becomes a soul of divinity in God’s Love.

The healing that occurs on the soul level will be reflected in the spirit body and eventually in the physical body. Observing your physical body you can deduct manifestations and outcomes of body functioning that are not in harmony with the normal energetic flows of the soul, that active part of the human that is the image of God. The building blocks of soul are not like the building blocks of the physical elements and thus it is difficult to see and sense the injuries or infirmities that are carried by the soul. Physical injury, illness and disease are widely studied by man and all effort is made to “fix” the physiology of the body as it is studied (and understood) by man. Furthermore, the more ethereal part of a human being, the spirit body, has also been studied and is understood by man. Using forms of spiritual healing, such as faith and energy healing, man explores and uses other ways and means to heal deeper levels of the human being.

However, the healing of the soul is not well understood and is still an undertaking of exploration, for how can you understand the healing processes of something that you have only limited knowledge of. Man is not truly engaged or aware of their soul-being as much emphasis is given to the mind, the material mind. In your world you speak of soul food and soul comfort and so the terms are used, but how often in the daily conversation do you speak of the (real) soul. For many it seems an abstract part of a person, and some believe it to be the consciousness of man etc.

We are speaking on the topic of progressing in soul development, in growing in soul awareness, and awakening your soul. Do you know your soul? What is the soul? These topics have been discussed in other messages and I will not delve into them at this moment, but maybe you can refer back to these messages that were given by our Master Jesus and others.

We will focus on the healing aspect as this is the topic your spoke about this morning. The healing of soul engages all aspects mentioned above, yet it is also something that can be focused on through desire and faith. As you know, God’s Love is the healing agent, the bringer and activator of many processes. It is the stabilizer of an inharmonious and imbalanced energy field. The power of this love and its healing force enables the required changes to that part of the soul that needs healing and cleansing, releasing those parts that defile and bring injury to the soul. You have felt how this Love changes a room of heaviness and darkness, filling it with an illuminating light, a cleansing breeze enveloping you, lifting you up and making you feel lighter. Imagine this room to be within your soul, relieving that burdened part that causes the disharmony or discomfort.

With repeated efforts of going to our Heavenly Father, the injured parts are slowly restored to a healthy state. Furthermore, through prayer and the receiving of Divine Love, an additional layer of change is generated, transforming the soul structure into a new construct where the building blocks are that of God’s Substance itself. God is Love and He gifts this Love, His own substance to you. He lays it in your soul and a magnificent creation, one beyond words, springs forth. For this process to occur the environment has to be conducive to the acceptance of this transformative agent. Thus the healing and cleansing of the soul advances the soul-structure to one that enables the change to occur.

We have written well my daughter and we will write more soon to come. I love you my dear one and we pray with you. You are right, Seretta Kem is here and so is Luke. You are interested in the “physiology” of the soul and its healing aspects and how to serve as a soul healer. My charge, continue in your seeking and asking. God is the one leading you to the source of Love and Truth. God is the source of all. God bless you dear beloved child, and bring forth your prayers with greater intensity and a burning desire in your search for truth. We love you and greet you. God bless you.

Beloved daughter I am here, Seretta Kem.

I wish to write further on the prospect of receiving healing of the soul while being a mortal on Earth. It comes with a desirous heart in longing for the Father’s Love and His touch upon the soul, filling the soul with this gracious gift.

By making a request for healing, asking God and having faith and trust that healing will occur, the human will experience changes in behaviour, in both the physical and mental outlook, shifting from discomfort into greater harmony and wellbeing. The Father’s Love is the healing agent and such healing prayers for oneself or others are very powerful if offered with sincerity and deep soul longings.

By clearing the pathway to reach God’s ear, a response will be certain. The acceptance of the healing that is applied and the embracing of the healing energies will assist the free flowing of the healing required/desired.

My communication is straining and we will try again at another occasion. God bless you dear child. Seretta Kem loves you.
