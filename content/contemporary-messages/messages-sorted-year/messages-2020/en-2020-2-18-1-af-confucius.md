Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Confucius received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my little birds, I am Confucius. I come to bring to you a blessing, a blessing of Light and healing, to uplift you and to sustain you. Walk in the Light of God’s Love always. Seek His blessings upon you. Always have within your thoughts that God’s Hand rests upon you, each one. As you journey in life, so God will bless you. As you face the challenges of life, so God will uplift you. You are His children. You are loved deeply. You are in the Light of His Touch as He brings Love and peace and joy.

Little birds, fly to the highest realms of His blessings and seek the great gifts of His Soul, given to you in the form of Love, trickling into your soul, transforming and healing all that is a part of you beloveds. So much can be given when you are open, when you desire this, when you pray for the gifts of God upon you.

May God bless you. I am Confucius and I have come to bless each one of you. Truly you are precious and you are blessed, beloved souls, blessed indeed. God bless you. So many good souls, so many bright souls. Blessings to you, beloveds, blessings indeed.
