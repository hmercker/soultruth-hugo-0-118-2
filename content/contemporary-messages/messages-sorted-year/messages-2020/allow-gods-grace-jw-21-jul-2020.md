# Allow God’s Grace

July 21<sup>st</sup>, 2020 

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Care. In the flow of God’s Love, the ocean of His Grace, the living waters, allow the current of God’s Grace to carry you. Be not concerned for others expectations and judgements, only open your hearts and your souls to God’s Love and their needs will be met. How I prayed for this guidance and to stay in this light in His Love. As I talked to God: *“Father please open the door, Father please keep me in Your love, Father please light the way.”* For I was in the human condition as you are and I struggled and God provided me with the perfect mate, one who supported my mission to the very end of my time on earth and beyond. 

You have all the support of the Celestial Kingdom at the beckoning of your souls. May God keep you and bless you and heal you as you allow the power of His love, the glory of His Grace to be yours. I am Care. God bless you.
