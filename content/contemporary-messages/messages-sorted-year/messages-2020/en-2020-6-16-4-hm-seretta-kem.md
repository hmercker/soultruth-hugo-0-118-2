# The Magnificence of Faith

Seretta Kem received by Helge Mercker

My dear daughter, I am here. It is Seretta Kem. Good morning and I greet you in the blessing of this new day.

As I have brought you the words, *“to recognize the magnificence of faith,”* I wish to elaborate on this topic. As you know, a cornerstone of our path to God is faith. You also know the saying that, - *“faith moves mountains.”* And so it is. Let this sink deep into your awareness and realize what faith is and how it has brought you to where you are today.

In faith we awaken. Through faith we open our souls and have a knowing of the Love received from our Heavenly Father. Faith lets us explore places within ourselves knowing that truth wishes to reside in each of us. Truth and untruth about oneself cannot exist side by side within us and thus one of them must give way. Hence, through the action of faith and explorations of our inner self we come to see the truth about ourselves. Receiving Divine Love does its part in removing aspects of untruth (encrustations) as well, assisting us in the process of realisation of our true soul being. Thus, through little steps of honest reflection, and a burning desire for truth and God’s Love, the eyes open to see clearly who one truly is. It is in this awakening and realisation that one’s own soul comes to the forefront. This is all based on faith and you can see that there are many examples of faith being the driving force in coming to certain outcomes.

So, we wish to encourage you that through faith all your projects will come to fruition, provided they are in harmony with God’s Laws of Love and Creation. As we have mentioned many times before, our help is assured, but you have to bring your faith, your trust and most of all your love and intention for the truth of God’s Love to come to all.

I have shared many messages through different mediums and I will share many more, bringing our support, words of truth and love. For you are to trust in what is given, to have faith in the Truth of God’s Love and His Presence through all that we bring. Yes, there will be influences by the medium’s minds upon reception and *“translation”* into words, but in general, the flair or overall intention of our messages, of our coming should be taken into consideration. The analysing mind tries to dissect the words and how it was expressed, instead of feeling the resonance within the soul. As you do the research and translation of many messages, convey the love that a message brings, the caring wisdom, the logic and simplicity of a truth or teaching. Nothing is complicated in God’s Universe. It is the human mind that tries to impose complicated deductions and conclusions upon material, excluding consideration from the soul that is made in the image of God or awakened in God’s own substance.

Thus, faith brings this extra understanding of a Truth noticed and coming from the soul. Having faith in that which bubbles up into your awareness brings a knowing that it must have come from somewhere within, and with faith comes the ability to discern when we (spirit) impress our thoughts, and when something comes up from within you. The clarity of this discernment comes in time and does not appear overnight.

In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the importance of faith, not from the mind, but faith from deep in the soul. As you know, having faith comes from the soul in contrast to believing. A belief encompasses the option to change, while faith does not, as it is a deep knowing, a knowing with certainty. Thus, have faith that the Father’s Love pours into your soul when earnestly prayed for. Have faith that you are guided and protected by the heavenly angels. Have faith that your soul is awakening as you feel the shifts and changes in yourself, your attitudes, your desires, your heartfelt wish to be with God all the time. All these changes and processes were initiated through God’s Love and your faith. Thus, my daughter, keep your faith and reflect upon the wonderment of faith, the significance of faith and the importance of faith.

Many words are spoken in your world to encourage others to believe. Teachings and movements are built on beliefs, however, the journey of Truth is built on faith. *“Love and faith are two sides of the same coin”* are words that have been written, and indeed, love goes with faith and faith goes with love, hand in hand.

We have written enough for today and I am happy to be here with you in this early morning hour. I will come again as I have much to share. For now I give you my love, my dear soul. I love you and I am often with you and the wider circle. Much is coming my beloved child and know that we hold your hand and walk with you, just like love walks hand in hand with faith. Seretta Kem loves you deeply and all whom you are connected with. God bless you and keep you in His Love. Seretta Kem greets you and loves you.
