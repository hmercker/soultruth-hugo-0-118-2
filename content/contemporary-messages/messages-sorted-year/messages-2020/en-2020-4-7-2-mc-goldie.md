I am Goldie. To the dear brother, our beloved instrument who shares his gift of sound and music with many, we would like you to know that we sing your songs up in Heaven. *“Oh Holy One”* is a favorite song that we sing. It elevates many here on Earth and in the spirit world. We are overjoyed that you share the gift of your soul and the music that you receive. It is a beautiful gift and I come to say that we sing with you. Many, many sing with you. God bless you, dear one.

I am Goldie and I shower each of you with joy for you need joy. You need to feel joy in your life. God bless you. I am Goldie.
