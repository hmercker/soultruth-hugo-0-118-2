# This Communion can be Yours

June 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am your brother in Christ and your friend Francis. I have stated many times that I went from a worldly life to a very simple life - in harmony with nature and in prayer to God and removed from the world for a time. During this time on Earth where you have been somewhat removed from the world at large, the opportunity to go into your souls, to go into prayer, to make things simple, has been yours. 

When I considered when I was quite ill if I should leave the Earth that day what in fact could I take with me, what would I want to take with me and what would I wish to leave behind. I allowed this to inform my walk into the future. And since the many things of the world that I had indulged in did not bring the happiness and up-liftment and joy that I sought, it was not difficult to leave them behind for the glorious communion of souls of my brothers and later the sisters. Walking in nature, living simple, praying for God’s love this communion can be yours. 

This community connected around the world which you have the benefit of, what a gift to each other and what a blessing it is. You come together in this prayer, in this circle with the longings in your hearts, in your souls to receive the greatest gift of God’s Love. And as much as you allow it, believe me you shall receive it. May it lift you up sustain you transform you. This is the Grace of the Gift. May each prayer connect you to the Celestial realm and the Love of God. May it be yours. And so it is. 

I am your brother and friend in God’s love. I am Francis
