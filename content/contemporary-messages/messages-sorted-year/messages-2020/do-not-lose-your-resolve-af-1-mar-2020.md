Received by Al Fike



Beloved friends, I am Seretta Kem. I am pleased that you continue to gather together to sustain and to help enhance the possibility of this gift being realised in your world. It is important that you continue to keep this thought and desire and intention alive within your minds and your souls. Just because you have not sat in circle for this gift in the flesh does not mean that the development of this gift is not taking place, for it is. It is indeed a part of the great plan and efforts of we in spirit to bring the truth to humanity. 

We are saddened because so few are willing to take up this call, to be a part of such a venture. Yes there are some who say that they can and will, but in truth, it is difficult to sustain this because of factors within their lives. Not that they lack intention, I should say to do so, but their lives indeed present roadblocks so that they cannot. But for you brave and consistent and dedicated souls, you continue upon this journey and venture. You continue to seek, to grow within your own souls. You continue to take seriously the call to do so. You continue to sustain within your minds and souls this intention to serve, to be a channel of Love and Light and Truth for the world.

May you not lose your resolve, my beloved friends. May you not forget this commitment that has been made, but continue to walk the path that you have started to walk upon together in unity, in love. Do not let any obstruction hinder this, but to have faith that you will indeed complete this journey and complete the possibility and Godâ€™s desire that the gifts, that many gifts, will manifest through you all. 

Though the conditions in the world are changing and there are threats that may be imminent, there are problems that seem at times insurmountable, and conditions that continue to challenge you all, I say to you, it is your faith, your dedication, and your desire that will pull you through any circumstance that may be manifest in your lives, inhibiting this work and flow to realise gifts for the good of mankind.

My beloved friends, continue upon this path. Continue to dedicate yourselves with forthrightness, integrity, a desire to be in harmony and in the flow of love, through all that you do, singly and together. These things are important. It is necessary that you not lose sight of how very important these efforts are. There is nothing that can indeed sidetrack you from these ventures other than your own desire to do so. 

Walk with love in your hearts, my friends. Walk with a knowing and sense of God close. Walk with a deep desire to receive His Great Gift within. Know that we continue forward. We have never stepped backwards and never will. For you have an army of angels with you, beloved souls, assisting you in this great project, helping you to continue to seek and rise above into light.
As long as your commitment is strong, so the benefits and the effects of the blessings of God upon you and the angels surrounding you will continue to be with you every moment, every moment, my friends. There is nothing that can stop you. There is nothing that is left undone. There is only the journey forward that is informed by your deep desire to grow within your souls, to be true to God, true to your own true self and be in that flow and harmony that is God's Touch upon you, guiding you, protecting you, loving you and nurturing your souls.

May God bless you upon that journey, my friends. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. Know that I continue to be the one who is helping you to safeguard this gift and to bring it to fruition. I continue to guide and support, to love and nurture. I am your friend. I am with you, never to leave, always to be by your side. May God bless you and keep you close to His bosom in Love and Light. God bless you. Seretta Kem loves you.
