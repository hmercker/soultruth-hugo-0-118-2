James received by Al Fike

I am James. The world needs to awaken to the soul, that part of each individual, each of your brothers and sisters, each of yourselves that has been so long neglected, unseen and unheard. It is time to awaken to your soul, for it is the soul that will lead humanity towards greater harmony and light. It is the soul that contains the wisdom, the love, the connection with God that is needed at this time to dispel the fear, the darkness, the confusion. It is the soul that will give each and every individual the strength that they need to traverse the waters of darkness and error into light, that new place, that dawning place of light which God has prepared for each soul that they may open and receive God's gifts, the bounty of God's gifts meant for each soul upon your world and upon all worlds.

Could you imagine a world where every soul is awakened, where the perspectives, the perceptions, the understandings of the soul may be clear as day to each individual, that they may come to know that deep and vital part of themselves more fully, that it will become a vital aspect of life not just hidden in the corner, not just languishing for lack of love but alive and well, awakened and true? Through the blessings of God's Love, so this shall be. Through the power of God's Love, so the soul will awaken and all its faculties, all its vitality, all the gifts of the soul, the perceptions of the soul, the mind of the soul will come awake, that you will walk as a complete person for so many are only partially awakened and do not truly know their full selves.

The time comes for all to walk upon a path of light, to be in harmony with God and God's Laws of Love, to release all burdens and obstructions to this, and be freed by the integration of soul and mind connected, seeking at-onement with God. All these things may come to each of you and all of humanity provided you open your selves to the way and the means of doing so. Allow yourself this possibility of freedom and joy, of peace and love, of wisdom, of gifts yet unrealised, of aspects of yourself, beloveds, that remain dormant but seek to be alive and a part of you. Seek your souls. Seek that deep place. Trust that you may and will do so in your prayers and contemplations. Your soul awaits you and God awaits you within your soul.

God bless you, beloveds. I am James and my love is with you all. God bless you. God bless you.
