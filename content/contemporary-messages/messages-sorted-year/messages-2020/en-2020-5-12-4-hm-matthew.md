Matthew received by Helge Mercker

My daughter, I am Matthew and I bring you my love and greetings in this morning hour.

“Resolution of conflict” are the words you have already picked up on and I wish to speak of this. The easiest and most natural way of facing a conflict amongst friends, family, community or even amongst countries and cultures, is to go into prayer. This is the first thing to do. In the earnestness and truthfulness of a prayer, much will be dissolved. Human emotional impulses can lead to a reaction and oftentimes mechanisms of the mind will be given free rein to respond in accustomed patterns. One has adopted these “survival skills” as a method or way to interact with one’s environment.

But, as you all have experienced, once you enter prayer, a bond is made with the Father who awaits your words of concern, hurt and pain, your seeking of His comfort, wisdom, and Love. Whatever the reason may be for seeking this connection to our Heavenly Father, quickly things seem to dissolve, and peace and clarity floods into one’s awareness. The reason for the initial cry dissolves and seems to dissipate, becoming removed from one’s consciousness or emotional awareness.

Oftentimes the material mind does not feel satisfied and after a while starts to analyse and dissect the many issues a conflict brings and the cycle can begin anew. The repetition of habitual patterns is easier, so it seems, than making a conscious decision to let go and remember that prayers have re-established some sort of balance, enabling a neutral view on the situation. It is so much easier to approach others in a gesture of soulful love and balanced wisdom. Therefore, seek and go to prayer as often as possible to find clarity of soul before entering into situations of conflicted opinions held by people who in their hearts, truly do long for love, acceptance and inclusion.

My daughter, you know the way and continue to find peace through prayers, through longing for God’s Love. Much is given through this, and much clarity of one’s own responses is given. Bless you, and all of you who seek peace. God bless you and Matthew is with you.
