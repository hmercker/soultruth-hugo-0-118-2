Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here Care.  I came in when you were speaking about me and my life and your feelings about passing over, losing loved ones to spirit, having to let go, and yet never losing the thread of love when it is meant to be.

If you go back in your memories and think about all the events of your lives that called you to prayer, that brought you so to speak, to your knees, asking God for assistance, for a healing, for a way forward when you saw none, for protection when you felt none, and here you are now, unscathed in the balm of the Father’s love, and in the protection of the Celestial Angels as promised.

In your world, there are beginnings and endings, and rightly so. In spirit there are beginnings and endings, but it is different because an ending is always the beginning of a progression into love, into light, into harmony, unending in eternity. Oh, my dear ones you are so loved. And the Father’s love for all of us is, as the song says, *“like a million suns in the love that makes us one”* with Him and in each other’s spirit. There is great peace in your future, and this will be illuminated in yourselves as your reach out to the world from a place of radiance, the light of your souls no longer hidden and revealed to all. This love you wish for, wish for all, bring to all, as we bring to you, in the embrace of our Heavenly Father. Let there be joy and song and dance. What have you got to lose eh?

As you say, “lighten up”, I did. It is my wish for you. Be in peace, be in grace, be in God’s embrace. Bring your light and love of God to the world. You will not regret it.

I thank you. I love you more than you know. I am your sister, I am your grandmother, I am your friend, I am your beloved. I am Care. God bless you!
