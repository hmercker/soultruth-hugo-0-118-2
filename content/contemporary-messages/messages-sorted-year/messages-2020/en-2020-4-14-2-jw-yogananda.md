Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here Yogananda. I come in the Divine Love of the Father as your brother and friend. Allow the peace and silence of this prayer to open your heart. Allow your souls to reach out to God’s Love for the Creator’s Love and Light is there for all to receive. There is no greater meditation than the longing of the soul to be at one with its Creator.

I encourage you to let go of all else for in the great blessing of God’s Love, all things are given, all wounds are healed, all doubt falls away. With this love comes Faith. With this Faith comes wisdom and understanding and the great glimpse of eternity beyond this Earth. For the Love of God carries the seeds of eternity as the soul is transformed from the mortal to the immortal, from the human to the Divine. So now I join you in this prayer in this opening to the great gift of God’s Love.

May all be blessed and transformed in this great joy and in the glory of Grace. I am your brother and friend in God’s Love and I shall always be. God bless you. I am Yogananda.
