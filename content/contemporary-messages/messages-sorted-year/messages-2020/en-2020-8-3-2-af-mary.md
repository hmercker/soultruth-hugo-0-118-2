…my beloveds, my beloved's, I am Mary. May you come to know the peace that passes all understanding, that God’s Hands may rest upon you, that you may feel His sweet embrace and know His Gift of Love for each one of you. Whenever you feel alone, call upon God to be with you. And when you pray for this Gift of Divine Love, know that the angels of Heaven will be with you and God, in His comforting emanations of Love, will touch your heart and bring you to peace. The power of this Gift, the power of the knowledge of this Gift is what will carry you through any and all conditions that may be within your life. The power of love, of God’s Love, will give to you the insights, the knowledge, the strength, to be able to meet any challenge, any situation that is difficult so that you may know the way through, you may come to that place of resolution, of peace, of harmony; your souls resonate with Love, opening to God’s Gift.

The Truth of this Love shall be your guiding Light,  and you will find your way upon the path that God has designated for each of you in this world. Such gifts, such gifts come from the Heavenly Father, raining down upon you bringing peace, joy, Love.

God bless you beloved souls, I am Mary. I am with you. My love is with you. God’s Touch of Love is with you. God bless you. God bless you all.
