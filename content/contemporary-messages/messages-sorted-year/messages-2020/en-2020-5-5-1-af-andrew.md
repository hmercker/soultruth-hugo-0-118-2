Andrew received by Al Fike

I am Andrew. Blessed are all of you who are lights in the world. In this Circle of Light, you are like a necklace of pearls, God's beautiful creations filled with light, coming together in a Circle of Light. God will continue to guide you and draw you together in this way, so that you may indeed drink of these Living Waters that you may indeed come to the Fountainhead of all Love. For, God is nurturing each one of you, drawing you in, drawing you into the Light, inspiring your souls to open, to put aside all your worries and cares, fears and doubts, so that you may be in this great Light and bathe within it, in this Light releasing all that may hold you from God. For, God's greatest wish is for you to come into this blessed Circle, removing those clothes that are of the human condition and being purely in Light, receptive to His great Touch upon your soul.

May we all come together today, beloved souls, in innocence, in hope and desire and longing for the great gift that is God’s Love to enter our souls and uplift us from all the earthly conditions to a place of grace and peace, beauty and light. Open yourselves, beloved souls, to the Greatest Blessing of all. Know that you are loved. Know that you are presently in God’s Grace. Know that you will be blessed beyond measure in the Great River of God's Love.

Shall we be together, my beloved friends, and drink of this elixir that shall ensure that we will be with God for all eternity and know the joys of His Love that is boundless, that will carry us into greater happiness, perception, love.

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Andrew and I pray with you. God bless you.
