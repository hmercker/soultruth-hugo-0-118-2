# The Importance of Circles of Light and Our Callings

December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Dear gracious souls, may His Love continue to flow into your soul awakening all of those beautiful parts that lie within you and seek to be awakened, yearning, yearning for your acknowledgment, allowing those aspects within you to be integrated and become a vital part of you. I am your teacher Augustine and I come to say that it is important that you gather together in these Circles of Light for the changing of your world, the healing of your world starts with the individual who seeks truth, who seeks the Touch of God.

One person, one soul awakened, could potentially awaken thousands of souls. Together as a great Circle of Light, you bring through a great light into the world. This light is influencing many, many souls. I know that you cannot see or perceive this but I tell you, you are instruments of God bringing about transformation and healing in your world.

It is our desire that throughout the world there will be nodes of light which manifest from the efforts of those individuals whether they be a small gathering or large but that there be a singleness of purpose, a desire to beseech God and receive His blessings into your souls, into this world. As these nodes of light grow, so the lattice that you speak of and pray for will grow, so these great Portals of Light will be established in the world, so the world will be enveloped in light by the efforts of the children of this world of yours seeking truth and seeking God and bringing forth the blessings of the angels and the Hand of God upon you all.

So you see, my beloved and beautiful students, you are an integral part of God’s salvation for humanity. You begin the process, the awakening. Though each of you individually may feel inadequate, singular, and not particularly powerful in the world, yet you carry a great power. You carry a light, the light of truth. As such, you bring a torch into the world that is the signal that change is upon us, that the truth of love will be spread amongst humanity. It is not your responsibility to change the world. It is God beseeching you to pray for the world and pray for your own souls that they may be transformed by the gift of the Father’s Essence, awakening, healing, and transforming.

In this way, you become an important node of light in the world. You become a channel of love in the world. You seek to be together, to forge the bonds of love, to support one another, to say to your brothers and sisters, *“I live this truth and I recognise that you live this truth and as such, we are brothers and sisters in this truth.”* As you continue to forge this relationship and feel a sense of belonging one to another, so this core of light will grow and expand and proliferate throughout the world.

God has begun with you, beloved souls. Though you may wonder why, I say to you that each of you who are dedicated to this truth have come to this world with the knowledge in your soul that you will be God’s instruments to bring the Truth of His Love forward, that you will do so because within you is a deep desire to fulfill your purpose, to fulfill this dedication that you have made to God and declaration.

Beloved souls, each of you is a light. Each of you continues to grow in the light. I urge you on. I urge you on. Wherever you may be, bring the Light of God to your soul. Allow the Light of God to do its work within you and thereby you may be a great and pure channel of light, love, and truth to the world. God will inspire you, invoke you to move in the world as His channels of light. This will come to be. It is destined to be, provided you are willing to adopt the Will of God and allow it to usurp your own will in a way that the guidance and knowledge that God wishes to give you, that you may listen to and awaken to so that you will know what it is that God wishes for you to do as His instruments.

These things come to each soul. It is subtle at first. It is not so much a great shouting of guidance and direction, rather, a subtle and gentle inclination towards the road that God has destined you to walk. As you continue to walk further upon this road, so you will feel the pull, the guidance to carry you forward. So you will be inspired to reach out to many other souls for it is important that this truth come to many, that the awakening of humanity must spread and grow and bring the flowering of the great potentials that God has placed within each of His beloved children.

You are given a great blessing, a beautiful opportunity to serve in light, to be truly God’s children in light, to be that example of light and love and truth. I urge you forward. I urge you forward upon this great path of Love so that you may carry this truth wherever you go, that your light continues to shine, that your words may be words of truth and love and dedication to your brothers and sisters in service. Be that child of God and truly awaken to your destinies. Truly come to accept that God has indeed given you a mission, a calling to bring the truth forward in the world.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine and I come to bring to you clearly and succinctly the message that you are called, that God wishes for each of you to listen and abide by His Will. God bless you and keep you in His Light. I continue to walk with you all as do many who are my colleagues in the Celestial Heavens, a great effort to help heal humanity of all this unnecessary suffering and pain and darkness. It must come and will come with the children who are God’s beloved channels, seeking to know His guidance, His Will, channels of love. God bless you. God bless you all. My love is with you.
