Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Judas, and I will be brief because I know you have schedules and time in your world but for me it is a but moment’s notice. 

Jesus asked the disciples to love God with their whole being with their whole heart and to love their neighbors as themselves. And furthermore, he added that God’s Love for us was paramount. When you are grateful for God’s Love you are not only are sending your love but allowing God to touch your heart and your soul with His Love that is reciprocal. God bless you. I am Judas. God bless you.
