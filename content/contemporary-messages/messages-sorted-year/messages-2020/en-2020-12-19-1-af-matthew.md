Lightbrighters, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Matthew received by Al Fike

The will of God is always with you, beloved souls, I am Matthew. It is for you to know the Will of God and you understand the ways and means which you may know the Will of God. It is the opening and development of your soul in God's Love, so you will come to know what God wishes for you to do, what is within God's plan for each one of you. Today you have listened to the Will of God, have you not? You have made effort to gather together, to acknowledge your brothers and sisters, to say I am willing to come together in harmony and work together in harmony with God's Will and plan, and that it is the Divine Love, the power of Love that is awakening me to these possibilities and opportunities to serve humanity.

You are upon a great path. Though you walk this individually, you are also together as a family of love and truth. Remember this, beloved souls, even when you find some disagreement, some conflict of personality, some misdirected ideas, those things that may hold you back from your associations with others. Remember this,  you are a family of God's Love, His embrace amongst you all and you join all of us, we in the Celestial kingdom and all of the spirits in the spirit spheres, who are joining together to continue upon this journey of souls' awakenings and blessings of God's Love.

It is only the biases of your minds that will hold you from your dedications to one another and to God. But I assure you that God wishes for you all to come together in harmony and love, to support one another in your ways and expressions of the soul, teaching your brothers and sisters, teaching and demonstrating the truth of God's Love. This does not mean to be, nor meant to be complicated. It is meant to be powerful, simple, gracious, and undeniable as our dear brother spoke of this in his heartfelt expression, that in your world the truth of God's Love may be an undeniable fact and that this truth may be available to be known in a conscious way amongst humanity, all humanity, every race, color, creed, religion, every aspect of humanity, that you may have the blessing, the grace, the gift and the opportunity to bring this truth forward in ways that will inspire, in ways that will bring other souls to God. It is for you to discover those ways, beloved souls. It is for you to know your own soul and to express your own soul in the world.

I know this is a continuous venture and struggle and that you come to milestones in this effort to awaken your own soul. Each of you have great potentials, beautiful gifts, even those that you realize now are merely a shadow of what can come with a soul fully awakened in love. Know that you are all a work in progress and that all of humanity is a work in progress and that you may make your contributions to assist humanity to move forward, to be upon a path towards greater light, greater wisdom, and greater truth. May you dedicate yourselves to this service in whatever way is in harmony with your individual life that you may dedicate yourselves to serving God and in so doing recognize that you are amongst your brothers and sisters, this great company of light that shares your desire, that is a part of a great movement, a wave of change and truth and upliftment that continues to unfold in your world. For this is God's plan, bringing all of humanity towards the light, giving each individual the choice, giving each individual an understanding, an awakening that there is indeed a choice, there is indeed the opportunity to express themselves in light, to find a life that is in greater harmony with God's laws in this world of yours.

Such a great venture and a great challenge beloved souls, but I tell you with each of you the angels are there to accompany you in this great effort, to uplift you and protect you. God is guiding you forward. God's desire is that with each day you might uncover a little more of your own souls, to awaken to a deeper place, to have the wisdom of your souls, which often contradicts the ideas of your mind, informing your days, your journey and your efforts to serve in love. It is crucial, to awaken your souls, not to take great pride in your mental acuity but to take great joy in the wonderment of your own soul, that beautiful kernel that reflects God and is waiting to be nurtured and blossom in love so that what is hidden within your soul may emerge and come forward and be wondrous in its unique creation.

You are each individuals and yet you share the great gift of life and you share the great gift that is God's Love. May you come to acknowledge one another in this powerful truth and in witnessing each other upon this journey of soul awakening. Together we will accomplish much, beloved children. Together we will be God's instruments in the unfolding of His plan. As Love continues to intensify and pour upon your world so you will be nurtured. All that you require will come. All that it is in the flow of God's Will and plan will be realized provided you are willing to go beyond the strictures of the mind to the freedom of the soul.

May God bless you on that journey, beloved souls. We have great joy to hear you, to see you, to know you as the beautiful lights that you are. What a beautiful light you have created together! May God bless you, beloved souls, bless you deeply. I am Matthew and there are many with me at this time who share my great joy in your accomplishments and your efforts and your desire to serve in light and truth. God bless you, God bless you deeply.
