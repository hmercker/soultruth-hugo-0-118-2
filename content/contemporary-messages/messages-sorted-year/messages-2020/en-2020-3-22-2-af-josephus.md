Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Josephus received by Al Fike

Beloved and blessed souls, I am Josephus. I have come to reassure you all that God’s Hand is firmly upon each one of you. None of you are forsaken by God nor lost to His great flow of Love and influence upon your lives. You have chosen to seek for His Love. You have chosen to find the answers that are within your own souls, reaching forward, reaching to God, seeking His Touch, His Wisdom, His Love. You shall not be forsaken, beloved souls. Never shall you be forsaken. As you continue to exercise your faith, to come to God in prayer, to take time to contemplate these deeper matters of the soul, so you will be blessed and so God will bring to you the answers to your questions, the unraveling of the mysteries of life, and  truly know the power of love.

Too few in your world understand the power of love and the ways and aspects of love that humanity in its natural way may express, but also the soul in its relationship with God may come to know and express in their lives. So many aspects of the human expression are enhanced and awakened by Love. So many misunderstand the power of love, the capacity of love to heal, to bring harmony, to bring peace.

Instead, the baser human tendencies and expressions are much more familiar in your world. Love is not clearly a part of the human expression in everyday life. Instead, your minds continue to entertain thoughts of the material. Your emotions roil about in many expressions that are not of love. Fear seems to be the replacement for love in your world. At this time, fear seems prevalent and powerful in your thoughts, in your musings about life. Yet you come to these Circles of Light seeking healing and peace, seeking the Source of all Love so that you may be comforted, that your souls may be awakened and expanded in Love.

My beloved friends, you have chosen well. You are seeking the higher road than what is so common in your world. The events that are taking place and will come in future times will help to awaken humanity to love and will open doors of understanding. God will manifest great healing for those who have faith to go to God and receive this gift. God will show the way to the redemption of the soul, to the blessing of His Essence flowing within. God will bring solutions to many of the dilemmas that humanity faces at this time.

For those who go to God will be mightily blessed. Those who seek God will receive all that God has to give, an abundance in power and strength and Love. God wishes to give to each human soul the Truth, the opening way that will awaken each soul. His Love pours upon you all. His Breath will awaken you. His Truth will come to your consciousness so that you may utilise all of these things that God has created for your benefit. God does not withhold from anyone but will give abundantly to those who seek.

So you must seek God’s Blessings. In this time of turmoil you must seek ardently and with great focus and intent for your prayers will open the doors to all that which I speak of my friends. There is little that holds you from God at this time. Take advantage of those blessings, the great abundance of Light that is flowing upon your world. Utilise each moment wisely. Bring yourself into harmony with God, close, close so that you may come to know in a deeper way what it is that God wishes to bless you with and to awaken you with, that His Love may flow and wash over you and wash through you and enliven you with this Holy Light that is His Touch.

God bless you, my friends. I am Josephus. Thank you for gathering. The world needs your prayers. You need your prayers. May God bless you in accordance to your prayers. God bless you.
