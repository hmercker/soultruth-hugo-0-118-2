I am here Francis. What a joy to see this gathering of souls longing of souls longing to be one in God’s love. This is not a path of the mind but rather one of the heart. To paraphrase our dear brother Luke: *“where your heart is so there is your soul, and when the heart longs for the Creators love therein is your treasure.”* There is no higher love there is no greater gift. It is a simple path to allow your heart to open that God may touch your souls and bring His love into each one, changing you, healing you.

As the dear sister said in her prayer: *“we have all strayed.”* I too in my time on earth had quite a life exhausting my physical desires and pleasures until I came to a place where I knew I could not continue on that path and ever find happiness or joy. This was the beginning truly of my deep prayer for God to heal me, for my will to merge with His. And then everything became clear and simple. 

All these things I had stored, all the wounds, all the guilt, and all the un-forgiveness, was transformed in God’s love. So, you see, it is very simple. When you hear: *“follow your heart”* there is wisdom because it leads to your soul and the deep longings you all have to be transformed. So many here today with you in this beautiful circle of light. 

I leave you with all my love and blessings. May God bless you and change you as we are truly one in His love. I am your brother and friend Francis. God bless you.
