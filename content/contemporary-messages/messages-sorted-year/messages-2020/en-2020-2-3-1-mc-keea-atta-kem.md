# It is Important for New Mediums to See the Gradual Development of Other Mediums

Mediumship Workshops, Abbotsford, BC, Canada

You draw me near, beloved souls, yes, in your conversation early in the morning, discussing the work that is before you gathering the souls to discuss the topic of mediumship and what this means upon the divine love path. As you continue to step into your work and you continue in your prayers for the Love of God to awaken your souls, this gift continues to transform your soul and strengthen your gifts.

One part that is essential as your gifts continue to strengthen and awaken, is the idea of continuing to go deeper into letting go, letting go of the mindful constructs around your gift and how at times the mind can interfere through its insecurities of being able to be a clear instrument and channel for God and the Celestial angels through this mediumship.  What we see before us with these three mediums whom we speak through frequently, is a varied and graduated stage in their development.

This is important for the public to see. It is important for these mediums to recognise the Grace of Divine Love and its workings upon the soul. For when there are others upon this path who share the same gifts that are being utilised by the angels to share God’s Truths, it gives one another a great support. It shows others the humanness in ways that the medium is challenged or being asked to freely let go as their gift is being utilised and we are speaking. To embrace the soul and to allow this expression in our ability to strengthen in the rapport, and the communication then becomes very clear.

It is an important step and an awareness to be mindful of these growing stages of the gift. As the instrument continues to trust and faith continues to grow, they become a clearer channel for the Celestials to speak freely through and the words flow more fluidly. The meaning and the depth of the message is felt by the instrument which then also helps to relay and convey the essence of the message more deeply to those who hear and read in future times the messages that we speak.

So to all those who wish to serve their gift of mediumship to whatever degree that is, whether we utilize the voice, the soul ,and the mind of the medium to speak in ways that I am using at this point in time or whether it is an inspiration given to another to guide someone that is before them, it all requires of deepening of letting go and allowing the channel, the instrument, the instrumentality to be used more fully and freely.

As each of you continue upon your journey of receiving the Essence of Divine Love, this shall be the case. Incrementally, the journey undergoes the awakening and the facilitation of the gift becomes clearer as the faculties of the soul awaken more deeply.  It is a journey that we encourage you upon for we require those beautiful souls dedicated to the awakening of their soul in serving the Will of God to serve their brothers and sisters.

We applaud each of you for your dedication. We continue to be with you to inspire you, to uplift you. We hold you to a high standard of living, one where you have the awareness your soul in the forefront of your consciousness and giving your soul the opportunity to influence your thinking, your habits, and your actions. For deep within your soul is the ability to help you to walk your earthly life in light and in love with great compassion, understanding, and ability to speak the Truth.

Continue to commune with your soul, calling forth its wisdom in guidance, for your soul is gifted with this Love and stores much wisdom by the Grace of God. So you have within you, answers to your many questions. We ask you to move deeply into this part of you, into your being. Go to your soul rather than your mind for guidance and you will find the answers. As you continue to develop and strengthen, this way of being in your life, you will see that the times are fewer where you struggle to know what to do for your mind consciously goes deep within your being to receive the wisdom of your soul.

My beloved friends, continue walking your Earth life with the depth, the wisdom, the knowledge, and the truth of your soul within your consciousness. I am your friend, your guide, and your teacher, Keea Atta Kem, who is so pleased to have this building rapport with this dear instrument whom she has sensed is with her often. Together we have an extraordinary journey, teacher to student whom I will walk next to for many years sharing and teaching the Truths of God’s Love to her and through her. It is a blessed journey, one that we will traverse the world together hand in hand, sister to sister, soul to soul.

God bless you, beloved friends. May your souls receive the deepest inflowing of God’s Love filling you mightily, continuing to wash every wound and hurt that may rest upon your soul. May your light continue to beam forth as you awaken in the Grace of God’s Love.

My love is with you. I am Keea Atta Kem. God bless you.
