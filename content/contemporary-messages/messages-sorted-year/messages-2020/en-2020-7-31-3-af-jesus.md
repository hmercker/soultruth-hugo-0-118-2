Jesus received by Al Fike

Precious and beloved souls, I come. I am Jesus. I come to call you forth, all who have a desire to serve humanity and serve God. To step forward in light and declare yourselves as God’s instruments of light and love. For within the hearts of all of humanity is a sense and knowing of deep change that is here and will continue to unfold in the transformation of your world. God is calling all his children to open their eyes, to come to know their true selves, to come to the Source of all Light and Love, to seek the succor of the soul so that all may be awakened and come into harmony with life.

God has created for each child the potential and possibility to live a life in harmony in joy, in truth, in love. It is for each child to seek this, to seek the way of this. The true way to at-onement with God is to receive His gift of Love within their souls. May you come to seek this gift more earnestly with each day that passes, to be touched deeply within, that the warmth and Love and joy may become a conscious reality of your life. No matter what may come in your material world, this strength, this Light, this Love will sustain you. You will come to know a greater reality, a deeper truth, a more important journey of life that is the awakening of the soul and all its potentials therein.

God is using many to bring the Light to your world. There are many millions of spirits and angels who are working diligently to inspire humanity so that they may rise up and take that step towards greater Light and Truth and Love. Though there are few on your Earth plane who are willing to look, to be a part of, to accept this invitation from God. But this grows with each day and it grows with your efforts in prayer and it grows with your efforts to be with one another in prayer.

Continue with your efforts, beloved souls. Continue to speak the truth. Continue in your work. Each of you have been inspired in some way and are growing within your soul, are seeking greater truth and expression of light and love. Continue in your efforts. Yes, the manifestations of light, of high spirits and angels, of truth spoken and delivered directly, will come about for God’s Will must be done in this regard.

Each of you hear this, this small but powerful voice within you as God continues to speak to you and encourage you to express your gifts, to be of that higher spiritual nature that each of you can be and has the great potential to be a bright light, a beautiful light in the world. Do not doubt yourself, but feel a calling from God to be with Him, to be in harmony with all that He is, all that He has created, all that is within you that is a light. Walk the path of Truth. Carry the Light of Truth. Be a channel of love.

We will walk alongside you, beloveds. I am with you always. The children of God who reside within the Celestial Kingdom are intent on uplifting and supporting you all. You are known to all the Angels of Heaven, for you have ignited a light within you through your prayers and this brings with it great blessings and benefits as you continue to seek the Truth of God’s Love. Know this, beloved souls. Know that you step foot upon a powerful path, a path of great Light and Truth, a path of great service, a path that will lead you to great opportunities to uplift your brothers and sister and to be in greater light with each foot fall, with each decision that you make towards Light, each effort that you make to unlock your soul and release those conditions that keep you from God.

Much is being given to all the souls upon this world. Some will hear the pealing bell that is God’s invitation to step forward in Light and some will not. But rest assured that when all is transformed and blessed, that this world will once again know deep harmony and light, will be a place of beauty and love where your progeny will live in far greater harmony than is present at this time in your world. You do this work for your children, beloveds, and you do this work for your own soul. Many will benefit by your dedications, your prayers, your efforts, and your light.

God is with you, beloveds. I am with you. We are all with you in this great journey of the transformation of your world into light. God bless you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens. My love is with you all. I know you all, each of you. I know your souls. I know you and I love you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
