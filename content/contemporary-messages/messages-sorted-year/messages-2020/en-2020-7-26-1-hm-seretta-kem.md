# Awareness of new Life

July 26<sup>th</sup>, 2020

General Collection, Swakopmund, Namibia

Seretta Kem received by Helge Mercker

My children, we embrace you in our love. We come to be near and answer your calls for love, support and help. We have come to tell you that the Father’s Love is living actively in your souls and with each day the life of Love takes new forms and shapes, ever growing in new awarenesses and awakenings of who you truly are. The Love of God is the agent that brings about the many realizations that lets you grow close to the source of this Love, this wonderful and gracious Gift.

With the awareness of this new life within you, this growing awareness and existence of Love, closer attention is brought to one’s inner life. To sit in silence and prayers, contemplating God’s Truth and all the many wonders as you mortals call it. It is this new life within that needs attention, gentle caring and nurturing. Prayers, as you know my dear child, is the coming to the fountain to drink the nourishing waters of living, strengthening your being and bringing you to deeper understandings and greater peace.

Pray my daughter, pray to God, our beloved Father, for His Love to infill you continuously, as we pray with you, with you all, who seek to be near Him.

I am Seretta Kem and I come this afternoon to bring my love and encouragement to hold each other in this new awareness of being, in this coming together in a love that each of you have received. I come again, to bring you teachings on healing and God’s truths.

God bless you, and my love is with you dear daughter and all that you are connected with. God bless you. Seretta Kem loves you all.
