# God’s Dancer

December 9<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Hafiz 

God in His infinite patience awaits your arrival 

In His grand ballroom 

with all its magnificence

And yet you and your partner

dressed to the nines

Have chosen the Poverty of Spirit at the Paupers ball  

No, not that poverty where you feed the hungry 

with the bread of life

With the wine of Divine Love 

in The Eternal dance

But that impoverished ball of endless distractions 
succumbing to all those things

You believed you couldn’t do without

And yet when you arrive at the Creators dance

you will wonder

and be amazed  

And say: *“why did it take me so long to get here”?*

And as you step out on the floor to dance with the Beloved

You will merge with every dancing planet 

Spinning in Joy 

Like the whirling Dervish

You are

God’s Dancer
