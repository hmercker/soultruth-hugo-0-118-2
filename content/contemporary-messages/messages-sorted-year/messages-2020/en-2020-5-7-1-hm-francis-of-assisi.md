Francis of Assisi received by Helge Mercker

My daughter, listen to the soft wind, feel the warmth of the ocean breeze. Listen to the sound of palm leaves swaying in the wind. God blesses you in your prayers. I am with you in your prayers. Yes, it is Francis, my beloved child, Francis of Assisi is what they call me. A man who lived in service to our Father in Heaven, and to our brothers and sisters, destitute and hungry. I am your friend and brother in this service of love. I am here now as I have been with you often as you know.

The love is ever flowing from our Father, to all in need, to all in prayer, to all who cry for love and comfort, and seek relief from their suffering and pain. I am by your side dear daughter in your prayers for all your loved ones, near and far, to receive the blessings of healing and comfort. May the Love of God touch each soul prayed for and may we all feel His Touch.

I walk with you, dear one, and I bring my love and my songs, my joy and happiness. Yes, the birds are singing when the children are fed, and as you gather in prayer under the trees. The birds are singing of the promise of another glorious day. And as the birds are singing their songs, our hearts open up and our eyes look to the Heavens, to sing the praises of our love and dedication, of our joy of life and the beauty that surrounds us. Sing my children, sing and let go of any pain and suffering. God embraces you in His Love, in His warmth. Be comforted as He sings through the birds a song of love for He will always care for each of His creations. It comes as one feels the touch of His Love ever flowing forth, touching and reaching all whom He desires to reach. Light-bringers of earth, channels of love, watercarriers of truth, bring your gift, bring the blessings to all whom you can reach. God guides you, God reaches you. Embrace this knowing in your soul, reflect the Love you gained through your life of dedication to prayers for the infilling of His glorious Gift of Divine Love. Seek to live this. Bring it to all you meet. Show the direction toward the fountain, the source of the waters of everlasting love, peace and harmony.

*“Gracious God, we pray for all the children, for all who long for your Love. Open up our souls as we come to you Dear God, and pray for Your Love to infill us.”*

Bless you my daughter, I am glad you started to write, and I can come and bring you my love and support in the development of our communications in this manner.  You recognise my presence easily and you know that I am often with you, my dear child. I will come again as I long to be with God’s children who seek His Love. Bless you beloved soul, God bless you. Francis is often with you. God bless you.
