May God’s love pierce your souls, my beloved friends. I am Moses. I come for the dear daughter who is new to this idea of the path of the redeemed soul brought to humanity by my brother Jesus who is the great Master of the Celestial Kingdom. All through the history of the Hebrews, God has blessed us and guided us. Indeed there is a covenant between us and God that we shall follow the road of Light towards the one great God, the Creator of All. 

Many times my people have beseeched God to deliver them. In many ways God has delivered them and brought their needs forward in Love. At times they have not recognised the ministrations of God for as all peoples on the Earth, they are human and their perceptions are flawed. Yet many carry a deep faith in the Creator of All. Many anticipated the coming of the Messiah but when the Messiah came, they could not recognise him for he did not represent the expectations of the Jews at that time. So a few recognised him and followed him but many did not. 

Yet this invitation from my brother Jesus continues to this day. Follow the path of Love. Follow your heart. Follow the wisdom of your soul. Follow the yearnings of your soul to be with God, to be in alignment with God, to walk in the Light of God. These things are not unique to the Jews, not unique to any religion but unique to each individual who inhabits your world for within their soul is a longing to be with God, to know God and to be uplifted in Light. 

So with the Jewish people, there were leaders who guided many to such alignment, helped to guide towards Light and were inspired by God - prophets and teachers - those dedicated to Truth. Like those days long past, humanity today is lost and seeking for solid ground. So God is in need of leaders of men, of spiritual insight given to all who will listen and to be channels of love as Jesus was and still is. As all of us who now recognise the Truth that he spoke and gave to his people and to the world, we follow the path of Love. We have come to understand the power of Love, the Grace of Love, how Love may transform your hearts to that of purity and beauty and Light. 

So I beseech you, all of your brothers and sisters, all the spirits that surround us at this time to continue to pursue the Truth, to find it in your hearts, for this is where Truth dwells, not within the mind for this is where those conditions that draw us away from Truth exists so often. But the surety of Truth within the soul will always uphold and bring clarity.

When the soul is awakened with the Essence of God, the Divine Love, the perceptions of the soul, the knowings of the soul, the wisdom of the soul and the gifts of the soul will come to the fore and will come alive from this Holy Touch from God. In this way you truly become God’s children and you rely upon God’s Holy Touch and guidance for each one of you. Do not shrink away from the powerful Hand of God but be upheld, strengthened, and blessed. You will find yourself in realms of Light, in joy, in deep abiding wisdom and Love. 

These things are manifestations and food for the soul. It is the soul that must awaken in humanity. For too long humanity has relied upon their intellects, their material perceptions, their judgments and their desires to guide their way in life and unfortunately has come so often to pain and disharmony. Now is the time to change the road that all must take, to see clearly with those God-given perceptions and wisdom that abide in the soul, to see the road forward in Light. 

God means to transform this world of yours, to reclaim it from the condition of men and to heal it from the transgressions of men so that it may once again be a paradise from which humanity may grow and flourish and truly become brothers and sisters and children of God. This is God’s plan, God’s intention, and God’s Will will be done upon your Earth. God’s seeks those who will comply and seek to be guided in this way so that they too may be God’s harbingers of Truth and change, of harmony and Love. Light must again flourish upon your world. The time has come.

Each soul must be awakened. God will bring that which is needed to awaken the souls. As God guides you, so He will show you the way to the many souls who are hungering, who are in need of your strength and wisdom and truth. Seek to be guided, beloved souls. Seek God above all else. Seek to be His instruments. Seek to be teachers, leaders, prophets and channels of Love and Truth. As you seek, so God will guide you, bring you what you require to manifest His Will through you. 

Nothing will be withheld from His children. All will be given in good time, in harmony and in accordance to your own will, beloved souls. Choose wisely with each day. Walk in Light with each day. Seek to uphold your own truth and light and soulful desires so that you may be with God and feel the Grace of God and know the powerful Hand of God upon you.

You are blessed, beloved children, with the angels of Heaven, with the Hand of God, and a soul eager to be blessed and to know Truth. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Moses and I come to encourage you all, to lay before you a road that is of Light and blessed by God. May you walk upon this road and do so with great faith and trust and desire. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with you. God bless you.
