Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am your teacher, Augustine. How it uplifts our hearts to see each one of you step upon the Path Divine and that each of you are reaching out to your brothers and sisters saying, *“Come join me upon this beautiful path as we walk towards God, as we feel His Light shining upon our souls.”* How joyful it is that we all walk together this great journey of discovering our souls and discovering the Great Soul of God. How blessed are we that God provides the ways and means for His children to help one another upon this path, to be a part of a great family of Love that has within its heart great compassion and desire for all to partake of this great bounty of Love. How powerful is the journey of awakening the soul. The beauty that lies within is beautiful in its Light, it bedazzles us as we continue to awaken to this Light; and how we come to humility, that sense that we are all equal in God's eyes, and beautiful; that His Touch continues to emanate and bring us comfort and Truth and joy. How joyful it is to know that we are loved deeply, profoundly loved; that each one of us is a star in God’s heavens; that as He continues to awaken us, so our Light shines brighter and our beauty becomes such a blessing upon the world.

How we love you dear and beautiful souls, those of you who have overcome the barriers of this human condition that is in your world, and made that commitment, that decision to follow the journey of the soul, to be strong in God's Love, awakened in God's Truth, expressing one's soul in a world that does not fully appreciate the wonderment of the soul. Yet you shine forth, beloveds, you shine forth with all your Light. With all your beauty and grace you shine forth and show the world your testimony of Love, your love of God, your love of life, your love of yourself and your love of your brothers and sisters. How beautiful this is.

Bright and blessed souls, you carry the deep Truth that is God’s Love for all and you shall share this Truth with many. Once their eyes begin to open, they shall appreciate your Light and comprehend the Truth that you have to give. God's plan for the awakening of humanity continues to unfold, and you are some of the first to awaken in this way, responding to His call. You have heard the bell toll and you have responded with your hearts. You have opened your soul to God, and you have come with humility, with deep desire, with your pains and your struggles. Yet, you have come to feel the fulfillment, the upliftment, the power of God's Love. It shall redeem your souls and bring them into at-onement with God.

What a wondrous journey it is, beloveds, what a wondrous journey indeed. And we are all together upon this path, brothers and sisters all, seeking to be reclaimed by God, seeking to come to know our true selves, to come to know that place where you and God are together in harmony, in Truth, in Love. What a wondrous path it is, and we continue to walk this path together, hand-in-hand, hearts aglow with Love and acknowledgment of the wonderment that is God’s Creation.

May God bless you upon that journey, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine, and I continue to walk with you, my hand outstretched to all who are willing to join me in this wondrous journey. God bless you. My love is with you. My love is with you all. God bless you.
