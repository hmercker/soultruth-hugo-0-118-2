Paul received by Helge Mercker

Yes, it is Paul and I desire to write.

I come to you my sister to write about the love, the true love that brings us happiness and joy beyond description. In the blessings of the Father’s Love, the Divine Love, much is revealed and accomplished. My coming to you is driven by this love, as I bring my love to you, and to all who seek God in their longings and prayers, as they strive for His Love and comfort. We bring our love to you in your prayers and in the work that you do for the benefit of all our brothers and sisters, spreading the word of truth, the word of God’s Love. The benefit of your reaching out to others is reciprocal, for love comes to you as you connect with others in love. Keep praying, lift your spirit to the highest, bring your thoughts to an elevated, pure and innocent state, and love in truthful, kind and generous ways, and the most precious of all gifts will be yours.

When I lived on Earth, my sustenance was prayer. I lived prayer. It was an important part of my daily routine, the bread for my soul. Prayer is the longing of the soul to reach  God, to reach our Creator, our Heavenly Father. Prayer is the doorway to the magnificent touch of warmth, love and light that is created as the connection to our Source of All becomes stronger and stronger.  The receiving of God’s Love brings the insights, the peace, the calmness, and the expansion of oneself as one reaches out to others.

In this reaching out we, the angels, touch you in profound ways, in healing ways, in comforting ways. As we reach you and touch you with our love so it expands, enveloping you with our presence of gentle benevolence and solicitude. The bringing of our love elevates you and helps you to reach a purer state of receptivity or openness, and an alignment of greater harmony and peacefulness.

Your prayers vary depending on your emotional condition, desire and purpose of prayer, on the glow of warmth and love within you, and on your heartfelt wish to be in communion with God. There are many influences affecting prayer and the manner in which you pray. Through experience you know how different each prayer is. External factors, the condition of mind, the condition of soul, and influences of thoughts and emotions all come into play. Thus, we ask you to sit quietly for a while before entering into the soulful connection to God in order to let go of these external and internal influences and fluctuations, and slowly sink deeper into your true, inner being, your soul. In this soulful state an easy connection to God is established. The ways and means of coming into this state of soulfulness vary and each individual will eventually discover the best way for them to reach this deep, soulful state of prayer.

The hungering souls and yearning souls look for a way to connect to their Creator  -the fountain of Love - to be replenished and strengthened in their search for love, comfort and healing. These are the souls who need to be taught how to pray, how to yearn for the love their souls seek, and how to pray soulful prayers.

The topic of prayer has many facets since prayers are as varied as there are souls, yet it is one of the most important aspects of your journey in life. You know of prayer, so pray with others, teach of God’s Love and how to obtain It and live It.

My love is with you. God bless you, I am Paul and I wish to continue my discourse on prayer. God bless you with His Love as I pray with you. God bless you.
