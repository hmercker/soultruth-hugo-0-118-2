I am Yogananda, your brother and friend here to join you as you take a break from the world and allow the longings of your souls to reach out for the Creators love. In this period of time, in this slowing down, where so many are released from the mortal coil, from the physical body into spirit, where all will go permanently at some point. Realize the freedom to be above the worries, the troubles and the concerns of this world, as you pray to receive this love Divine and you feel the presence of God’s Grace and light around you. To truly feel this is to have a glimpse of Immortality, have a glimpse of Eternity - a glimpse of the vastness of God’s creation and the love that transforms each soul. When you relinquish the body, allow the soul to be present above the mind, above the world, with the longings in your heart, your soul and so precipitate the blessing of God’s love. 

So many have come into this circle of light today it does not matter the reason. What is the joy is in seeing the coming together, the desire of each soul to be at One with its Creator. Fear not. This change upon you however great, is a door to Eternity. And through that door a light is descending from the Celestial heavens to the earth. To see this would be like if you look at a constellation far away in another galaxy. And those here in the Celestial Heavens in that light in that galaxy looking down upon you on your beautiful planet where now the birds are singing, they’re not worried, the sky is happy, the water is clear, there is rest and peace. This time of transition of the earth brings each of you into the glorious opportunityof the transition of your souls in God’s love. We are with you on this journey and we rejoice in the Presence of Almighty God and glorious love, His essence bestowed upon each one. 

Go in peace, rest in this joy beyond words, and know you are so deeply loved. May God bless each one in the transformation of your souls and this communion in this moment where you reside. God bless you! All my love and blessings to each one. I am Yogananda.
