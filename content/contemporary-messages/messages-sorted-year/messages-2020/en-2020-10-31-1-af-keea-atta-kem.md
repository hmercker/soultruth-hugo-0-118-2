Dearly beloved souls, I merely want to comment that many women will be involved in this great effort and project. For it is often the women who have spiritual insights and great sensitivity and they may present various journeys of truth, ideas and insights in a softer ways that will encourage others to explore these avenues and to be comforted and uplifted and encouraged by the feminine perspective. Although I'm sure many men will be involved as well, I am excited that women in your world will find wonderful opportunities through this university as you call it and they will find deep satisfaction and spiritual gratification in this work.

So much is coming. Be prepared, for when the floodgate opens there will be many who will want to participate and become a part of this great movement. Because of the interest and desires of those who are wanting to be a part of what you are doing, I caution you that it is important to be clear as to what the goals are and what it is you wish to teach. For as you know, within this world of yours there are many ideas and many pathways to spirituality that are endorsed by various teachers. One can be swept away by the power of these individuals and groups that are eager to use the avenues that you have created to teach their philosophies and yet this is not our goal. We do not  wish to dilute the truth of Divine Love with many other teachings and ideas as many of these things are of the mind and not the soul. Indeed, it is important to reaffirm over and over again that you are teaching that which is of the soul, not necessarily of the mind. This is the primary focus of your efforts if you are to be guided by we who come from those places of soul awareness and soul redemption. Though there are things that are helpful indeed to bring a soul to consciousness, stripping away those dark conditions of the mind and the encrustations around the soul, the biases and fears of the mind. All of these things need your attention and efforts, but the purpose of engaging in these ways and means of healing and purification are to point the ways of the soul in relationship with God and to open up greater perspectives and experiences in this regard.

This will take some wisdom, some finessing, some strength and compassion. But indeed we get a little ahead of ourselves with this guidance for this will be some time in the future. But for now, you are forging ahead and making your ideas something more tangible and practical and beautiful. Know that we are with you in these efforts. May God bless you deeply in your efforts, beloved souls. God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem and I come to you with great love and joy and admiration for your work and desire to serve humanity. God bless you, God bless you dearly.
