# All is Moving Towards Greater Harmony

April 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Francis of Assisi received by Al Fike

I am Francis. There are many angels with us today bringing with them many blessings and spiritual gifts for each one of you, drawing the energies and blessings from heaven and the energies and blessings from your Earth. For, your part of the Earth is in its spring blossom, bringing an energy, a blessing of vitality that is emanating through the Earth and can be harnessed by the angels to focus upon you all. As for the blessings from heaven, beautiful colors are bathing you all, sapphire blue, beautiful green, gold and white, butter yellow, pink and many other shades, like a rainbow of God’s Touch upon each one of you. This will help you in your bodies, your minds and your spiritual nature. These things are given to you as gifts as you continue to draw to you the many blessings of God.

So we answer God’s intentions as God hears your prayers and responds with these blessings. Through you, many of these blessings are flowing to your loved ones, to those in the world who are in need. All together, we create a powerful force in your world with God blessings, many through your intensions of prayer and desires to see healing and upliftment and Truth bestowed upon many. Your prayers, together in unity and love, bring a response that is wondrous in its beauty and miraculous in its depth. The gracious Touch of God is flowing, ever flowing towards you and into your world.

The animals and creatures of your world too are benefitting from these blessings. For, as the world continues to experience shifts and changes, cycles dwindling and new rhythms beginning, so the animals are feeling this difference and are more sensitive than most of you on the Earth to these changing conditions. As such, your prayers for the world must include the beloved creatures of your world.

All is moving towards greater harmony and yet, there is an adjustment, a time of some confusion and inability to reflect the natural order of things. Many of you are also sensing deep changes, not just those things that are manifesting so overtly at this time, but deeper things, things of the soul, things of the spirit. Thoughts are changing, intentions are changing, and your focus is changing. This will continue, my beloved friends. So many things are happening at once that it is difficult to comprehend and assimilate all of these things that are in motion in your world. This is why you must be of great faith and pray often, so to gain your equilibrium, to be grounded in God’s Love and Touch of Light, to be wholly in the Light of God.

My beloved friends, know that we are with you, that you are never alone, that you are all embarking upon a great journey of soul-awakening, of harmony, of existing in your world in harmony with God’s Laws of Creation, the manifestations of God’s Creation bringing greater Light and great happiness to you all. There is joy in this, my friends. Look to nature and see the rising manifestations of God’s Love for His Creation coming to life, coming to greater beauty, coming to greet you and say: “Yes, God is here. God loves you. God loves your world.” May you see through the eyes of your spiritual self that which is so beautiful in God’s Creation and so beautiful within yourself, a whole garden that is your soul coming to life with the blessings of God, His Touch upon you all.

God bless you, my friends, keep you in His Light, keep you enwrapped in Love and peace. My love is with you. many are with you in their love. God bless you and keep you. I am Francis. God bless you.
