Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here and I am your brother and I am your friend and your guide on this path. I am Francis. Blessed are you who pray for the love of God. Blessed are you who forgive those who have offended you. Blessed are you who reach out to the less fortunate. Blessed are you who do not judge, for God is the judge.

As you walk this world my brothers and sisters, if you could say only one thing to everyone you meet, consider what that might be? Let me say that in some cases it might be unspoken but delivered through God’s Grace in your soul. The time will come again when you may hug all those and hug them with the love of God. For now, during this time of tribulation, we are influencing all not only to pray, which is our utmost desire, but also to consider how much anyone needs to sustain their physical body, to live in comfort, or to be able to travel. 

We understand the requirements of food and shelter, being able to travel and (in your case), spread the word of God’s love embracing all. During this time, we also wish the world a healing and for all human beings to consider not only what is necessary in your world, but as I have said before, what you will take with you, and that of course, is your soul. As the master said: *“Store not your treasures on earth,”* but receive the riches beyond measure of God’s Love. This you know. My brothers, I encourage you to spend your time being love, speaking love, singing love, sharing love. This way you will be a blessing to all as you wish to be. How we love you, all the brothers and sisters on this beautiful path, whatever their differences, we support.

My warmest loving embrace to you and yours and to all. God bless you. I am your brother and friend in eternity, I am Francis.
