Andrew received by Al Fike

May God bless you my  beloved friends, that His Will will be your guiding light. I am Andrew. There is always so much to be considered in your lives on this Earth plane; so many complications, so many diverse energies and ideas that cross one another and often oppose one another. So you find comfort when you come together in this resonance of thought and prayer and love. As the Law of Attraction works and draws you all into a Circle of Light, a friendship, a collaboration, a loving effort in the world, often these things are guided by God. Often you find your way through hearing God’s Will and accepting the road which is laid before you.

In this dance of life that you take, at times certain souls come close and at times they are distant. This is the way of your world. But those souls who are truly an alignment with your own will always return and rekindle this connection and love bond that you have between you. Have faith that as you continue to grow in Light, as the Father's Love continues to flow into your souls, so you will draw many kindred spirits about you, individuals who are drawn by their soul’s longing, but may have diverse ideas which have been born from their unique experience in life. Beloved souls, embrace all. Do not judge, do not fear, do not become intractable in your thinking. Rather, be a loving channel for all, knowing with the wisdom of your souls that the thinking of an individual merely reflects their present ideas in reality which will change in time and be influenced by a growing soul that will bring truth to their consciousness.

Each of you have had your unique journeys. Each of you have your unique perspectives. In this way you come to realize with humility that each will indeed see the world differently, see the truth differently and see themselves and one another differently.

In this way, you do indeed dance together in this beautiful, eclectic expression of life. Appreciate the uniqueness. Appreciate the diversity. Appreciate your own soul and honor the soul of another. All comes together and is unified in love. All is healed in love. Error falls away in love. Truth comes to the fore in love. Have faith in love, have strength in love, be at peace in love.

God bless you beloved souls, I am Andrew and I love each one of you. Cherish your uniqueness, your beauty, the souls that you are, created by God. My love for you is great. God bless you. God bless you beloved souls.
