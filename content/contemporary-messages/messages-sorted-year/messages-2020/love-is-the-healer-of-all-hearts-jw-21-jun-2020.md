I am here your sister Clare. My three beautiful, kind friends these matters of the heart are always healed in love, the best medicine. To my dear sister who will undergo procedures in the coming days I encourage you to put your heart at ease, to listen to beautiful sounds in nature and in music.  I encourage you to distance yourself from any in-harmonies and in this measure I speak to all. Surround yourselves with love, beautiful music, nature, the beauty of God’s creation. This behavior will produce calm and peace and healing and facilitate a quickening of your bodies’ immune systems. This I give to all three for all have health issues. 

When you call you know that we come so please utilize our invitation to be with you, to surround you in light, to influence those you come in contact with and during any procedures we will be happy to influence those who are working towards your healing and facilitating those procedures. May all of our souls connect with God’s great soul beyond words and the longings that we hold in our hearts for the Grace of God to be at one with us. 

I am happy to be of service and you will all have many come at your beckoned call. Just remember that as we remember that God loves us in every moment and that love is the great healer. With all my love and blessings for my three kind mice. I bid you farewell for now but I shall be with you when you call. God bless you. I am Clare of Assisi.
