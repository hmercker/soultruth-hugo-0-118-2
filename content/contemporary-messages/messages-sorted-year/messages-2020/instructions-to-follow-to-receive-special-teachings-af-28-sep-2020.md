I come. I am Jesus and I come to speak to you. I wish for this instrument and for you both to set aside a morning a week for me to deliver important messages to the world. There needs be no distractions or pressures of time or conditions that are contrary to receiving these messages, so that we will enter into a sacred trust and endeavour to bring forth these messages together allowing the conditions of this beautiful place and Portal of Light to assist us in the delivery of higher truths. This commitment needs to be made consistently and in all seriousness and preparation so that the conditions within this place and within yourselves will be of the highest that you are able to attain. Let there be an eagerness in your soul to bring forth these messages and that there be peace around you and light and a deep desire for Love of God to impregnate every part of this place and every part of yourselves.

In this way, you will make it easier for us, for myself, to bring forth these messages. They will not only be brought forth by me but by others, others you are familiar with and who have a good rapport with this instrument. In time, it will become a publication of truths that will be given. Just as you have done so in the past, so you will birth a beautiful book of messages for the world.

May God bless you in these endeavors and bring you into alignment with this purpose,  allowing these higher truths to flow and become clear and powerful and inspiring to many. What has been said by others regarding the importance of prayer for Divine Love as the primary purpose in your work, this is indeed true but many are not yet within that firm endeavour and the practice of prayer and so often need encouragement and inspiration. Many are hungering for the truth and will be nourished both within their souls and their minds with truth given in love, given in clarity, given with a profound simplicity that all may recognise and be nurtured by what is given. 

Godâ€™s desire is that all may know of these truths, the truths of His Love, the Laws of His Love, the wonderment of His Creation that is manifest in Love and must be made available to humanity in many different ways. There are many who desire to be a channel for truth but are unable to make a rapport with we in the Celestial Heavens because they do not have within their souls the desire for this nor the Essence of God within burning away, influencing the minds of those individuals with great desire for truth. 

We have now in this instrument such a powerful alignment of qualities of mediumship, qualities of the soul, qualities of desire and humility that we are able to transmit truths clearly and effectively through him. So we must together dedicate a time and a place in order to do so. We will leave it to you to arrange this, to make it a part of your weekly rituals and routines. We thank you for your consideration and the blessing to you both in these efforts.

God bless you. I am your brother and friend Jesus. I shall continue to establish a deeper rapport with this instrument and with you both. As time goes on, you will come to know me with such a familiarity that this is as if I am with you in the flesh. In this beautiful relationship, this bond of love that we will share will bear much fruit and blessings. May God bless you, beloved souls, keep you in His Love, uplift you in His Love. I am here with you and my love is here with you. I am Jesus.
