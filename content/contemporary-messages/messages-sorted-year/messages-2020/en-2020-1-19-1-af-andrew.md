Andrew received by Al Fike

Bless you beloved souls. I am Andrew. We are the gardeners of God’s beloved garden whom He has seeded with all of you. Our duties are to nurture and help you to grow. We are available at any moment to assist you in your beautiful journey of awakening and flourishing in Light and Love. So God sends His angels to assist you and God’s Love for you is immense. God wishes to uphold and nurture every step upon your journey of life, both here and in the world of spirit. God is eager to bless you.

God’s Love, which is the very Essence of His Soul, may be given at any moment that you ask to receive it. In this way, all the great potentials and beauty that is within your beautiful countenance and soul may be awakened and flourish in Love. God awaits your prayer and desire to be blessed, to receive all the blessings and benefits that God has to give to each one of you.

May you come to realise the vast resources of the Creator. May you come to utilise the truth of this in your lives. May you be awakened, strengthened, that great faculties within the soul may open so that you may see more clearly, that the wisdom within your soul may come to your conscious self, that the Light within your soul may shine forth in this world, pushing back the darkness, pushing back that which would rob you from your joy. May you be blessed, beloved souls, upon your journey to Truth and Light and Love.

God bless you. I am Andrew and I am eager to assist you upon that journey. God bless you.
