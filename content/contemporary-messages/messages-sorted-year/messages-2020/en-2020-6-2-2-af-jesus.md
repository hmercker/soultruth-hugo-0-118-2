# I Come to Lift You Up

June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Jesus. I come to lift you up and to bring the comfort of Love that says that you are a part of my family, the family of Love; that you are gathered together, embraced by the angels, embraced by God’s Holy Touch upon your souls. You will continue to be uplifted, ever uplifted higher and higher into the realms of Light and Love, of grace and goodness. The blessings of God are with you. And in these blessings will come the gifts of the soul, awakened and shared with one another, as this dear daughter has shared her soulful beauty and light in song. So each of you will share your song with the others, a gift, a gift that is God’s Creation implanted within each of you, its unique beauty shared and recognized by the soul.

God bless you beloved souls. You are my brothers and sisters all upon this beloved and blessed journey of awakening the soul in God’s Love. I am with you. Many, many angels are with you to accompany you upon this journey. As my beloved brother says, hand in hand we walk forward in light, and so we shall; together, never alone, never singly, but together on this blessed journey. God bless you, beloved souls. I am with you always. God bless you.
