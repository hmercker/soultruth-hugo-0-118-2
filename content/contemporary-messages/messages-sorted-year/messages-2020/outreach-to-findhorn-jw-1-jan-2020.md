Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here, Eileen. Thank you for inviting me to your Circle of Love in response to my request to bring your prayers and your light to my beloved Findhorn. I am most willing to help you in this year of 2020 to give you clarity of vision as you focus on the great spiritual need of that community. This will require singularity of purpose and taking time to allow our guidance for you to be processed by your souls, by your minds and in your hearts. If you approach this with the love that is in each of your souls and the true desire to bring a blessing to Findhorn, you will not be displeased, for you will touch the hearts of those now who facilitate that community. Though their paths may be more ecologically material minded, they are not without soulful longings and they are not without a willingness to have open hearts to sincere requests.

So I say be truthful in your request, be specific if need be, but above all be loving. Share the love of God you have in your communication. I can hardly express my happiness to you all in this great endeavor because I know it can affect so many. So take heart, be not discouraged, be persistent in singularity of purpose. As I say above all, be loving.

I am here to help you in this endeavor as are many others. Ask and ye shall receive. I am your sister and friend in the Celestial Realm. I love you and bless you. I am Eileen.
