I am here your sister in God’s love and your friend, Care. I am here with Nirmala who was known on earth as Anandamayi Ma and Yogananda is here as are many others. They have allowed me to come forth and speak because they wish to honor you here in this circle for the work that you have done and continue to do to bring the truths of God’s Love to the world, to the many. As the dear sister spoke earlier, each one of you in your unique way does much to bring forth the Kingdom to those souls seeking something deeper than themselves. 

There is self realization which is discovering the beauty of your soul within and the oneness of God’s creation and the peace and the calm that comes with such a realization. Then there is God realization when the self reaches out in longings to be transformed, changed from human to Divine in Oneness with its Creator. You have discovered this great gift, this path that leads to the Celestial realms where we abide. We are so delighted to support you, to embrace you, to let you know we are with you. 

You have been given the truths that will carry you on the ocean of God’s Love to the realities of the Celestial Kingdom and the shores from which we speak. We are with you in prayer. We bring God’s Love in our souls and the guidance we perceive is needed at any given time. Those here with me do wish to speak and share with this union and they shall come again to do so. We honor you, we thank you, and we are most grateful for your work. We shall continue this journey with you walking in God’s Love that will carry you all to His Kingdom. Thank you. I love you, I am Care.

**Note.** Anandamayi Ma (30 April 1896 – 27 August 1982) was a Bengali Saint, described by Sivananda Saraswati (of the Divine Life Society) as *"the most perfect flower the Indian soil has produced."* Precognition, faith healing and miracles were attributed to her by her followers. Paramahansa Yogananda translates the Sanskrit epithet Anandamayi as *"Joy-permeated"* in English. This name was given to her by her devotees in the 1920s to describe her perpetual state of divine joy.
