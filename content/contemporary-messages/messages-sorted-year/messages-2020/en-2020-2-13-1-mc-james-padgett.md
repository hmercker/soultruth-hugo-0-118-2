# James Padgett on How He Received Spirit Messages While on Earth

James Padgett received by Maureen Cardoso

I join you in your Circle of Light. Many of you gathering here for the first time coming to experience what it is to receive the very Substance of our beloved Creator known as the Divine Love. My name is James Padgett.

I would like to share with you a bit of the history on how the message of the Truth of our elder brother Jesus teaches while he walked on Earth. And the deepest message that he had to share with mankind was to pray for the Love of God, the Divine Love to come into their souls, which begins to transform this soul of natural creation into becoming a divine soul filled with the very Substance of the Creator.

When I lived on Earth, I resided in Washington DC. I was a lawyer, not very much interested in things spiritual, but more dedicated to serving my clients with the work. Through various circumstances in life, I came to the understanding and the desire to reach for greater spirituality and meaning in my life. And I met various people who helped me with that. There was a time shortly after that I began to receive messages from spirit by way of automatic writing which was not of my own will that the pen moved upon paper. Rather the spirit was able to move the pen and generate messages. And to my surprise and often great doubt, these messages were said to have come from Jesus. And through me, he wished to bring forward teachings to correct those things written within the Bible that were not of Truth and bring forward these corrections and help us to learn about who we are as a soul. Many teachings about being human and what it means to receive Divine Love within the soul and the transformation of the soul.

His message, often to me privately, was to pray, to pray for this Love more fervently so that my condition, my soul condition, would have the ability to receive these higher teachings he longed to bring through for his brothers and sisters on Earth. I struggled in this way, and I often hid what was happening to me except for some very close friends who encouraged me and supported me. There were thousands of messages that I received, and these messages exist today, and there are volumes that each of you here may receive freely so that you can read in your own time and comfort of your home and come to understand more deeply the truth of who you are and the truth of your existence.

It is a beautiful journey coming to know your beloved Creator in your own unique way by receiving the Essence, the very Substance of Love. For you all agree that God is Love. But one can only understand the true Love to the degree that they are able to love. And what this Divine Love will do for you is to give you the capacity to love as God loves, which is without condition, which is constant, which has no judgments and which sees the beauty within each and every one of you. So as you dedicate yourselves to your awakening soul and receive this Love drop by drop, so you will change. Those wounds that each of you carry within you, those many hurts through your lifeâ€™s experience will heal. So you talk about healing yourself. We want you to help others to heal. This is the highest way. This is the most direct way by receiving this Gift of Divine Love.

God knows you so deeply and awaits you, awaits each one of you, to call out, to invite in and to build a most gracious union, a friendship. God wants you to know His Love in the most incredible and dynamic way that you can possibly experience. You seek the peace that passes all understanding.

That dear friends that you are seeking is Divine Love. I wish to invite you now to experience receiving this Love. Bring your attention to dear friends to your heart center. Let your mind rest there and within you, call to your beloved Creator with your words of love and ask His gracious presence to touch you deeply within your soul. I leave you now with my love. And may the grace of God touch you deeply while you sit in silence. I am James Padgett. God Bless you.
