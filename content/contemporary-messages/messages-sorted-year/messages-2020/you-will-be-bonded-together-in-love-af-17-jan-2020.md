Beloved souls, I am Jesus. I bring a blessing to unify you for together you will be bonded in great love and trust and fellowship with one another. Despite the miles between you, you will sense and know that you belong to one another upon this great journey of love. I bring a blessing to you so that you will know this truly and feel this great unifying love for one another. 

You are all precious to me. I will be with you as we continue our journeys together towards at-onement with our Heavenly Father, seeking His benediction of Love, walking in this Light. 

God bless you. My love, my love for you is great and I walk with you all. God bless you.
