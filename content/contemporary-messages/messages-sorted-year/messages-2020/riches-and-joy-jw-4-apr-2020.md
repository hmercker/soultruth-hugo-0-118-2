# Riches and Joy

I am here Clare of Assisi. I’m drawn to this beautiful circle. You may know me as the founder of the order of monastic women who became called and are still called the Poor Clare’s. We followed in the footsteps of my beloved Francis of Assisi and his brothers who had decided to leave much of the world behind and live the simple life. I address this issue because you are in a period now on the earth where you can contemplate the importance of material things. How much does one need? What is necessary? 

And deeper than that: *“What is that which brings joy to the heart, to the soul?”* Simply being able to go out in nature, or in your village what a joy! We had given up so much of the material things but we had food, we had shelter and we had the beautiful experience of living in nature and appreciating God’s creation at the same time as we prayed for the love of God to touch us, to change us and to guide us. 

And so you see there is not much that is necessary to maintain a simple life and actually what it takes to receive God’s love, to let go in any moment of your material attachments and just ask for the blessing, these things , these material things, fall away and you are given the richness and the glory of God’s love. Such a joy! Such a joy! 

Thank you for allowing me to come to my dear sisters and my brothers in God’s love. We are one.  I am Clare.
