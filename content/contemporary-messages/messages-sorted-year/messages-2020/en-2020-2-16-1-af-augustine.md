Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. How you long for the mystical experiences of God’s Touch upon you and upon your souls. How you long for manifestations and proof and expressions that are palpable of these gifts from God. How you want for your brothers and sisters to know from their minds’ perspectives, their senses, and their souls that gift from God, His Love, is true and real and knowable. How you seek to be used as God’s instruments to bring about such wonders and blessings to help your fellow travelers upon this road of love.

How elusive is this goal? At times, you are attuned and feel and know the experience of receiving this Gift, this Benediction from God’s Soul to your own in ways that are unmistakeable and powerful. Other times, you feel somewhat forlorn that such experiences are far from your grasp. Such is the way of your world, my beloved souls. Such is the way of your own condition and spiritual acuity as it is difficult to be consistent in these experiences and knowings. For each day brings with it many different conditions and sets of mind and energetic imprints upon you and soulful longings within you.

The way of the world is such that in the spiritual way there is little consistency, for the energies and conditions of your world swirl about you like the great forces of your weather and the energies of the world interacting and comingling in your daily experience of life. So it is with these conditions of your soul, your mind, your receptivity, your gifts and psychic abilities are interacting and swirling about, not allowing for stability and consistency.

Yet, within your souls, God’s Love is reaching forth and touching each of you. As you continue to pray and exercise your faith in prayer, so these gifts and blessings continue to touch your soul, entering those chambers within, and have their effects in transforming your soul, healing your soul, awakening your soul. It is difficult for your mind to reconcile these situations and blessings and acts of God’ Love and Mercy upon you. For the condition of the soul, the perceptions of the soul, the faculties of the soul are so different from those of the mind. Thus, to reconcile those two different perspectives is indeed challenging and often difficult. For as I have said, there are exterior forces which also influence this possibility of awareness and recognition of the blessings of the soul.

So, at times, it is like catching a feather in the wind, fleeting is this possibility of experiencing God in a deep and intimate way through your soul’s perceptions and recognition of the Holy Touch of God within you. So few times do you feel that great upliftment, that opening and awakening that brings to you those precious moments of dazzling awareness and knowings and blessings that change everything, that awaken your consciousness to something so much closer to Truth than that which comes with the mind’s reckonings.

Yet, these fleeting moments, so precious, so powerful are what you long for and desire to experience more often than not in your prayers. I say to you, my friends, as you grow in the Love, even for those of you who have great deal of difficulty understanding and knowing the states of consciousness and recognizing them, you will find your way to this mystical awareness of God. It will come in drops and drips to consciousness. But in time, the trickle of pure truth and awareness will enter your soul and that little brook will turn into a mighty river in times to come as your soul is affected by the purification of the Father’s Love.

These awarenesses of the soul brought about by the opening of great faculties within you, great portals of perception, great mechanisms of truly seeing and knowing God, which are awakened by His Essence flowing within, giving the impetus, the power to awaken these gifts that God has given you, these great potentials that continue to yearn to be alive within and truly a part of your experience of life. Your experience of your own true selves will come bit by bit, slowly opening, allowing you to adjust in your awareness of life, allowing your minds to accept these things as true and clear and valid. Allowing yourself to live in this material world without being so disoriented by the power of these gifts that it would make it difficult for you to live a life that is engaged in the material world.

Yet, we have said to you to be of the world but not truly of the world. To be free from those human conditions and energies and forces within the world that keep you from God and to walk in the world as a clear channel of love. Reaching out to all your brothers and sisters with deep compassion and understanding so that your touch upon another may be powerfully felt in the form of comfort and healing and peace and love.

So you grow within your souls and your souls continue to absorb the great gift of Love. In this, the transformation continues. Whether your minds are aware of this or not, it is a fact. It is a powerful Truth that you carry within your souls. It shall be awakened, my beautiful students. It shall be awakened and become a conscious and true part of your experience in life, your experience with God, your experience of love, and your experience of your true selves. For this must be the power of Love that continues to grow within you and awaken all that is within will burst forth into your consciousness and will be truly alive and deep, bringing to you new awarenesses, new Truth, new understanding.

For do we not call this the new birth? The new birth, beloveds, the birthing of your soul, bringing all that is new and all that is pure and sanctified by God, touching every part of yourselves, awakening new and unknown parts, giving to you deep insights and wonderments and Truth. For the great Flame of Love that is God’s Touch upon you will consume you, every part transformed, every aspect of your being changed, reconciled to God, brought to Truth, transformed from something that is human to that which is Divine.

You will each experience this transformation, beloved souls, and know the great mystical touch that comes with the awareness of the awakened soul. These things will come to you and are promised by God. A Holy Touch upon your heart and soul and mind bringing all together in harmony, awakening all in good time and measure as you reach for the highest blessing, the highest Truth, and the greatest good, not only for yourself but for this world. So you will be gifted. So you will be blessed. So you will know. I promise you. You will truly know the wonderments of God and the power of Love to transform all.

May God bless you upon that journey. I am your teacher Augustine and I have come to encourage and bring my love that you may know that I am close and with you often, as are many angels. So you are never alone. So we continue in this great birthing process of your soul, reconciling you to your Creator, bringing to you all that your souls long and desire for. May God bless you. Augustine loves you dearly. God bless you.
