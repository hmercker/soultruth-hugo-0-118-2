# Prayer is the Bridge Between Heaven and Earth

April 24<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Eileen, I am drawn to your prayer. For those of you who do not know me I was known as Eileen Caddy and I was the spiritual founder of the Findhorn community which not only still exists but has grown exponentially since it was started in the early 1960’s. It was started on a wing and a prayer from the guidance that I received. And what was considered a barren sometimes desolate landscape has become a sustainable, flourishing, verdant, beautiful community. We always respected the individual's need for privacy and the need for community. So, as we prayed to receive guidance and for the inflowing and infilling of the Creator’s love, we grew beyond our wildest dreams.

I share that with those here who during this time of the earth slowing down have the opportunity to consider what kind of future you would like to walk into for the rest of your days. Of course those of us in the Celestial realm we wish you to consider beyond your earth life, the future of your soul. As I have said before, prayer is the bridge between heaven and earth. So first and foremost, I encourage you to take time, find a quiet space open your heart that your souls may be opened with the great gift of the Creator’s love. And when you are in Grace and you have the connection to eternity you can then envision what you wish to do for the rest of your time here: *“Who you wish to associate with, how you wish to grow, what kind of community you feel drawn to?”* 

I can tell you the love in your souls will bring you everything you desire, in what you call the law of attraction also known as spiritual magnetism, and as the great Luke pronounced *“where your heart is therein is also your treasure.”* So with all my love I encourage you to follow your heart and be aware of your soul’s desire. Allow this great transformation, this great gift, to be yours. For it is given freely to each one for the asking.

I am your sister and friend and I love you each one. May God bless you! I am Eileen
