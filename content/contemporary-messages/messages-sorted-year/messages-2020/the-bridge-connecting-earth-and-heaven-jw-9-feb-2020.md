I am here, Eileen. There is a bridge that connects the realities of the Earth plane with the realities of the Celestial world and spirit. When one is from the Earth plane and has come to believe that that is all there is and that they shall return again and again and that within the human condition problems can always be solved in mindful ways, they do tend to get solved, but the recognition of the bridge to the Creator gets obscured.

I have asked for you to go to my beloved Findhorn and to present the bridge. It has not been lost, it is just obscured. The way to reach out through the soul is through love. No one there can deny the truth of the foundation of Findhorn in love and in guidance. You can stand on that rock because you present it with the love in your souls. So do not be intimidated. Stay in your soul. Look at what is required and respond in love. I will guide you in this because it is so dear to me and I know that your intentions are nothing but good and in Godâ€™s Love.

Yes, community is important, so important to get us through these Earth changes. But even more important is communion of souls in the Love of God. For the real destination is beyond this world, as you know. Speak with love, write with love, sing with love, walk in love. You cannot fail. I am with you in love. May God continue to bless you and may you all know you have the support of the Celestial Heavens in the work that you do. I love you.

I am your friend and sister in the Celestial Heavens, Eileen Caddy. God bless you.
