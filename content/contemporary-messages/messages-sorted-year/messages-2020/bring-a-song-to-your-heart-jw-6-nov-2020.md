# Bring a Song to your Heart

November 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Clare. My dear sweet friends I have a request of you. Should you find it difficult to pray, to be in harmony, to stay in the Love of God and His bountiful light, bring a song to your heart. Sing if you can or listen to someone who lifts your soul. This is important, for a beautiful song can be a prayer. A beautiful song can bring your soul much delight. Consider the Psalms of David and all the songs that you loved, that brought you comfort and peace. Essentially, I say to you: *“Stay tuned to the Divine channel, and the music of love, and the words of love, so that you may be lifted above the troubles of this world and that your love be a force, a healing force, an emanation and vibration from above in the Grace of God.”*

You are in a beautiful circle of light and many angels are with you in this moment. Be still with us.  (long pause)

Allow your hearts to open wide that God will shower your souls with Love Divine, the most precious gift in the Universe.  All Glory to God on High! 

I leave you with my love and blessings always. I am your sister in Christ who once walked the hills of Assisi. I am Clare. Go with God.
