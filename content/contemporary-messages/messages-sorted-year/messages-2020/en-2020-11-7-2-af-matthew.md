# Consider Your Steps Carefully

Matthew received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Matthew. It is indeed important that you consider each step carefully, that you consider your motivations and your thoughts which inspire the actions which you are about to take. It is important to look upon oneself and divine that which is clear and that which is obtuse that you carry within you. Your souls will guide you, beloveds, your souls will guide you. But you must first listen and pray and consider so that you may be guided in the right direction upon the path designated by God.

Humility is essential in this regard. Rather than try to express those intended words of the mind, go deeper within yourselves as our dear brother has suggested and seek to express those desires of the soul. This is what you will teach in the coming years. This is what is important to understand and for all of humanity to know, that the wisdom of the soul is greater than that of the mind, that a soul in alignment with God will come to know the road to take that is in harmony with God's Laws and God's Will. Therefore, harmony must come from whatever actions are inspired by the soul. Resolutions of any kind, any need to bring harmony, will come directly when the soul is engaged and awakened and comes to consciousness. When one comes to their Creator and asks, how may I serve you, how may I serve my brothers and sisters in love, then there will always be a response provided that this question to God is sincere and is replete with true desire to do God's Will.

Each of you faces many challenges in life as do all peoples who walk the earth. Not a day goes by when you are not distracted, challenged, where you must bring yourself back to that place of light and harmony. Though, compared to many in the world, it is not such a daunting task, but indeed you must be conscious of the challenges that you face and how your daily experience informs those conversations that you have at this time. Look clearly, beloved souls, pray sincerely, be in alignment with God and in this way there will be no great obstructions upon your path. There will be no missteps that cannot be corrected easily. And when you come together as you do you will support one another in such harmonious and deep ways that there will be a joy, a sense of rightness and purpose that will come with your conversations and your efforts.

The unfolding of God's Will is not a complicated matter. It only becomes complicated when the mind becomes dominant and wishes to overshadow the simple wisdom of the soul. Be aware of this, my beautiful charges, be aware that much will come when the alignment is established and the true purpose of your efforts is revealed clearly and decisively. This is coming, beloved souls. You continue to ask the right questions, to seek the right answers, to go within yourself and humbly consider how you may serve God in this way. When love is the predominant factor in all that you do, then harmony must be the outcome.

May God bless you upon this journey, beloved souls. The words will come, the understanding of one another will come more clearly as you continue to share with one another. The true purpose of this venture will become obvious and crystal clear. God is guiding you and God will continue to do so. Keep yourselves open and allow a clear channel between your soul and your mind so that the gems that lay within your soul, this deep wisdom, will unfold in all its goodness and proper timing and reflection of God's Will. May God bless you deeply. I am Matthew and I continue to be with you as do others in this great venture. God bless you. My love is with you.
