I am here Eileen. As I listen to your concerns a smile comes across my face, remembering my own concerns and wondering if I had the courage to proceed. Like you I prayed and my connection with God and the Presence and the Love gave me the courage to proceed. You have reached out to this world with Divine Love and the truth of it, wishing to embrace all cultures and creeds, crossing boundaries with love.

This too is what Findhorn wishes to do. To eliminate those things that separate us and embrace all. And yes, there are words that resonate and perhaps not everyone will understand but if you reach out to the longing in each soul for love, for community, for connection, you will touch deeply those who you wish to communicate with, who you wish to make your presentation to. You are well on your way. 

I told I would help you all you had to do was ask. And in answer to those questions you have, I hope I have addressed them. Embrace the many, touch the heart, awaken the soul and have the courage to walk into the light of Godâ€™s love. God bless you all. I am truly your friend and sister in the Celestial Heavens, I am Eileen. God bless you.
