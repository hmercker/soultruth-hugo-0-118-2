Beloved souls, I am Goldie. You have called me forth and so I come to spread the good and joyous news that you are all loved, and that in this Love you may feel deep and abiding joy. For what gives you joy, beloved souls, but a sense that you belong to God, that you are his beautiful children loved beyond measure, cared for in love, given the blessing of life, given all the wonderful gifts and touches of Light and Love that can be given to any mortal or spirit. Joy beloveds, is the expression of the soul in love with God. And in this joyful reunion between your soul and God’s Soul comes the wonderment of an awakened soul knowing the richness, the beauty, the complexity, all the wondrous elements of the universe open to you through the Gift of God's Love, bringing your soul alive, bringing to you the joyous dance of life.

May God bless you on that wondrous journey of awakening, my beautiful friends. If you ask for me, I will come and visit each one of you and bring some joy to your heart, for this is my gift; this is what I bring. For, I know God's Love to such a degree that I am the epitome of joy, as are all my beautiful brothers and sisters in the Celestial Heavens. Joy is the atmosphere of Heaven and in Heaven there is limitless joy. May you all find your way there, my beautiful friends, and I will come to give you a kiss and welcome you to this place of great Light and joy.

Seek God’s Love within your souls, my friends, and you will know all the joy that you could possibly know, and feel within your heart the expansive and wondrous sense of God's universe and Soul. God bless you my beloved friends, I am Goldie and I love you. I love you, I love you. Joy be with you, joy and Love and Light. God bless you.
