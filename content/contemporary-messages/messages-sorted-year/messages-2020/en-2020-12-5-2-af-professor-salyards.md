December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Lightbrighters, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

It is your Professor Salyards here. Our dear and beloved Matthew expresses profound truth and vital information for the continued progression of these efforts.

And you do indeed lay foundations and you do indeed struggle and make great effort to be uplifted in light, to awaken to truth, to put aside the distortions of your mind in favor of the clarity of your soul. These things continue to evolve as your souls continue to awaken, as God continues to touch your soul with His Love.

Yet you have come upon a threshold, a great opportunity which requires a great deal from each one of you and will require ever more as you progress upon this trajectory. So, I urge you to put your efforts forward with great dedication so that this venture may indeed flourish and come to its eventual realization and beautiful outcomes assisting God in the salvation of humanity. We in the world of spirit and the celestial spheres are indeed behind you in support and do whatever we can do to help assist you in your efforts. The higher you go within your own soul, the clearer you are as Matthew has invited you to be, so we may work more closely together, so there will be no missteps but progressive steps and a greater light and greater effectiveness in your efforts.

Yes, much is coming, there will be a great flurry of activity required from you in the coming months. And there will be great interest. Although, as with many ventures, the beginnings will be humble. But I tell you as you accumulate souls into your orbit and express yourselves in ever clearer and greater ways, higher in intention and love, so you will attract many and the many will attract many. So we urge you on my friends, we urge you forward and you will indeed see as you continue day by day in your contemplations, in your inspirations, in your efforts, what is required, what will facilitate and bring to fruition these objectives. Continue to see yourselves as instruments of God's Will and with this attitude you bring us closer, for are we not all instruments of God's Will and this unity of intention and desire to serve God and to bring light, greater light into the world. So all will unfold in harmony with God's Will and plan.

May God bless you on that journey my friends. It is such a stupendous opportunity to serve. If you could but see the direction that you are headed, you would be amazed at what is coming and what will come in accordance to your will, your desires and your efforts. God bless you, my friends. This your Professor Salyards and I too pray with you and for you and serve God together with you in these great efforts for the salvation of humanity.

God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you deeply with His Love. My love is with you.
