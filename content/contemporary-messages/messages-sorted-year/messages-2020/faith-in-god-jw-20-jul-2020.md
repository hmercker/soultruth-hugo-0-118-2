# Faith in God

July 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am Clare of Assisi, your sister and friend in Christ. I come to this gathering, this sacred blessing, this circle to join you in prayer for God’s Love. I wish to tell you that to connect to the Heavenly Father is a simple act, a simple intention of allowing the longing in your soul to ascend over your mind from the depths of your heart, to be at One with God in His Love. If you wish this to be your guidance simply remember this longing.

When I prayed on earth I would fold my hands and I would be on my knees, I would close my eyes but my gaze would be heavenward to match the longings in my heart. And this gaze to the heavens allowed me to see the angels and the light and even the presence and beauty of the master, as God blessed us all. We did not need much and we did not desire much knowing that God would provide for all of our needs. This faith we had became ever present as all things were provided by our Heavenly Father, enough that we could share with those who even had less than us. I tell you my sweet and beloved friends the real gift was God giving us His Love which we gave to each one in gratitude and thanks. May this be your guidance to carry this love to all.

Stay open to the Fathers Love and Light and you cannot go wrong. How we are loved, how we are loved. May God’s Love be with you. With all my love and blessings, I am your sister in Christ, I am Clare of Assisi. Go with God.
