# I Bless You as My Disciples

March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Soul Awakening Tour Eastern US, Monroeville, PA, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloveds, I am Jesus. I come because you begin to gather the souls, to help them upon their journey towards God. As such, I bless you as my disciples who bring this Truth more fully into the realisation and understanding of those you touch in these Circles of Light. I come because I love you, beloved souls. I come to uplift you and strengthen you in body, in mind, to help you to brighten your soul in prayer.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am with you. Know that I will be with you each day as you continue to gather in Light. I am with you. My love is with you. I shall come and speak to those who gather. God bless you. I love you. God bless you.
