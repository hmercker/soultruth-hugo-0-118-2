# Opening Channels for Healing Energies to Flow

Seretta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

Hello dear friends, I am Seretta Kem, and I come in response to your prayers with a message of love. I bring forward the gifts that I carry, a longing to bless you, to serve God, to bring healing and to help each one of you with the development of your own healing gift.

As you gather in this way through the wires, it is the lattice of light – soul to soul – that allows us to work in unison and bring forth the blending and mixing of chemicals each one of you carry unique to you helping your brothers and sisters. There is a blending and mixing of the chemicals just as if you were sitting in person, together in circle. We have this ability to utilize the lattice of light in this way.

There is much that happens in the development of all gifts, but in your healing gift in particular.  These healing energies need to be able to move through your physical body.  We work upon the physical clearing channels and meridians within your body, opening channels so the energy flow may move swiftly and readily. At times, in your sessions while sitting for the development of your gift the experience may be very physical. You may feel a loosening of tightness within your body, you may see enhanced colours and visions and you may feel heat, coolness and a great sense of calm. Allow the body to move in the way that it desires while you are in these healing sessions. It is only us assisting you and clearing the physical body of any stagnant energy that is within the physical body to allow the healing energies to move freely and swiftly.

We have been with you this week while you have been in your prayers and go about your day. It is lovely to see the dedication that you are exercising in your commitment to being a channel of healing energies for God. Continue placing your hands upon yourself as you have been.  Should a time offer itself where there is a friend in need, do not hesitate to offer the blessing of your hand upon another.  All you need to do is place your hand there and say a little prayer to God asking to be an open channel of healing energies to move through you and then allow God to bless the beautiful soul that is in need.  This does not require any formal training or setting. When you see another before you in need it is a soulful response to offer a blessing of healing.

Through this practise of engaging in your instrumentality and offering healing to others, you will become very familiar to the healing energies that can move through you. As these healing energies move through you, beloveds, they also bless you. You may feel that you are only being an instrument of healing for a friend or someone in need, but you too, are bringing the blessing of healing to yourself.  Do you see how love and the blessing of God take care of all?  When you open as a channel of healing for the Divine you are taken care of. That is a blessing and promise from God. We, your helpers, your celestial guides and teachers are there with you.

I thank you for honouring the call of your soul, for honouring God and for honouring your brothers and sisters for this is the nature of love and it is the nature of your soul, to love and be loved through all that you do.

I am Seretta Kem, and my love is with you as is the love of your healing angels that come to administer their gifts to you. God bless you.
