# God Sends His Angels to Assist You

March 8<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Soul Awakening Tour Eastern US, Monroeville, PA, USA

Andrew received by Al Fike

During your time together in prayer, you have established a deeper rapport with your angel friends. You will come to feel them more acutely in your prayers. Even during your day, you will feel that we are with you. We are surely with you, beloved souls, as you continue to yearn and long for the Fatherâ€™s Love and to be of service in the world. God sends His angels to assist you and to be in close rapport with you so that you may be in greater light and know a blessing of your brothers and sisters from spirit, walking with you, helping to protect, to uphold, to inspire, to guide.

Much we can do as you continue to open yourself to the possibilities of the Will of God and the Blessings of God. So you will find us close. You will know that you are never alone, but have your angel companions with you, assisting you upon your journeys, helping to bring you in greater alignment with God.

Your souls will know no fear, beloveds, and will know great love. You will be in harmony with all that is intended. You will know the great Love of God as a palpable force in your life, one that continues to change and bless you and bring greater Light, Truth, and a joy in your heart that will inform your thoughts and your deeds as you walk upon this Divine Path.

May God bless you, beloved souls, keep you close to the Source of All Love. God bless you. I am Andrew. My love is with you.
