Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your brother and friend Yogananda. All of you have received the great gift of God’s love and know the great truth of its availability. As each one of you grows on your journey to the Celestial Heavens, as each one of receives more and more of this great love, you truly become a channel for light and love in this world. So first and foremost remember as the Master said: “Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all else will be given to you” this is a great truth and it indicates what is most important on this journey for all else will be given. The path will be illuminated by the love you carry. And as you know this holy sacred glorious presence beyond the mind, beyond any words you say, is your gift to others.

As you grow and you bring this gift, this blessing, walking in Grace is truly all that is required of you. Because you have asked you have received. And as you touch other souls, and how well you know this, some will inquire as to what they are feeling around you and should you wish to do so, you can tell them what your spiritual practice is.

The love of God humbles us all and yet we are lifted up in its glory beyond any desire we may have had or still have for material things and for the satisfactions of this world. You know of course in spirit it is easier in some ways to let these things go because they no longer have any weight. And yet attachments linger on for many and they hover near the earth planes wishing to satisfy their desires. So for those who may be with us unseen we ask God to bless them with love. And those who are in the physical realm embrace them in God’s love. For they suffer from a certain blindness however temporary, and you who see and feel the light and love can shine on them, embrace them, lift them up as you have been lifted. This is the great gift of God’s love. As the changes are upon you in this time all we have asked is for you to pray. To stay in Grace beyond fear and to allow the light in your souls to guide you as to which path to take. This is still all that is required. Know you are protected and above all so very loved, as we all are by our Heavenly Father. Be not afraid, stay in this peace, in this love. We are with you. All my love and blessings my dear friends, I am your brother, Yogananda.
