I am here your sister in the love of God, I am Eileen. For those who do not know me I will introduce myself. I was the spiritual founder of the Findhorn Community in Northern Scotland. This community came from guidance I received from God as I prayed, and one period of my life came to an end. And the next period, which was guided daily, became a seed, became a flower, became a garden, became a community, as people shed their old lives and embraced the new. 

The value of community when it is centered on prayer, when there is trust and faith and guidance, is immeasurable. Although you do not all live in the same place, there is a Oneness in the love of God when you come together in communion, in community, opening your hearts, allowing God to touch your souls. 

The example of the metamorphosis of the caterpillar into the butterfly is often used to describe transformation. Consider the caterpillar who can only crawl and ingests leaves. Consider this as one on earth beginning to pray for and receive the substance of the Creator, which is love. And in the chrysalis, this caterpillar becomes a completely transformed creature with wings, a beautiful creature that can soar. One crawls, one flies. 

I tell you this to remind you that you can let go of crawling and allow the love God to change you, transform you, into the beautiful, angelic beings that you are destined to become. No one will demand this transformation of you. And I can tell you, it does not happen in a day. But the metamorphosis begins with the receiving of the Substance of the Creator, which is this divine love and as it grows in your soul, it completely changes you. Ask and you shall receive. 

This circle that is the result of the desires of each soul to feel love, to receive love, to share love, to be love. For love transforms the world; love heals. And love lights up the darkness. As you allow this change in your soul and you feel the light of love and the joy of being lifted above the material world and all its troubles in the company of angels, this magnetism will draw you in again and again. 

It is my privilege and honor to be with you in this circle of light on this journey you have undertaken from the earth plane to the Kingdom of God in the Celestial Heavens. May it be yours. God bless you with all my love, and the embrace of the Kingdom, I am Eileen Caddy.
