Jacob received by Helge Mercker

My daughter, we can begin to write. I am Jacob and I have introduced myself to you a day ago. I impressed upon you my appearance when I lived on Earth. You have received the impressions of the wide and arid open land and the big herds of sheep. We were a big family and loved our God. I am Jacob, a prophet who lived on Earth many, many years before our beloved Jesus came to Earth. You know of the times as our stories have been told in books. I am now an inhabitant of the Celestial Heavens, the Kingdom of God, living in the everlasting glory of His Love. My name is Jacob and I bring you a greeting of love as I heard your conversation about hearing the whispers of God. I heard God in my prayers and contemplations. I felt His guiding voice. I received visions and was guided in many stages of my long life on Earth. I was a man knowing the truth of the one God and my religion was simple. We lived in simplicity and little comfort, yet our yearnings of soul were directed to our God.

Much later in the spirit world, I heard of the Gift of God, that He gives It to anyone who seeks It, the Gift of His Love. Through the life of our Master much was revealed and we (in spirit) could see the presence of God making His Love available to each and every soul. Reaching to God in great sincerity I learned of the in-flowing of His Love. I am now a redeemed child of God and live in the astounding beauty this location brings.

I wish to share my journey as everyone has a journey to travel and it brings forth our deepest potentials and strengths. By living a faithful life, having faith in receiving the Father’s Love and the transformation it brings, and by having faith that this Love not only cleanses but transforms us, we are able to live in God’s Kingdom as a child redeemed by His Love. Oh, for the faithful the most beautiful residence awaits after a long journey on Earth. It requires faith.

To have faith in what God reveals to one, and to trust these words of wisdom and guidance, will bring His child closer to Him revealing the magnificence and beauty that was hidden for so long. And so, it requires great faith to live this Love in your world. We struggled too when on Earth, but it was our faith that gave us the strength. Have faith my daughter as God whispers in your soul, trust in His words and God will lead you in the most gentle and loving way. However, it requires one to seek the constant connection with God through prayers and communion. In the times of subtle connectedness, the strongest force, the strongest energy, God’s Divine Love, flows and brings with It the attributes of truth through the spirit of truth. Thus truth will lead you and the gained clarity is then based on truth as God reveals it through His Love.

This is a complex topic and I desire to write again and I wish for our rapport to strengthen as I have much to share. I will pray with you and all the dear souls seeking the Father’s Love. We come from far to be with you and we desire to bring our light and love as the world is in a process of great change. My love is with you dear daughter. Seek a close bond with God and come as an innocent child, for He longs for each child to receive His Love and so much more.

May God continue to bless you dear child and I will come to be with you. God bless you. Jacob, a prophet of old, loves you and brings his love and strength and light to help you find clarity in the many aspects of life in the Love of God. Goodnight and may our Heavenly Father bless you.
