Do you think you're trying a little too hard, my friends? To be that perfect idealized soul of God? Having all the answers now, having all the ways and means laid out in one beautiful document? My friends, I ask you to have mercy upon yourselves, to be joyful in your pursuits, to love every moment and realize that with every moment will come new insights, another step will be climbed closer to light and that God is blessing you upon this journey always. When there is joy, there will be enlightenment and truth and awakening of new and wondrous perceptions and ideals and guidance.

All is in God's Hands, beloved souls, allow yourselves to relax within this grasp of loving embrace of God's wondrous care for each of you, of God's beautiful and truthful guidance along the road towards the fulfillment of your great souls' purpose and loving ambitions to serve humanity. All is accomplished in love and all will unfold love and in love here is joy. May you know and feel the joy of God's loving embrace and your dear fellowship together, brothers and sisters seeking the truth, the way, and the light.

God bless you, I am Goldie and I am with you to help bring up the light, the conditions, the joy. God bless you. My love is with you, beloveds.
