Andrew received by Al Fike

God bless you dear souls, I am Andrew. How sweet it is for us to hear your prayers, your desires to be close to the Source of all Love and Light. How sweet it is to see you all, precious souls, gathering together from all corners of the world to seek for Truth, to seek for upliftment, to seek to be channels of Love and Truth in the world. It is our sincere hope, as I am sure it is God’s desire that many will come and gather towards the Light and seek to nourish the Light in the world. May they come to know that the greatest lens of Light flowing through them comes from the soul, that this manifestation of Light is truly a manifestation of the soul in relationship with the Creator, that this powerful connection between the soul, your soul and the Soul of God, is the way in which you may be instruments in the world for change, for blessings and healing, to bring the energies of Light and peace, Love and healing to the world.

It is the instrumentality of your souls beloveds, that need to be ignited and awakened. For, you can only do so much from your minds, from your intentions of thought. Though great they are, if one wishes to be in alignment with God, one must come to know their own soul and come to realize the potentials of this powerful relationship between the soul of the mortal and the Soul of God. God awaits each individual to come and partake of these rich and great blessings that God emanates and manifests into the universe. It is for each individual to understand the Laws and conditions by which these blessings may be absorbed, attuning oneself to this Source of all, doing so with humility, with a deep desire to know the secrets of God's universe. For, it is an eternal quest, this knowing of God, this knowing of your own self and the realization and opening of all the faculties of your soul awakened, enlivened, expressed in the Light of God's Love.

This Great Elixir, this Waters of Love, of Truth, of God Essence, are for all to drink, for all to know. It is not restricted to any one individual, nor is it restricted by belief or creed or culture. For, God loves every soul, every child upon this world and the world of spirit. God loves all and wishes for all to partake of the Living Waters. Drink deep, beloved souls, drink of this Essence of God. In this, the awakening of your soul will bring you to that place of great joy and knowing, of truly knowing your own the soul and truly cultivating a deep and profound relationship with God.

May you all find your way to this Great Source, this Great River of Love, for you were all destined to come into the Light. May you come into the Light of God's Love to find this Truth for yourself and clasp it close to your bosom. For, it is what your soul longs for, beloveds. It is what is meant for each one of you, to be in the Grace of God, to know the harmony that comes with this Grace, this Love, to know the wonderments that comes with the awakening of your soul, to know as you take each step in life that all is well and all is blessed.

You are all God’s children, and God’s deep Love for each one of you is so vast and great that you could not possibly comprehend its immensity, its power, its joy. The soul has such excitement, is thrilled by this potential of coming back to at-onement with God. Seek the desires of your souls, beloveds. Know that you are truly blessed in praying for this Gift of Love, that God hears your prayers and gifts you with this Truth and Blessing.

God bless you beloved souls, I am Andrew. My love is with you all, precious, precious souls, so needed in the world, so needed so that you may shine forth, be channels of Love and Truth. God bless you. God bless you all. Andrew loves you.
