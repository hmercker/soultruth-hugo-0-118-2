I am here John, a disciple of the master and one that comes in God’s love. This gift from the Heavenly Father that the master gave us the Truth of while he was on earth he continues to teach and bring in the heavens and on earth. This truth embraces all others, that God is love. These words made it into my gospel though it was interpolated, translated and re-translated many, many, times and that great truth stood, and still stands. This love of God, let it be your guide, let it flow in your lives.

May your words be filled with the essence and the glory of His love. You who wish to be transformed you know the way and we are with you and we are drawn to help you and guide you at your bidding and in answer to your prayers. May this love, this Divine distraction be yours. May God bless you and keep you in His grace every hour, every day, every night for all your days. You are loved. I am your brother in Christ. I am John.
