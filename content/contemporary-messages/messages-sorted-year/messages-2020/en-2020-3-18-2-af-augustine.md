# This Circle of Light Strengthens the Light Between You

March 18<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Pittsburgh Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine. I'm very happy to be within the Circle of Light that you have created, beloved souls. The harmony and unity that you foster together is important not only for your own well-being but for the well-being of your world as your world continues to become isolated and many are distancing in fear and in a desire to be safe. It is important that you come together in such an innovative way to be prayerful together, to unify your efforts, your prayers, your desires, sending them off to God, waiting for the response that God always brings to His children, souls so beautiful, souls that desire to be in the Grace of God.

Your efforts together bring light, beloved children. They bring comfort to one another but also comfort will spill forth to your families, to your loved ones, to the many who are connected to each one of you. Even those spirits that are with you will be comforted by this Light which you have sourced from God bringing the flow of His Light and Love into your midst, into the midst of this darkened world in which you live.

As you pray, seek the great Love of God, this Essence of God’s Soul that is required to awaken the soul. It is easily received in such a Circle as this as you continue to pray together. Each time you do so in this Circle of Light, so you strengthen the light amongst you. You bring God into your midst in a way and form that is almost palpable to you and as powerful in the ways that it blesses your souls.

The power of prayer, beloved souls, is far beyond the power of man to change the world. The power of prayer done with faith, with conviction, with sincerity, with wisdom can change the world. It can bring deep and great blessings to you and to all in your world provided the intention and focus and desire is great, that your faith is exercised, that you bring forth the Holy Spirit to bless your souls, that you open wide to God’s Embrace and feel this Embrace deep in your heart so that you may be uplifted, that you may be blessed deeply, that you may come to know God in a deeper way, in a powerful way that tells you that He is always there to uplift you and protect you and bring to you all good and worthy blessings of your soul.

We of the Celestial Kingdom, redeemed angels of God, will walk by your side and pray with you, whether you are together in the Circle of Light or alone, remember that you are never alone but we your guardian angels will be with you and will kneel in prayer. As you put forth your dedications and your love of God so we will walk by your side and seek to uphold you and inspire you to deeper and greater prayers to God. So you know this, beloved souls. As you walk together in this way forming this Circle of Light you recognize the power of prayer, the beauty of prayer, the wonderment of God’s Touch upon your soul.

Continue in your efforts and I shall be with you and many more. We will be with you. God's Hand will be upon you. Your souls will be opened and blessed with Love bringing the great transformation that you seek, the peace, the joy, the Truth and the wisdom that comes with the power of God’s Essence pouring into your soul.

God bless you beloved souls. I am Augustine and I am with you in your prayers. Many blessings, many blessings to you all. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
