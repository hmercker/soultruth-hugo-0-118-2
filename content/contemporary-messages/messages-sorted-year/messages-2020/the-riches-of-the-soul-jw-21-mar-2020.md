# The Riches of the Soul

March 21<sup>st</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



My dear children, I am Clare of Assisi. I was drawn to your circle, because of your discussion and because I felt the yearning of your souls and also, I had been watching over the sister who had been traveling in England and is now back in Canada.

I am the founder of the order of the Poor Clare's and though you may feel like little church mice, you are indeed on your way to become beautiful angels of Light, for you know what is of value, what is the riches of the soul, in the mist of the material world.  Your journeys have brought you to this place together, your souls wishing to be in harmony, to understand and to progress in the Glory of God’s Love.  We support this in every way and we are here.

Yes the universe is vast and the Kingdom is beyond human imagining, but you have made a connection in Light and in Love. That cannot be broken. This is the bridge between heaven and earth and you are on it.

I shall come again and guide you and be your sister on this journey toward the Fountainhead of God’s Love. God bless you. I am your sister in the Celestial realms, Clare.
