# You Will Learn to be Awake Within Your Souls

April 11<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Mediumship Workshops, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Joseph received by Al Fike

This is Joseph. You will learn to be awake within your souls. You must have patience with yourselves. You must have trust in God’s ministrations and guidance for you, beloved souls. Having faith in the journey that God has set you upon will put aside your worries and cares and will bring to you a great enthusiasm and desire for more of God’s blessings, for is this not a wondrous journey, a journey that has its challenges and difficulties, but primarily it is a journey that brings joy and truth, awakens all of you and aligns all of you with God? You will find your way, beloved souls. You will find your way. I promise you. You will find you way.

I am Joseph and I have been observing your conversations and your interactions and your journey as you have committed yourself to this course of action. Know that I will come to assist you. I will come to help give you strength and to inspire you. I am not the only one, beloved brothers and sisters. There are many more who eagerly desire to assist you, to be with you. So, God and His great Love for us all brings us together in harmony, brings us together as you seek to know the Truth. So, these gifts from God will open the doorways to Truth, will open doorways to your gifts, open doorways to serving humanity with humility and love.

May God bless you on that journey, beloved souls. I am Joseph and I pray and walk with you as your friend upon the path. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
