I am Keea-atta Kem. I am the one who oversees all of your beautiful prayer circles that are being ignited by your prayers and your efforts together in Circles of Light. I see that in the future there will be many circles such as these in the world. As you come together, you are setting a sort of standard practice that will be repeated by many. This will proliferate in many different places around the world, in many different countries. 

Those souls who are eager for light, who are eager for truth, who desire the blessing of God's Love will come together as you come together and will help to build and maintain Portals of Light and sustain the networks of light around the world. What you do here is just the beginning of great things, things that will be powerful and will influence the condition of your world as you continue to speak of this Truth and be an example of this Truth together. 

As you pray together and singly, know that an angel is with you and that you are a part of something far greater than the experience you may have together today, that there is a plan afoot. You are a part of this plan. You will continue to help others gather together, souls of like mind and soul, in these sorts of prayers beseeching God for His blessing of Love. In times to come these prayers and circles will be a Godsend to many and will bring peace and comfort to many, and will open the hearts and souls of many.

Know that you continue to strive forward and be a part of this great plan for the salvation of humanity. This plan is not necessarily of your doing but is in response to your commitment to follow God's Will and be a part of His plan. As you continue to grow in His Love and listen with the heartbeat of your soul, so you will come to know God's Will and be steadfast in the unfolding of His Will in the world. You will be able to reach many souls, beloved, many souls indeed. This is how this light will spread, how others will feel the longing within their soul to be a part of such a family of light and will be guided because they have prayed and sought to be a part of these networks and Circles of Light around the world.

Continue to pray for your efforts to be a part of these powerful circles. Whether it be just a few of you or many in this circle, you will send out the invitation by your prayers and the light that you gather together within, God's blessings pouring through these portals out into the world. It will touch many. At this moment, this light is pouring to many thousands of souls. You could not count nor recognise these beloved souls but indeed your efforts are far-reaching. 

You will find that many who have been touched in this way will make efforts to be a part of your work. This plan continues to unfold in the world as others feel the change that is here already and the change that is coming. So within them, deep within them, the signal, the bell toll will chime within their minds and cause them to act accordingly, seeking out their brethren, seeking out light, seeking out love and peace and healing for them, their souls and their loved ones. Can you see how touching one may touch many who touch many more? This is how God's plan will unfold. One light lighting many lights lighting many lights. It is God's plan and Will that this will be.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea-atta Kem. My love is with you. Yes we continue to work to bring the Light of God's Love into your world. How wondrous it is? How beautiful are your souls. How wondrous is the work, the plan, the unfolding of Godâ€™s Will in your world. May God bless each one of you with insight and understanding and recognition of that which I speak of today. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with you. My love is with you. God bless you. God bless you.
