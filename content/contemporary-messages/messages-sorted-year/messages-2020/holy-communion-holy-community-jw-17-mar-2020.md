I am here your brother Francis. The words holy communion means to be in communion with God. In these beautiful circles that you have, each one is in communion, each one to the extent of their longings and abilities to be open. I say to you all, these longings are everything. They transcend any words you might have and they bring you into this glorious communion. 

The world at the moment may not be discovering the great gift of Divine Love but certainly many are in prayer. And you can see neighbors recognizing their neighbors, some for the first time, and people singing out, reaching out, even though they may not physically touch as we cannot physically touch you, yet we reach out in spirit. So many around the world are reaching out in the spirit of love, in community. Your community reaches out in prayer and it becomes communion, sacred communion.

Many may come to you recognizing that you have a connection beyond this world; a loving connection that they may feel. To those who reach out let your heart open do not deny them, love each one, and offer a prayer if you are moved to do so. A prayer asking God for love, for healing. This will offend no one and will bless many so that all may grow in the garden in of Godâ€™s love and blossom as you are blossoming my beautiful friends. It is a wonder to see the light that connects us and the love that we share in God. Keep this communion allow this community to flourish. Even when you cannot touch you can reach out. And so you are, and so it is. May it continue to be.

God bless you. I am truly your brother and friend, I am Francis.
