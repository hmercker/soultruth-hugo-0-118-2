# Trust and Change

July 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Gibsons Circle of Light, Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Mahatma Gandhi received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you, dear friends. I join you in your Circle of Light longing for the great blessing of God's Love. It is inflowing into your souls, washing, cleansing, healing, and awakening all the glory, the glory of who you are, the blessing of who you are. I am Gandhi. May I speak to you about trust and about change? For in Godâ€™s Universe, change is an element, is a flow that is constant for nothing stays the same.

You are all well aware it is quite a human thing to want things to last and change to somehow not happen in those things that you experience in your life, feel like great blessings. Then there comes a flow of change upon this aspect of your life. It can be difficult for you to except and allow the rhythm and the flow and the experience of change into your life.

This is where the understanding and the embracing of trust comes in, for trust is connected to faith is connected to love is connected to God is connected to your soul. When you can come to a place of deep trust and that which is unfolding in your life, those changes that are occurring, and you accept and you allow this flow to happen and occur, the rhythm of the change has a flow that is harmonious and a flow that brings greater alignment, for you do not know what God gift God has for you on the other side of this change and where this newness comes into your experience of your living.

Each of you experience change in a very deep and real way for you pray for Divine Love. It is with the blessing of Divine Love that you will be changed, deeply, profoundly, in ways that are unknown and unimaginable to you where you cannot know and understand at this point in time the great plan that God has for each and every one of you through the awakening of your souls and through your individual instrumentality.

So when you are in the midst of change, you may be feeling anxious or resistant or trying to figure things out through the material mind, I ask you and suggest to you that you exercise trust and you exercise acceptance and allowing that which you are experiencing to flow through you.

Any conditions that are darkening your soul, the light of your soul, from shining forth, they shall be lifted. You will be changed in a great and real profound way. So change is a blessing, dear friends. Perhaps look at change as something you may receive due to your prayerful life, your soulful prayers, your longing and reaching to God to comfort and bestow upon you His Love.

Receive the change that you were moving through and allow the experience of your life to continue to blossom into a full and rich awakening. There is great Love all around you. God's Love, as you well know, is only but a breath away. All you have to do is feel within your soul a longing. Reach to God in a heartfelt, deep way through every breath to receive His great blessing and comfort and Love.

This, dear friends, will carry you upon the wings of change. Allow yourselves to trust in God, to trust in your destiny, and to trust in your awakening. Always remember, your beautiful angel friends are walking with you, assisting, and guiding. I thank you for hearing these words and taking to heart this idea of change and trust and receiving its blessings. My name is Gandhi. My love is with. God bless you.
