Andrew received by Al Fike

The Breath of God is upon you, beloved souls, I am Andrew. He envelopes you in His Peace, the peace that passes all understanding, the Light that is the Light of His Great Soul shining down upon each one of you, the gentle resting of His Hand upon you, lovingly guiding you, beloved souls, bringing you into the clear light of understanding and knowledge. And with the instrumentality of His Holy Spirit, He brings His Greatest Gift into your souls as you yearn and seek to be blessed in this way.
 
Beloved souls, brothers and sisters, seek to be in the Light of God's Presence, to know the peace, to know the joy, to know the Love, and you will find that all your worries and cares will blow away with the wind and not be so great, not be so burdensome, so that you may feel this upliftment and joy that comes in prayer. You are God’s children and God gathers you around Him. God seeks to uphold you. God wants you to know His Love. God wants you to hear His whispers and guidance for your soul. And in this your souls rejoice. You come to know these Truths as a clear and powerful beacon of Light for your life.

So you will join us in the Celestial Heavens one day, making your way through all the challenges, the tests, the blessings and the revelations, all that is given to assist you upon this journey and bring to you a true awakening of the transformation of your soul in Love. So God gives you much, beloved souls. God seeks for all that is of good and light, of joy and love, of truth and strength and clarity to be yours. And all will be yours as you continue on this journey. All is given in the timing, the rhythm of your soul’s journey towards at-onement with God.

God bless you beloved souls. God bless you and keep you in His Light. I am Andrew and I am happy to be with you today in your prayers. In your prayers we will come to see the Truth, the Way and the Light. God bless you.
