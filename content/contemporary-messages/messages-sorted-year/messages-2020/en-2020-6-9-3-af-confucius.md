Confucius received by Al Fike

God bless you beloved souls, I am Confucius. I am happy that my brother does not resist my influence, for I started from a very different place than your Christian upbringing and ideas, and yet here we are together, brothers all upon a path that brings Truth, that brings us all together in harmony, that brings the soul awakened with the Great Gift of God's Love. And yes, we all look to our beloved and beautiful Master Jesus, who has shown us all the way to this Great Love, and will continue to follow his footsteps. Yes, we are all brothers and sisters upon this path. No matter where we begin, we shall be in at-onement with God at some time in eternity.

Have compassion, acceptance, love for your brothers and sisters, no matter their beliefs and ideas, continue to reach out in love, to acknowledge that every soul has its path to God, and every soul is beautiful and is endowed with many potentials and gifts that shall be realized. Whether they walk upon the path that is of the natural love or that which is of the Divine, they will find an awakening of sorts, an awakening and purification of their beings. Yet, upon the path that we all follow together, there is the acknowledgment that the awakening shall never cease but continue to unfold for all eternity. How blessed we are with this Gift that God has given us, the jewel of our souls awakened in Love, the Essence of God’s Love.

So we gather together, brothers and sisters all, upon the magnificent journey, coming to know ourselves, coming to heal ourselves, coming to acknowledge the great beauty that is ourselves. So our love reaches forth for God, for one another, for the universe and all of God’s Creation. We see with the eyes of our souls, the magnificence of God. May we share this great Truth, this deep knowing of our souls with all.

Beloved and beautiful souls of God, may we be always in His Embrace, knowing that we are His children, knowing the beauty, the wonderment, the Love and the joy that is a soul redeemed by God. May you be enveloped with deep peace, abiding Love uplifting you always in the Light of God. Be a light in the world, beloved souls, be a light in the world.

God bless you. I am Confucius and I love you dearly. I am with you often. You are never alone, for angels with you always. God bless you, precious, precious souls, precious souls. God bless you.
