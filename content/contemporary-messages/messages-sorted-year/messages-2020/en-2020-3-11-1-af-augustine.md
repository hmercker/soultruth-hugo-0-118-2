March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Soul Awakening Tour Eastern US, Monroeville, PA, USA

Augustine received by Al Fike

I wish to acknowledge this instrument and the efforts that he has made to be a channel for we in spirit, to be a channel for God's Love through him, to uphold standards of Truth and love to the highest measure. He will continue to do so upon these journeys that he and his dear mate are embarked upon at this time. There will be no obstructions so that these times of service will be effective and draw in the souls that are in need of the guidance and reassurance. There is nothing to fear, beloved souls. Though some do fear, they are assuaged by the influence of the angels so that this fear does not overtake them.

The power of love, the power of each of you here to enact of the Will of God is greater than any other force in your world. You must rely upon this power, this protective flow of Love that will inform your lives. It is important that you acknowledge this, that you do not entertain thoughts of fear and reticence, but follow your guidance. For when you are committed to the Will of God, then all other forces are subordinate. Whatever conditions or situations may be of a threatening nature are in play, you will be protected, beloved souls, realise this. Even in situations of physical harm, you are protected.

As you enact the Will of God, so there is the remedies for all things that are not in harmony with God. The power of love is greater than all else. It is the highest blessing, the most powerful touch and influence. As you travel and journey and meet others, know this is. It is the power of love that will inform your efforts and inspire you forward. There is nothing to fear and a great deal that may be given for the benefit of your brothers and sisters. Have faith in this. Be strong in your faith. Be confident in the Touch of God, the Will of God in your life.

Trust that all is well, for truly it is and will be. God bless you, my friends. God bless you and keep you in His Love. I am with you, your teacher and friend, I am with you. Augustine loves you.
