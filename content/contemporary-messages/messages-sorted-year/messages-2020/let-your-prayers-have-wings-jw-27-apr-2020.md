# Let Your Prayers Have Wings

April 27<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Khalil Gibran. Yes it is me. This one has been in rapport with me on this day.

The heart, the physical heart, receives oxygen from the lungs in the blood and the spiritual heart receives its life on the wings of prayer. For prayer gives wings to each soul allowing it to rise above the physical world to the ether of spirit and onward to the Celestial realm. So, let your prayers raise you up that your soul may touch on heavensâ€™ door and the love of God, Who hears your heart before you utter even a word. 

I shall come again and it is my honor to be in this prayer with you. I am your brother in the love of God, I am Khalil Gibran. May God bless you.
