Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Jesus. You are gifted with peace. You are gifted with an opportunity in your daily lives to be in communion with God, to have time in prayer unencumbered by your obligations. I come to tell you that God hears all of your prayers, that God knows each of you intimately, that God knows your needs, your desires, your thoughts, and your actions. God is aware of each of His children upon this Earth and all who are in spirit. God knows you and His intention is to carry you into Light. Allow God to uplift you, beloved souls. Allow God to wipe away your anxieties and your fears, your speculations and your trepidations. Be at peace and know that despite all the conditions of your world, those things that are unpredictable and difficult, God is with you and shall lift you up beyond the conditions of which I speak and bring you into Light.

For you are blessed by God, my beloved brothers and sisters. You are blessed. You shall carry the light of this blessing into your daily life and walk in the world as a light so that God may use you as His instruments to bring greater light to your brothers and sisters, to bring the blessing of love, the blessing of healing and peace. All things of God may flow through you, beloved souls, to your brothers and sisters.

All things of God are flowing towards you at this moment. Open yourselves to these blessings. Awaken yourselves to all that is of God, that your souls may indeed see and know, feel and sense, understand and perceive all things of God. With this gift of His Love, so these things are made possible, and you may walk upon this Path Divine for all eternity. May God claim you and set you upon this path, awaken you and bring you into glorious at-onement, where Love brings unlimited joy and Light, Truth and all that is in the flow of His Will.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am with you. Know that I am with you. I am with many in your world at this time of great difficulty. The angels of God are working ceaselessly to uplift humanity, to help each soul come into the Light, the Light of God. Blessed are you, beloved souls, who walk in this Light, who yearn for this Light, who gather together to bring Light to the world and to your own souls. You are blessed. Peace be upon you, my brothers, my sisters, peace be upon you. May His Love find a great inflowing into your souls, awakening, healing, and bringing great peace.

God bless you. I am your brother and friend, Master of the Celestial Heavens. I am Jesus. God bless you. God bless you, beloved ones. My love is with you. I shall never leave you. God bless you.
