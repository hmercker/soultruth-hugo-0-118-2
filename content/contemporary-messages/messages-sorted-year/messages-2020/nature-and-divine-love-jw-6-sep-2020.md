I am here your brother and friend in the Love of God, Yogananda. My dear ones, as the waves wash upon the shore, as the sun rises and sets, as the moon lights up the night, allow yourselves to be in harmony with nature. Allow your souls to be in the flow of the Love of God, without attachment, but in harmony with the natural world and in the flow of God’s timing. When one goes within and senses the oneness of all things, it is a beautiful realization. And as I have said before, when one connects with the Creator, the source of all things, there is unspeakable bliss, joy and happiness. The flow of God’s Love and harmony with nature go hand in hand.

Although the Love of God transcends the world, it is never at odds with it. This is why those who speak out for social justice, against tyranny and violence, only need to be in harmony with the natural love. That love gives one insight into how the world can be in harmony in all ways, in brotherly and sisterly love, in a sustainable environment, in peace and nonviolence, in good health, and all these things of the earth that God wishes for His children to be in harmony with.

For you who choose the path of Diving Love, you can see the beauty of the natural and harmony on earth. You also bring a light that is more powerful than human insight, and that is the perceptions of your soul that allow the Grace of God and the great message of His Love to touch all who wish to be at one with their Creator.

May God bless you and carry you in this great endeavor to bring the message of Divine Truth to the world. May I say: *“We have your backs, and you have our love and our hearts.”* Whatever you need, call on us, God will provide and we shall do his bidding. With all my love and blessings, I am your eternal friend in the Love of God, Yogananda.
