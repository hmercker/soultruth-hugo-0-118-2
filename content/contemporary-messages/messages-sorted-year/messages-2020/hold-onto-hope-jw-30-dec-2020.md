Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am happy to be with my kind mice. As we approach a new dawn and yet you can feel as if on a precipice with a view of a new world and yet the dangers of falling, and what is required of the world to change. If you can hold this vision and feel the love, the love of God and the goodness of change, you can drop your fears, your concerns, your trepidations. That fill the world with thought and the emotions of humankind at present. So many fearful, and yet there is so much hope. I would ask each one of you to hold that hope in your hearts and bring it to others. The world needs to be lifted- up during this time of transition and great change. To not lose hope, to not lose sight of the beautiful valley below from the mountaintop of divine love that you hold in your soul, to envision, as it is your wish for the world to be changed in love and in peace; a new world of equality, sustainability. 
 There is the song ‘Imagine’ that I am aware of which has many wonderful thoughts in it. It goes beyond religious belief into the brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind. Imagine all the people living as one. My dear mice you can envision this and imagine this in the love of God, embracing all. This love that we bring to you. This love that you open to receive. It is not complex. In fact, I would say to you that when you can cast aside all the complexities, all of the struggles, all of the mindful attempts to comprehend and understand, you will simply rest in the love of God. 

The irony is that all those things you wish to understand are revealed in the magnificence of the Creators love. Let it be yours. Rest in this truth, in this beautiful gift you have been given. Bring this love, bring this desire, not only to the world but to this circle, for many come that you cannot see, wishing a blessing and are drawn to the light and are curious as to what will be said, what you will read, even perhaps for a song. If you can keep your heart focused on the simplicity of God’s love, we will protect you and all join in with you to celebrate a new life along with a new year on earth in the love of the Creator. I love you and I am your sister in Christ my dear friends. God bless you . I am Clare.
