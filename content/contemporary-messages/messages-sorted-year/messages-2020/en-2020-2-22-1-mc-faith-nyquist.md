# You Are At-One with the Creator to the Degree of Divine Love in Your Soul

February 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2020

Mediumship Workshops, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Faith Nyquist received by Maureen Cardoso

May Godâ€™s Divine Love touch your souls and may the Essence of the Creator wash clean those conditions of your soul that inhibit your beautiful light from shining. God bless you, dear friends. My name is Faith. I join you to share words of encouragement as you gather in such a way, all desiring to be of service in the highest way to the beloved Creator. Each of you long to know who you are and who God is.

It is through the great blessing of this Love flowing into your souls that you will come to know who you are in a very deep and true way and who your Creator is. For, it is a soul to soul communion that is established and innate within each one of you. The blessing of receiving the Divine Love strengthens that communion. It will awaken your soul, the true beauty of who you are. Each of you has just a glimmer of who you are in truth and each of you so graciously walking your path desire to know more. It is one thing to desire to know more from the perspective of the mind and it is another to know more from the perspective of the soul.

It is the Divine Love which awakens the perspective of the soul and consciously brings forth truth, wisdom and knowledge into your mind. For, it is by the Grace of Divine Love that your wisdom, your knowledge, and your truth will be attained within your soul. In your life you will walk deeply connected to your Creator serving in the light with strength and confidence. This is an incremental growth within each one of you and it is an eternal journey. The Divine Love will awaken you.

In some teachings, it is taught that you are already at one with the Creator. But, I say to you in truth to the degree of the Divine Love that you have in your soul you are at one with the Creator. Bless yourselves daily by sitting such as you are and open yourselves. Open and yearn and long from your soul to receive this great blessing. Your gift of mediumship will flourish and all your gifts will flourish. Knowings will come and understandings of whom you are in truth and in Love.

God bless you, dear ones. It is a pleasure to be with you and travel on the path of awakening, helping to assist you, to uplift you, to be with you, to bring our light and gifts to serve the beautiful children of Earth. I am Faith. I reside in the Celestial Heavens and I am a Divine Angel by the Grace of receiving the Divine Love. God bless you.
