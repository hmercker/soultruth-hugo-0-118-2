# All the Universe is Governed by Love

February 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Received by Al Fike



The Essence of God is Love. All the Universe is governed by Love. Sadly it is humanity that does not realise this and does not see the power of love as it is, its beautiful workings and influences in the world. So we urge you to continue to open your soul to this great gift of Love, this abundance that God has to give. For God loves you all with such depth and breadth that you could not comprehend the power and glory of Godâ€™s Love for each one of you. No matter your station in life, what you have done with your life, how difficult or how easy your life has been, you are loved by God equally. 

For humanity to continue to move beyond the dark conditions of this world that it has created, there needs to be a recognition, an understanding of the power of love. It is not an intellectual concept. It is a feeling and a knowing, something deep in your heart, beloved souls, deep in your hearts lies this desire to connect with the Creator and to know the Love of the Creator. It is in the asking, the prayer, the longing and the desire of the soul that this Great Gift is realised and recognised. There is nothing deeper, higher, or more profound than this Gift. It opens the door to many, many things, deeper understandings of Truth, great waves of joy, releasing all those things within you that weigh you down and that are not of love. So much can be given with a simple prayer, a longing of the heart, a desire to go beyond the limited perceptions of the mind to that place of soul that may be awakened with this Gift. 

You all sense yourselves being on the edge of the threshold of new awareness and new understanding of transformative Love that is available to you. Follow your hearts. Follow that deep desire to know God, to know your own dear souls, which have much to offer you and to share with you from different eyes, from a place beyond the mind that is deeply intuitive and that knows much that the mind cannot know. 

Your soul awaits your acknowledgement, beloveds. Your soul seeks to awaken, to truly know itself and be expressed in all aspects of your life. For too many on this Earth the mind dominates and does not recognise the deeper aspects of each soul. Here, when you come to pray in these Circles of Light, you are offering yourselves a great opportunity of venturing into realms that for many are unfamiliar, yet they feel as if you have come home. This is the place to discover and know your true selves in prayer and longing, in receiving and giving, in humility and grace. The Love of God will fill you up and bring you great joy. 

May God bless you on that journey, my beloved friends. Know that the angels are with you. They surround you at this moment. All help is given, all assistance to rise up above the conditions of your world to a place that is filled with joy and Truth and Love. It is available to each one of you. It is given freely. It is a Gift from God. May God bless you. I am Andrew. My love is with you. God bless you.
