# Honoring the book “For the Love of His Creation”

August 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Kahlil Gibran. I come in the love of God and I wish to honor this dear soul who was given such a beautiful story<sup>1</sup> and received it so well. And I speak from experience for although I was a worldly man, yet when I opened up to the angels they wrote through me often beyond my own comprehension. Yet what I received has ended up touching millions. 

This lovely soul, humble and desiring to serve opened up and in the midst of the world around her that was extremely busy, sometimes chaotic. She allowed her gifts to blossom into a book , into a story that will touch many. One can read it as a romance novel as I too had this inclination in my writings because the human love is something that we all feel and understand. Any yet the longings of the soul in times of crisis calls out to God for guidance, and when you ask you do receive. This is the true story, the true admonition of this book. To pray, to go to God, to seek guidance especially in these times. This will carry you, protect you and shine a light upon your path.

May all who read this beautiful book not only digest it with their minds but hold the message in their hearts and allow their souls to receive the gift that is intended; God’s love and guidance and healing. With all my love and blessings and my gratitude I am your brother and friend in the love of God.

I am Kahlil Gibran. May God bless you.
