Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

And I will only add a few more words, I am Professor Salyards. My commitment to you is that I will assist each and every one of you upon this great effort and journey of discovering the ways and means of serving humanity through the gifts of your soul. I and many more from the Celestial kingdom are with you on that journey. We will be by your side at all times and at your beck and call. Remember this when you think of these opportunities and this conversation and you have questions or you are doubting or you feel resistant, ask us to assist you, to guide you, to inform you so that you may have these questions answered, so that you may see beyond the limitations of your thinking to the truth within your soul.

Much will come to each one of you, my friends. I say to you, you are deeply blessed and you have before you a great opportunity. May you come together in harmony, may you come to acknowledge and respect each individual in this great circle of light and see that each has a role to play, something to contribute and is gifted and those gifts will shine forth in the crucible that you are creating together helping to forge the great expressions of God's beloved children in the world.

I am with you. I am with you often. It gives my soul great joy to serve, it gives my soul a great joy that you, each of you, wish to contribute to the education of humanity that they may come to understand the potentials of their own soul and in so understanding they choose to follow the route of at-onement with God through His Love.

May God bless you as you continue to make these efforts. Many are with you. And so we will continue in this great quest to fulfill God's plan for the salvation of humanity. God bless you, beloved souls, I am Professor Salyards. I am with you in this great effort. God bless you.
