# You Open the Door of Your Soul When You Pray

I am here, Matthew. Each time you pray, you come to the door of your soul. It is the intensity of your prayers that opens the door and allows you to enter therein with God, in communion with His Great Touch of Love and Presence. So, it is for you to travel that road between the mind that is engaged in everyday concerns and thoughts, putting this aside and travelling deeper into yourselves, your true selves, your soul. Each day that you do this with earnestness, in prayer and longing to God, so you wear the path more fully and reach your goal more easily. 

It is important that you exercise your faith and desire and mind in the direction of the soul, so that you may come to truly understand that place. That you may come to recognise the door that is somewhat ajar but needs to be opened fully, welcoming yourself within, recognising God’s joy in coming together in this place that He has provided for each soul to be able to commune with Him and to receive His gift of Love. 

For the beginner it is hard. It is a hard journey, one that is often misplaced and misguided. Though many feel the need and desire to be with God, they do not know the path that needs to be followed that leads to the soul. But when you have found your way, when you have truly understood and stood before this door, recognising within the truth of the matter that you are truly God’s children, that God has given you the opportunity to be in close communion and someday to be at-one with your Creator. 

Continue to pray for help and guidance to lead you upon that path, to clarify your journey, to help you to understand truly your soul, so that you will come to God in joyful abandon, in wondrous awakening, in true communion. For this door does not block the way but indicates the way to your soul and will always be open to you. 

It is your will that opens this door and it is your will that shuts this door. So it is for you to exercise your desire to come to that holy place that is within you. Where all will be awakened and shown clearly. Where the soul, in joyful recognition, acknowledges your very being and yearns to merge all that you are into soulful awareness and Truth. This is your goal, and this is what you yearn for. This is why you are praying and making these efforts together so to find your way to your soul, to know your soul in all its wonderment and facets and glorious self. In this, you open a Portal of Light that God may use you as His channels of Love, that God may awaken all that is within you, all that He wishes for you to be. He has implanted within you such great potentials, such wondrous seeds of gifts waiting to emerge in that glorious garden that is your soul.

May you continue to pray and yearn and recognise your footsteps upon this path as you journey from your mind to your soul and back again. As you do so, that path will become less strenuous. It will be a short distance, ever shorter. In time, no distance at all but a merging together into a glorious awakening and beautiful expression in the oneness of your being, the beauty of who you are and what God created you to be.

May God bless you upon that journey, beloved souls, and remember that we are with you. The angels of heaven walk with you upon that journey and continue to uplift and uphold you as you make your footfalls upon the path of awakening, the path to soul, the path of the soul to God. 

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Matthew and I am with you often. All of you, beloveds, all of you have been visited by an angel. Some of you are never without an angel and depending upon your desires and your prayers, this will be so. For, each of you who truly longs to be upon the Divine Path and expresses your soul to God in humility and grace, beauty and peace may God bless you. I am Matthew and I am with you. God bless you.
