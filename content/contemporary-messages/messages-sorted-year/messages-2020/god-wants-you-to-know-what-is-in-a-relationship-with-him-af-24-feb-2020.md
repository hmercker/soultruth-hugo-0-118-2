Received by Al Fike



Beloved souls, I am Andrew. With the clear yearning of the soul directed to God to receive the Essence of His Soul within your soul, this is when the Gift is given. This is how the Gift is received. A longing, a desire, a prayer, opening to God with all humility and innocence, seeking to know and be with your Creator. When you are together in this way in prayer and all are in unity in this desire, then the great blessing of God's Love pours upon you that you may drink your fill, beloved souls. Thus you may receive all that you are capable of receiving, that you have come to the fountainhead of all love to receive, to acknowledge, to feel and know the great peace that passes all understanding. A Touch of God upon you, a touch of peace surrounding you, awakening to all that is of Light, all that is of the highest realms, coming to this Earth, touching you all. You are blessed, beloved souls, you are blessed. For God desires for you all to truly know, to understand who He is and what is in this relationship between yourselves and the Creator.

So much, so much is still unknown. For all of you are barely beginning your journey to at-onement with God. So you may share this experience together. You may come to know this Love, peace and joy permeating all of you in this great blessing that God has for each one. Feel the power of this Love and draw it to you. Draw it with your yearning, your desire, your need, that deep need within you that says: *“I want to be close. I want to be with You. I want to be in Your Grace. I want to know Your Presence, the Touch of Your Love, the awakening that comes with this beautiful Gift.”* 

All is given and nothing is held back.  God gives in great abundance, giving as much as you can receive with the intention that more is coming, always. Doors will open. Your souls will open to the great flood of Love that is intended for you. With this the true self that is your soul will come to be a conscious realisation, will come and reveal itself to your conscious self, until some day in the future, both your conscious mind and the consciousness of soul will meld together, blending together in harmony and joy. 

This is the power of God's Love for each one of you. To bring this oneness, this unity within you so that you may see more clearly all that God has created, all that is intended to be in your lives, in your experience of life, the power of Love guiding you forward, the wonderment of Love Divine opening up all that is within you that is yearning to be awakened and expressed.

So much awaits you, so much that often you receive but a glimpse of what is truly within. As you continue this sojourn between your mind and your soul and your soul and God, more awakens, your eyes open wide and clear, receptive to all that is to be given. You will know God with such clarity and depth, such joy and love that all that you see in your life, all that you have experienced and all that is possible will merge into clear and wondrous perceptions, linking the faculties of the soul with the faculties of the mind into one great and wondrous capacity to know Truth and to all know that it is within God's Universe. 

Dear beloved souls, drink deep the blessings of God. At this moment His Living Waters pour upon you. Drink deep and know that you are continuing to rise up in Light and awaken from those deep places of the soul. May God bless you upon this journey. May God continue to bless you deeply, awaken you fully, bring to you all that is meant to be given and blessed and infused into your soul. 

God bless you. I am Andrew. My love is with you. God bless you.
