# Your Mind Can Create a Barrier between You and God

Beloved friends, may God's great Light and Love be your gift to your soul. I am Joseph and I come to pray with you, my friends. I come to be in this Circle of Light which you have created with your prayers. Even though you may be in far off places, you have created together something of unity and power and beauty that reflects the light within your souls. 

This Truth of God's Love is for everyone and it precludes religion, my friends. It is a pursuit of the soul and a soul knows no religion. Religion is of the mind. Many of you started your journey as Christians and yet, the one who taught the Truth of the Soul was a Jew, my own dear son. In those days the beliefs and religion of the Jews was quite different from what it is today. So it is in the world. The religious orders of the world continue to evolve and change, being creations of men and creations of the mind. 

But a true spiritual journey starts with the soul and the yearnings of the soul. Those demarcations of language and ideas regarding this experience with God come from the mind. The mind really is not the ideal instrument for understanding God. The mind merely speculates or observes the experience of the soul and it is within your soul that Truth is born. It is within your soul that true understanding is experienced and absorbed. 

So you must put aside all your preconceived ideas of this relationship between yourself and God, for as a child you come innocently to God. As a child, you are open and receptive to whatever God has to give to you. A child's mind is a simple mind, where all of you who are mature and have experienced a great deal in life, have minds filled with such detail and thoughts and facts, which in many cases create a barrier between you and God. 

This is not an insurmountable barrier, my friends, but it is a barrier nonetheless, something that you must reconcile and step beyond, to that innocent place of the soul which yearns to know God. May you come to that place of true knowing, of true understanding. For it is wordless yet profound, deep with great feeling and love, vast with a sense of God’s great Universe, awesome in the perceptions and realisations of the Presence of God. 

These mere words do not describe adequately the wonderment of this relationship that can be had with your Creator, your Creator who loves you beyond all imagining, greater than oceans, vast and always present. It is for you to be in God's Presence, beloved souls. Your prayers put your feet through the door, putting aside all conditions of your world and help you to see. Your innocence and sincerity and honesty open wide the portals of the soul to God's great blessings.

May you be truly that child that may embrace God in all its innocence and love. May you know the deep peace of that union. May you feel the warmth and the upliftment of God’s Touch and may all your concerns and earthly desires and conditions fall away from you, my friends, fall away where you may step into the glorious Light of God's Presence. It is here for you at this moment as you all gathered in this Holy place. Absorb, accept, awaken and be present in the great blessings that God has to give to each one of you.

 May God bless you, beloved souls, in the great glory of His Love. I stand with you in your prayers. My love is with you. I am Joseph and may God bless you deeply. Thank you and bless you.
