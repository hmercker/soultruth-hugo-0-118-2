# My Journey to Bring Equality and Love to Mankind

I am Guru Nanak. I am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom and the founder of the Sikh Tradition. When I was a young child my family members knew there was something unique about me. It became more evident to them as I grew into a young boy. At this time in India there were many religions such as the Hindu religion and the Islamic religion. There was also the caste system that was in place, with huge discrimination based on the lineage that you were born into. 

At the age of 11 there is a ceremony in Hinduism where a red string is tied around the child’s wrist, as a ritual or to display and indicate that you are of the Hindu religion. When I turned 11, this was when my family saw more deeply my uniqueness. For I always knew within me that the discrimination between religion and the caste system was not of God. It was of man. So I refused to wear this red string tied around my wrist. 

There was a deep knowing within me that we are all equal, man and woman equal in the eyes of God. So, at a young age, I rebelled against the many rituals and behaviours that discriminated. I became a young adult drawing ever more closely to God in my time of meditation and contemplation. I knew that God was calling me, calling me to make change, to make change in my country. God had set a purpose within my soul. While I walked Earth it was my mission to fulfil this purpose even if it meant being cast out of my own family and my own village which did happen. 

My father rejected me because he wanted me to study as I was born into a high caste. He did not want me to share these beliefs that I held of equality because it was difficult for my father to answer when any of his friends questioned him: *“Why do you not control your son?”* 

I spent long hours in contemplation with God asking for direction and was gifted with teachings, which teachings still exist on your Earth. However there has been change to the original way I taught, just as it is with every religion which over time changes and evolves. But I knew that there was one God: *“Ik Onkar.”* There is one God, a God of love, a God that saw humanity in love, that desired for humanity to live in peace, and that desired for humanity to take care of their brothers and sisters. 

I left my village with my dear companion and friend, walking to different countries and areas adjacent to share the blessing of one God and that the Heart of God is available to each individual. I taught that it was not a ritual or caste that indicated one’s worth, but each individual and their worth was equal to any other. I was challenged greatly as I walked my purpose and my path but I knew that God’s Hand was upon me and was guiding me forward, asking me to be a light and an example of acceptance for all. And this is what I did. I shared food and time, my love and my teachings with those who were cast aside because they happened to be born into a lower caste system. 

I was challenged by those of higher class, asking why such a person as myself who was born into the higher system would share time with those in the lower. It was here I had the great opportunity to share with them that God is Love. We are love and love does not discriminate but love accepts and love shares. 

I continued to walk the Earth offering my message to those who would listen. There were many who did but there were also many who turned away from me. But to those who would listen, I shared my message. The message that I shared, that remains for all eternity, for it is common with all the wonderful teachings that mankind can take into their heart and practice, is that inside us, we are created by God. That is what makes us brothers and sisters. We are created from the same fabric, the same cloth, the same love, the same joy and peace. What matters is how we treat one another, how we care for one another, and how we walk our lives with our mind and our heart and soul focussed on God. 

It is not mere ritual that brings one to God. It is by living with God in your heart and asking God to grow in your heart and to use you as an instrument of the Love that is in your heart and is in your soul. This is what living is for. The equality of humanity is what God sees and gives to each and every one of His blessed children, the same amount of Love, the same value, the same potential, and with unique qualities that God desires to open in each one. 

Just as I have walked my path serving God as deeply as I could with the unique gifts and purpose that I was imbued with, I ask you, each and every one of you to honor that within yourself, to know that God is within you and also around you. Because you have Divine Love in your soul, God resides in you. The Loving Essence of God is in you, the God that desires to know you and for you to know the Love of your Creator. The power, the glory that is available to each and every one of you is limitless and shall grow for all of eternity.

There are beautiful teachings within the Sikh Tradition. Yes you know there are also some teachings that do not carry truth but I am happy with the people of the Sikh Tradition. I to watch them carry out the true teachings of caring for humanity, feeding all and loving all. I would say they are good people in their heart and I know that the untruths that are practiced in this faith will one day shift and change. 

I hope that there is some conscious way that they can receive the teaching of Divine Love for it is one missing ingredient that I was not aware of while I walked the Earth. But I did know that God was Love and I did walk the Earth expressing love. As I transitioned into the spirit world, I found myself in great light. I was blessed to have the Master Jesus come before me and share his message of Truth, the Truth of Divine Love. I was able to receive the blessing and knowledge of this Truth by the one who is our Master. I was very honored to receive that teaching directly from this most humble and gracious soul. I will forever be grateful for his acknowledgment of my work on Earth and for sharing with me the teachings of Divine Love.

There are many of us, who when we walked the Earth were leaders of various faiths and teachings and who now gather together. We work towards bringing Truth into all religions, and the Truth of God’s Love into all religions. Our work continues, beloveds it is never done. We all long and desire to share the Truths of God’s Love for our souls are imbued with this Love. We are Celestial Angels in service of Love and Truth to mankind.

I thank you for hearing my words. I thank you for embracing all humanity equally. Each of you are loved deeply by the Grace of God. I am Guru Nanak. God bless you.
