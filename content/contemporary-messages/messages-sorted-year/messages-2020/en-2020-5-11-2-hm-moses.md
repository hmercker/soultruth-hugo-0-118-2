# Reach for the Highest

May 11<sup>th</sup>, 2020

General Collection, Swakopmund, Namibia

Moses received by Helge Mercker

It is Moses. I speak and bring you my love. Jacob is here too. We bring our love and greetings in prayer.

I come to bring the touch of love and compassion, the embrace of fatherly love to you who seek the path to God, our Heavenly Father. I bring my love in prayer and bring the wisdom of truth as I have experienced it through my life. It brings me joy to come to you as you earnestly seek the Fatherâ€™s Love and His Guidance.

The bush that burned brought me to realizations and awarenesses I never knew existed. It was an experience of faith. An experience in believing what you have seen although initially it makes no sense or has no meaning, but then you start to understand what has been revealed and come to realization.

Bring your joy and love to others and show them how you received this state of harmony and happiness. Share what you know and so it will go on. It is good to feel and hear the word of God. It centers you in His Truth, His Love. The knowing from deep within will lead you and the next steps become clear and open. It will be much easier managing tasks, as they flow in joy and love, in compassion and enriching for all. Come into this great flow and you will see God in all His Glory and Wisdom. Come and bring your love to Him and He will shower you abundantly. Keep on reaching for the highest and the Highest will reach you.

God bless you dear child. Moses greets you. God bless you.
