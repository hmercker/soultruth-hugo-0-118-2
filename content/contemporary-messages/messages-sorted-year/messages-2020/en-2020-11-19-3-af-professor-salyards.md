# Be Joyful in This Venture

November 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Lightbrighters, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

Our dear and beloved Goldie indeed helps to bring the joy into all things. She is right in her encouragement to be joyful, to allow the flow of God's beautiful guidance and Will to come in its good time.

Yes, there is much work to do. You see the great staircase that must be climbed in order to make real your venture and your efforts. But it will be done step by step. It is not meant to be a great burden upon any of you but truly a gift, a loving gift from God to help not only awaken yourselves to your own potentials but to awaken humanity to theirs. This will happen, I promise you. In some way this will be awakened and you will play your part in this awakening of humanity. Although it is a responsibility, it is a joy as well as you come to know who you truly are and align yourself with who and what God truly is.

Blessings to you all, my beloved friends. We will continue, we will continue with joy in our hearts and purpose in our minds and souls, service in love. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your Professor Salyards and close am I to you all. God bless you, God bless you deeply, beloved souls.
