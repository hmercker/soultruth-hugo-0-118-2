Blessings to you, beloved souls, I am Confucius. Allow the blessings of the Father’s Love to reach deep within your souls. As you gather this Great Gift, this Essence of God within you, know that you come closer to the Source of all Love and Light, allowing this Gift to open you further in Light, beloved, beautiful souls, precious souls of God. Carry yourself close to God’s great blessings and as you do so, as you are unified in prayer and Love, so you create a great Portal of Light for the world that God may utilize to send His many blessings fourth. You assist God in this effort to enlighten the world, to bring truth and love, peace and joy. 

Beloved souls, do you not feel the power of this Grace, these great channels of Light and Love flowing amongst you and through you to those you love, to those in the world whom we direct these energies towards, to those who are praying at this very moment for God's blessings? So you dedicate this small time in your day for this work, for these blessings, for all to shower upon you and through you to help awaken humanity to its destiny, which is to come to light and harmony

Beloved souls, do not hold your mind upon set beliefs and ideas, dogmas and rituals, for these things cloud this channel of Love that continues to pour upon you. Instead, be within your souls, that wordless, deep and longing place within you, so that you may receive the abundance that is meant to be given to each of you, that you may indeed be uplifted, and that you may leave those thoughts behind and come to that place of deep feeling, of joy, of bliss, of peace. For, God is with you, beloved souls. God continues to open these Portals of blessings for you all and for many others. Be a part of this great flow and be with God at these moments.

I bless you with the great blessings of healing and upliftment. I come to assist you in this work that we have chosen to do together in the great flow of God’s Will and Love. Blessings to you all, blessings. I embrace each one of you and give to you a blessing. God bless you, beloveds. I am Confucius. My love for you is great. I will continue to monitor your progress, beloved souls, and pray for your continued awakening in Love. God bless you and keep you in His peace and Light. God bless you. Little birds, little birds, I come to feed my little birds. God bless you. God bless you.
