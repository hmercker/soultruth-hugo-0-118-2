May God bless you beloved souls, on this new day. I am Andrew and I wish to assure you that you will continue to forge out into the world, connecting with many other souls. Does this not feel like the rhythm of the waves? At times a pulse of intention and blessings builds within you and flows through you out to others. Then there are times when you await their response and you continue to pray that they will be open to your invitation and that you will continue to be inspired to connect with others. This rhythm, these waves of love and intention will build as you continue in your efforts to be God’s channels of Love in the world. So you feel the excitement in your soul when this crest of the wave builds within you and is released out into the world.

In this way, you will touch many souls because of the possibilities and capacities of your ability to connect upon the wires has opened up many new possibilities of communication, of transmitting the Truth of God’s Love into the world and the power of your work in this regard continues to grow. 

The creative ways in which you utilize these possibilities will continue to multiply, and you will find yourself great initiators of these pulses and waves of love into the world, assuring many souls who often feel alone and alone in their efforts to be a light in the world and they often feel that they are not having a great deal of support and love and appreciation for those efforts. When you reach out in this way, upholding and supporting your brothers and sisters, you give great comfort and you help to build the Lattice of Light that continues to grow in your world and to connect many souls in the process. Though many may have different ideas, different approaches, different perspectives and different beliefs you are all bonded soul to soul. And in this grid of Light, this strengthening bond that continues to grow, it creates a powerful network of Light in the world. 

Do not let your biases hold you from these connections and efforts. Allow yourselves to flow with God’s Will, to be enthusiastic with every soul you meet, to be a loving channel for all. For the power of your efforts helps to build this Lattice of Light. The love that you express with those children you meet creates a powerful bond and allows for many blessings to flow back and forth. Each soul that you meet will contribute something to your understanding, and as you connect with them, you give a great truth that is lodged within the soul of each one; a seed, an important seed planted, a bit more understanding given to those souls who are receptive and who desire to reciprocate your efforts in love. Let yourselves be in the Grace of God. Feel the joy of this great work. Know that you continue on the path ever more powerfully utilized in this work together. 

Beloved souls, you are blessed indeed, given many opportunities and many doors are opened, much possibility continues to be realized and expressed through the light of your souls and the Will of God orchestrating so much. We are with you, as you know. We continue to work with you to forge these possibilities of connection and understanding. We work together. You in your Earthly plane and we in spirit continue in this great venture and plan for the salvation of humanity. 

God bless you beloved souls, I am Andrew. Know that I am with you always. Continue to work in the great effort to interconnect in Love and Light. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
