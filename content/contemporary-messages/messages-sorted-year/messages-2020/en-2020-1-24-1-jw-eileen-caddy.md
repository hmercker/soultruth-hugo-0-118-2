# How Does One Feel the Presence of God?

Eileen Caddy received by Jimbeau Walsh

This is Eileen Caddy. How does one feel the Presence of God? The key word here being “feel”. You can imagine songs of heartbreak touching your heart, making you cry, or a sad story. There is an expiation of sorts that happens when one allows their feelings to overwhelm them, to cry or to expiate that sadness, when one allows the loneliness or the hurt, sadness, heartbreak to break open the heart and open to love. This is why people tend to love sad stories and sad songs because even in the natural love, it puts them in touch with their feelings. Once the feelings are there, when you allow the longings of the soul to connect with God, the inflowing of His Love occurs.

In this world where you live, there are many that pursue enlightenment through the mind. As you have been told many, many times, you cannot connect with God’s Soul through your mind. So all the distractions of this world, physical distractions which please the senses, intellectual pursuits that all bring temporary distraction or relief from the human condition will not suffice in bringing the soul to God.

So if you rest in your longings and you ask God to open your soul to the inflowing of His Love, you will never be denied. So, when one has the thought, “How do I feel the Presence of God?” allow your longings to supersede your thought. Go with your feelings. God will touch you. God will change you. God will transform you and you will open like a beautiful flower, like a rose, like a lotus in the Presence of God.

I thank you. All my love and God’s blessings to each one of you beautiful souls who have come together in prayer. We share this communion with you and we love you. God loves you. I am Eileen.
