God bless you beloved souls, I am Jesus. I come to be with you in your prayers. I come to encourage you in this time of celebration, to celebrate the Great Gift that has been bestowed upon humanity, God’s beloved gift of His Love for the world, His Essence, the Essence of His Soul, which has been given to the world. This is a much greater cause for celebration than the birth of any one person. It is the thing that will transform the world from darkness to light, from error to truth, from pain and anger to love and joy. It is the gift of the Father’s Love that is the reason why I came to the Earth and brought the Truth of this gift to humanity. So I celebrate with you the bestowal of this great gift to the soul, awakening humanity to all that they are, to the beauty that is their soul, to the wonderment which is the expressions of your soul in the world.

As I have said, these things that I did, so you may do and with the inflowing of the Father’s Love, so you will be blessed and awakened and empowered with Love In this way, all the gifts that God wishes to give to humanity and all that is lying dormant within your souls will awaken and manifest in light and bring many blessings forward to all your brothers and sisters. This is what we celebrate in the Celestial Kingdom, the bestowal of God’s Love upon all the souls of your world and ours. This great awakening, the great door open so that we may all come into at-onement with God and know the grace and power and glory of His Love pouring within our souls, awakening us beyond that place of the mind so that we may travel deeper within ourselves and travel further with our souls to God.

This gift, beloved souls, this gift is greater than all gifts, is higher and has the potential to transform your soul and no other blessing can do this. It is the power of God’s Love to transform and awaken and bring you all that is of goodness and joy and peace. 

May this blessing be yours, beloved souls. At this very moment, open your hearts in joyous recognition of the gift that God wishes to bestow upon you. Awaken to your true selves. Awaken to all that is within you. The gracious gift of Life brings much more than just the material expression of it, it brings to you the possibility of much, much more. Come to know it. Come to live it. Come to be Love, and you will be a beautiful light in the world. God will use you to bless many, beloved souls, many who hunger for love, many who are lost in the darkness, many who seek to be awakened but know not how.

May you bring this gift, this joyous gift to all that you meet in this time of celebration. May you sing hosannas to God, thanking God for all that He is and all that He has brought to you. We join you in this. We join you in the great joy of acknowledging God’s Gift to humanity. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Jesus and I pray with you tonight. God bless you, beloveds.
