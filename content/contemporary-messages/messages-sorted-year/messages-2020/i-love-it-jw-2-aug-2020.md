# I love it!

August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2020

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii. U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Care. I will be brief because my dear Jimbeau is quite tired but I wish to say when I overheard your ideas and the guidance about the audio books and the messages *“I love it! I love it! I love It!”*

However you wish to put these together, just be in prayer. Whatever you do in love, and most especially in God’s Love, will be exactly what is called for. I wish to thank the dear sister for following her guidance and presenting this idea. Together you could bring this project to fruition. So we will all guide you and help you in however you choose to amalgamate the different messages into a spiritually cohesive offering. You will know and we give you our blessing. And I give mine. God bless you. Rest easy in the Love of God. I am Care.
