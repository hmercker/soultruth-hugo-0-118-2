I am here, Ann Rollins. I see no need for further introduction as you both know me.  I would like to talk about how one can be believing in things that are less than love and being in God’s Love at the same time, for you know one cannot be in hate and in love at the same time. 

I tell you when anyone prays and asks God to open up their soul to His great Love, He makes no distinction whether that person is a sinner or a saint, rich or poor, Catholic or Jewish or Muslim. The world is filled with mental beliefs and sometimes those who feel they have no say, or voice, will support those who seem to have a strong voice, and in a sense, give a part of their identity to that voice for protection. If that voice is not in love, or of love then that clinging is simply the mind in fear. 

However, when any soul steps aside allowing the deep longings and aspirations of their soul send up a prayer to be at one with the Heavenly Father in His love, in that moment of receiving there is no hatred, there is no enmity, there is no negativity. However vexed that spirit may have been, it is now in condition and in harmony with God’s love and His laws. 

I can tell you that as long as a person clings to the baggage of the mind, the soul can only progress to a certain point where it will await the deeper desire for oneness with its Creator. When that deep desire for God’s Love penetrates, the baggage is let go of and the soul can arise. It is important not to judge but to love. 

This does not mean one needs to associate with those who are not in harmony or wish harm to others, but it does mean you must love them, and with the love of God in your soul. There is no more powerful weapon against negativity and hatred than the Love of God. If you let your souls be in ascendancy, God will do the rest. Do not be troubled. The law of attraction leads every being ultimately to love. Be that magnet in the world my brothers. This is God’s wish for you and mine. I thank this one for taking my message and I will come again. I am your sister in Christ. Ann Rollins.
