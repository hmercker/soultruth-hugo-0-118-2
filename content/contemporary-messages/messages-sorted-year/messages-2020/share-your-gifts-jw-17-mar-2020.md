# Share your gifts

I am here Charles. Some of you know me as Charlie. I am honored that I get to speak to you today and I am allowed because many are sequestered and disconnected from their usual distractions. So it’s a perfect time to share songs of love, to dance with the children, to create art, to give what you know
of this truth of God’s love. There are so many ways to share it without being overbearing, as with humor and song and a lightness. For with every crisis there is opportunity. As the old saying goes: *“when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.”* This you can do.  

You are such beautiful souls and so gifted each one of you. Each one has a unique gift to give to this world. It is amazing. I wanted to share with you that you may share with others your gifts. God bless you.

I am your brother and friend, Charles.
