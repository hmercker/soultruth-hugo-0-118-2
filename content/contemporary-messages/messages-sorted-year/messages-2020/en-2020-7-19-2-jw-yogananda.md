July 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Punalu'u, Oahu, HI, USA

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am your brother and friend and I come in the Grace of God. I am Yogananda. In the vastness of the Universe, all of Creation, let it be known that there is no place where the Love of God and His Presence does not exist. All things in Creation have a oneness in their Source. The gift of the Grace of God, the Presence of God's Love only requires your soul to ask. All of the walls that humans create to protect themselves from pain are dissolved in the Love and the Grace of God for the asking.

This Love pervades the Universe and all of Creation. It is given freely to those who choose to ask as you have in this most beautiful Circle of Light. Can you feel the glow of God's Love in your heart? There are so many here with you embracing you in the Love. When you ask, we are happy to guide you. I ask you to consider this, open your hearts. Open your souls that Godâ€™s Spirit may bring the glorious Love that is His Essence into each one. Beyond fear, beyond doubt, in forgiveness, in trust that there may come to each one, faith, walking in the Light and the Love of our Creator.

Oh, my friends, my dear brothers and sisters, we cannot wish anything greater to be yours. Send out this Love to your troubled world. It is powerful. Send it to the leaders of this world that during this time they may awaken, that this change may truly bring the Grace and the Love and the peace and the sustainability that you all desire for you know this gift of God's Love will never leave you.

We are with you in this prayer in this sacred holy blessing. We are with you in the Love of God. May all be healed and changed. May every blessing, good and perfect gift, be yours. God bless you. I am Yogananda.
