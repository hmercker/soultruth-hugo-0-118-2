# The Grace of Divine Love and at-onement with God

January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020

FUSC, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

Good evening dear friends, I am Keea Atta Kem. I join you in your circle of light this evening as you gather together opening your hearts and opening your souls to the great blessing of Divine Love, this Love, given from the beautiful Soul of the Creator into your soul. This way of communing Soul to soul, God’s Soul to your soul, brought to you by the gift of the Holy Spirit flowing into your soul and blessing you in ways that are unknown to you.  This is a very special circle that you join.  When you gather in such a way with a singleness of purpose to receive the Divine Love, you draw into your midst the Celestial angels.

We are angels who once lived upon your Earth who understand what it is to be human,   these many demands, responsibilities and distractions that are filled by the experience of the human form.  As we each discovered what it is, this Grace of God’s Divine Love and began to pray for this Love to flow into our souls, our prayers were answered just as your prayer is being answered at this moment.  In your midst is the essence, the energy of the Divine Love.  As we continued upon our journey, longing for this Love and this Love making its mark releasing our souls from the pains and the wounds that at one time darkened our souls, a great light began to grow within our souls.  Gifts opened and we could then understand ourselves a little better, know who God is a little more and discover who we are as well.  It is the same for you.  What this Love does is help to open one to desire. To desire this Love, desire to be at-one with the Creator, desire to know who you are drawing you forward to continue to return and receive more. As we, the Celestial friends who come to teach you guide you and influence you continued upon our journey we eventually found the at-onement with God solely by the Grace of Divine Love.  To this day we continue to pray for this Love allowing this Love to bring us ever closer to the Fountainhead of God.  It is an eternal journey one that brings great joy where there was once pain, contentment where there was once disturbance and a love for service.  We are compelled by our souls to be of service and the children of Earth are who we serve.

Open to this great gift of Love, beloveds.  Allow yourselves to experience what this Love will do upon your souls, what this Love will bring into your lives.  It is for each and every soul to discover that which God desires to give them and that which God has implanted within their souls.  Your unique journey cannot be measured by another soul’s journey.  You can let one inspire you to continue forward by what you see happening in them by the Grace of this Love, yet do not measure yourself against another desiring or trying to be as they are for that is not your path.  Your path is to discover your uniqueness and to be you for within you lay thousands of potentials that Gods desires to bring forward to you and through you.  Be the light, the unique light that you are.  Allow God’s handiworks to be evident in your life.  Partner with your Creator to awaken yourself in the wholeness and the pureness of who you are created to be.

There is an ocean of angels in your midst as we speak we are here to serve you.  May you be richly and deeply blessed within your souls by this gift of Divine Love.  Drink deeply of these living waters, this nectar of Love, drink deeply and may you be blessed mightily.

I am Keea Atta Kem.  So happy to speak to you this evening, God bless you.
