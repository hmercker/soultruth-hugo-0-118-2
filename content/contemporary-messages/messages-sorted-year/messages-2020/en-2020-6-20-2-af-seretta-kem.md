Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. The journey ahead for each one of you will be an interesting journey. My beloved brothers, you have no inkling, true understanding of your gifts and what may unfold with your gifts in the future. All is a great mystery and full of potential and possibility. You wonder, *“Who am I in God’s great plan? What am I to do? What road am I to take? How will things unfold in my life?”*

I say to you that with each day, with each prayer, with each lesson learned, with each time in contemplation and discussions such as these, you begin to build the foundation for your gifts and purpose in life. What is a definite is you each wish to serve God, you each wish to find your way upon the path that God has designated for you. With this intention and desire, what God wishes for you to do and what God wishes to give to you upon your personal journeys will unfold in harmony. You will find your way. You will come to know the gifts of your soul. You will come to see those potentials within in a clear light and in a way that they will be expressed in love.

Continue to pray for this gift of the Divine Love for this is what will fuel your journey and the opening of your gifts. Without this, all is merely an image of what can be rather than the substance of what will be. So you must add the substance to the image. You must bring the substance of God’s Love into your souls and aspects of your being, so your soul will open accordingly, beautifully, in harmony, in a beautiful flow of loving actions and wondrous visions and clear understanding, insights, and inspiration.

Yes, God does have a plan. As each of His beautiful children step forward and ascribe to this plan, then the momentum builds and the work begins to expand and unfold in exponential ways in your world. It is your dedication, your desire to step forward in this way that will bring the fruition of your gifts and abilities of the soul to life in this world. This will be a beautiful journey filled with surprising and wondrous adventures and experiences and modes of service for your brothers and sisters.

We await your decision each day in prayer and dedication to acknowledge the desires of your own souls, to acknowledge God’s desire for you, His intention manifest through your souls. All else will follow in the stead of your prayers, your acknowledgement, your openness and your love.

May God bless you on this journey, beloved souls. May this journey be straight and swift for you are needed. You are needed. Allow God to work through you. Allow God to transform you. Allow God to guide you forward and all will come in the great onrush of His Love, the great Light that flows towards you and your awakening soul.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem and I will continue to assist you in your awakening, the unfolding of your gifts, and all that is meant to be in your life. Many others also are involved in this birthing of your soul in Light and Love. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
