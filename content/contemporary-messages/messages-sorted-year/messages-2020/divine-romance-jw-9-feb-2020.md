I am here Yogananda. My dear friends you have come together in Presence of God in the glow of His love drawn here by the deep longings in your souls to be at One in love with God. This is a Divine romance you have chosen and it is unlike any other. As you open to this love, all that is not of love begins to dissolve, to fall away and you feel this joy throughout your being. 

You may wonder at times, How do I decide whether or not to pursue this or that, or take this path or another? If you do so with your mind, you will have some kind of logical conclusion. When you reach into your soul you will feel that which is the way of love and the way of joy. I will give you an obvious example here: Think of the vast sums of money that are spent on advertising attempting to get your attention to purchase this or that so you can be beautiful, sexually appealing, unique, successful and satisfied. If these means of grabbing your attention did not work no one would use them. But in fact, they do grab the attention and often they appeal of course to very base desires. 

The other side of this equation is the Celestial realm which also wishes for your attention because the deep desires you have to feel this love Divine must supersede all other desires. This is soul food. As you consider what to put in your bodies, what is healthy, what satiates your palate consider what you take in, what you watch, what you read, what you listen to, for the sake of your soul. This soul food, this love of God, this is worthy of your attention. All else will find its place. So consider what you choose to take in and go from the deep longings in your souls to decide so that you may live in joy.

You needn’t be obsessed with the darkness, with the troubles of this world and I know your hearts are touched by the sufferings of others. I say consider staying in the love of God that you may truly touch every soul, so that you will become a magnet drawing in those who wish to feel this love to be healed, to be in joy. They will ask and you can respond in truth: *“May your soul be touched by God’s love.”* Each one of you come with this desire so bring it to the world. 

My dear friends you are so blessed. I leave you with my love, my blessings and all of us here embrace you in the Creators love. May God bless you and transform you. Peace, I am Yogananda.
