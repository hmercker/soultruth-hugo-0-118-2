Andrew received by Al Fike

God bless you, I am Andrew. We continue to take you deeper into the realms of soul to soul communication, to develop within you this capacity and this blessing to know one another in this way. You will find as time goes by and you continue to pray for the Father’s Love, that your ability, your gift and faculties to communicate, not only with one another but with us, will increase and become more refined. The more you sit in this Circle of Light and join with others in these efforts of Light, so you will find new faculties and gifts, abilities opening to each one of you. As you walk this Path Divine, so you invite deeper parts of yourself to emerge into consciousness. You will know God is close always. You will walk in this beautiful Light that God will surround you with and keep you in this Light of protection and Love, this glowing Light that will be used to bless others as you walk upon your path in daily life.

Do not limit yourselves in your thinking and your doing. Know that there are so many unknown gifts, unrecognized, undeveloped, but as you continue to grow in the Father’s Love, so you will find these gifts emerge and be expressed through your being. There will be many surprises for each one of you. There is much that continues to strain and yearn to be awakened and true to your conscious self. God brings you into alignment with all that is of His Love and His Soul. Let yourself be lifted into greater Light, to walk with the joy and knowing that you are Loved.

I am with you, beloved souls. As you well know, many angels are with you and shall continue to walk in the Light of God’s Love and Truth, His Divine Path illuminating your way. May God bless you and keep you close to all that is in harmony with God’s Laws of Love, God’s Presence and the presence of your angel friends. God bless you beloveds, I am Andrew. My love is with you. God bless you.
