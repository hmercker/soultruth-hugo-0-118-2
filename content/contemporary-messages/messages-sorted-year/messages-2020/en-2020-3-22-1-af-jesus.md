Jesus received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I come. I am Jesus. You have nothing to fear, beloveds, for I have told you many times that I will lead you into light and so I will. Have faith in God. Have faith in the angels that surround you each one. Have faith in the journey that God wishes for you to take as He continues to awaken your souls. So, the path will be made clear and the understanding will come to each of you so that you are not fearful nor confused but come into the light of Truth.

Know that I am with you, that God's protection surrounds each one of you. For, you have come to God in times of need. You have come to God to open your soul to His Love, to feel the joy of life, to be at peace. So these things shall be blessed to each soul who asks and has great faith in the Will of God. I bless you, beloved souls. I bless you. Feel the comfort of God’s Touch upon you. Feel the Love that is God’s Essence surrounding you. Know that His healing pours upon your bodies and your soul. You will all be uplifted. You are in the Grace of God.

God bless you. I am with you always. God bless you.
