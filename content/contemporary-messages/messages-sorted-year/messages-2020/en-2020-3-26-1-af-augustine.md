# Now is the Time to Answer the Invitation to Seek Harmony through Prayer

Augustine received by Al Fike

It is Augustine, your teacher. As the winds of change blow across your world, are you not seeing how inadequate humanity is in its ability to bring harmony and healing in the face of destruction and danger? Despite all the efforts of all the souls upon your world to protect itself from the conditions of nature, the conditions that threaten the very stability of your cultures of the world, you feel impotent, beloved souls, because what God has created is far greater than what humanity has created.

It is time to look beyond the false security of those creations of man and seek a true relationship with God. This question comes to you all, does it not? What will become of me? What will become of this world? As you see now that you are vulnerable and that the forces of the world are powerful indeed. Now is the time for prayer, beloved souls. Now is the time to put aside that mindful, egotistical view that you are all powerful, that you are able to control your lives and control this world.

In fact, the world controls you, beloved souls. The variances and energies of your world will determine your fate, though you do indeed have free will. You do indeed have the capacity to choose wisely in your world. So few truly understand what this is, what this power contains. God gave you many gifts, beloved souls. God gave you many potentials. God did indeed give you the gift of free will. Your challenge and every soul’s challenge who comes into the world is to discover what is possible, discover one’s own potentials and possibilities, and discover what is in harmony with the creation of your world, of God’s Creation.

Now is the time, beloved souls, to truly understand what is in harmony with God’s Creation. To do so, you must go to God. You must go with humility, with desire, with an openness and a longing from your soul to be in communion with God, to be aligned with God. For through this time that you are experiencing in your world and what is to come, this is the invitation that is given. Be with the Creator in your hearts and souls and mind. Seek to know what this is. Seek to know your own true selves, to be in harmony with God, to be in harmony with your own true self, to be in harmony with the Creation in which you abide and are an integral part of.

So, your world is in disarray, many changes, many reactions. Many things are not as they seem nor are they as you wish. I say to you, beloved souls, now is the time for introspection and contemplation. You have been given a gift, beloved souls, to be in that Grace of God, to be in that place of peace, to have time to think, to pray, to be centered within your own self. Utilise this time, beloved souls. I urge you, as a member of the Celestial Kingdom, an angel of God whose soul has been redeemed by His Love, to pray for this gift, this gift of God’s Love, for this transformative energy, blessing will truly change you and give you the insights that you require to truly understand what is happening in your world at this time and what is meant to be in your world in times to come.

The faculties and insights of the soul will bring you to that place of understanding. It is not your minds, beloved souls, it is not your minds that will answer these question. But instead, a deeper place, a place that you all must take time and effort to discover and nurture. Prayer is your rock and foundation in this regard. Go to God in prayer. Ask for God’s Blessings upon your soul. Ask for God’s Essence to enter your soul and find for yourself the answers that you seek. Find for yourself the stability in a world that is rapidly changing and creating conditions that are difficult and disruptive. Find for yourself a deep peace, a strength, and a knowing that a soul awakened will know and feel and be a part of.

You are all God’s children and as such, you are loved deeply by God. Seek out His Love. Seek out that which will bring you insight and comfort and strength. Then, as each soul comes to that place of understanding, comes to reconcile themselves with their Creator, then the true healing will begin of your world and each soul within it and all that abides in it.

May God bless you on that journey, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I will help you to understand what is happening in your world and happening within yourself. God is issuing a serious and deep invitation to you all to look within, to seek Truth within you, and to seek God in your lives. God bless you, beloved souls, and may His Love pour into your souls in great abundance opening up those portals of understanding and Truth, Love, and peace. God bless you. I am with you and I am your friend who seeks to comfort and help and assist you upon your journey. God bless you. I am Augustine, Bishop of Hippo when on Earth, now an angel within the Celestial Kingdom. God bless you. My love is with you.
