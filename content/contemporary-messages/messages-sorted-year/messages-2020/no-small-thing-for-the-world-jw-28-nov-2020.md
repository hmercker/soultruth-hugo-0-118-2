# No Small Thing for the World

November 28<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your sister Clare. 

My dear kind mice how wonderful to be with you. To hear your concerns and to feel the joy in your hearts. To know the intentions of your souls and the longings for the love of God. 

It is no small thing to realize that every soul is worthy of receiving the Father’s Love and all His children are the objects of His Love, His care, His mercy. You are also worthy of being treated with love, respecting each other. And although I don’t like to use the word ‘demand’ I will say you can insist that others speak to you in a loving and kind manner. For that is a simple request and you are all deserving of respect. If you feel a lack of respect or love from any group, any individual, feel free to walk away and insist on a level of civility of harmony. Ask for our protection, ask for our assistance. If you go directly to God ,even with the simple request, “please help me, protect me, provide for me, and above all, bless me with your love, you will receive an answer. I ask you not to worry, for worry creates a wall between you and your Creator, between you and those of us in the Celestial heavens, even between you and your own heart. Lastly, know we are assisting you and trust that your prayers are being answered. 
 
My sisters and I, we not only removed ourselves from the busyness of the world, but to a large extent, from words. We would often designate one person to communicate with the outside world as we prayed. We certainly sang together, in joy, in praise, and in harmony, yet our silence, produced more good than an abundance of words. You may let your love speak for you. You may ask to be spoken to with love. This message is intended not only for my dear kind mice, but for the world, which so needs it. With all my heart and the love of God I shall now leave you.  Be at peace. I am Clare of Assisi. Go with God.
