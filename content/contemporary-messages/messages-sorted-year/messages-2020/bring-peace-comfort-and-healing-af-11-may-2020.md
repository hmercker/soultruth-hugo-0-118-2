Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. Where there is strife, may you sow peace. Where there is suffering and loneliness, may you sow the blessings of God as a channel of love to bring comfort. Beloved souls, there is much you can do to bring peace and comfort, love and healing as God channels in the world. As you pray, may you be inspired. May you walk this Earth as a channel of Light and Love. May you continue to seek the guidance of God and the guidance of your angel friends. May you continue to find unity amongst yourselves in your efforts to be lights in the world, that the great power of God's Love continues to unify soul to soul, bringing harmony amongst you. 
Though you each have your unique lives, your unique experiences and perspectives, within your soul is a great bond of love, one to the other, and a great and deep desire to be in the Grace of God. Seek to be in that Grace, beloved souls, to be within your souls so that you understand that of which I speak is true and clear to you, that the awakening of your souls for receiving this Great Gift of God's Love will bring these realisations, this peace, this harmony and unity into your lives, with ever stronger effects and expressions of the soul.

Each of you come together and long for this gift. Each of you know this and recognise this, with your brothers and sisters in prayer. Each of you will indeed become a powerful instrument for God as you continue to band together and walk this journey together, towards God at-onement, His love flowing, guiding, transforming and awakening. You are not alone, beloved souls. Every moment, an angel is with you. Every moment, God, in His great compassion and love for each of you, continues to pour His blessings forth; continues to allow the great efforts of the Holy Spirit, the blessings of His Soul to your soul, to be a part of your lives and experiences in prayer, in contemplation, in action.

You are deeply blessed, beloved souls. You are deeply blessed. Know that we are with you. Know that God is with you and the blessings of His Touch continue to awaken you and bring you a sense of deep peace and joy. It is given to you, beloveds, given freely, given abundantly, given joyfully. May you receive all that is offered, awaken to all that is transformed within you, and the faculties of your soul coming to life with the Touch of God's Love.

God bless you, beloved souls. May God keep you in His Love and great peace and joy. I am your teacher Augustine. I'm happy to pray with you tonight as you reach out once more for the Holy Touch of God upon your souls. God bless you. God bless you beloveds. My love is with you.
