# The Lattice of Light is Like a Netting Over the World Joining All Together

January 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

I join you in your Circle of Light over the wires. I am Keea Atta Kem. You continue to be drawn together in this way, expanding and strengthening this Lattice of Light that acts like a netting over your world, joining each one of you, joining your souls in these beautiful threads woven over your planet, bringing it beautiful Light that we, from our viewpoint, see. We continue to encourage you, to love you, and to guide you, each one of you as you progress along your personal path, strengthening in the understanding and the awakening of your souls, coming to recognise this part of you that is awakening, that has gifts to share and is compelled to create action, to unfold in creative ways for the blessing of this expression of Love and Truth in all of your environments.

For, your soul serves and has the potential to serve in all moments. It is not only when you gather in these beautiful Circles or when you travel to the far-off lands, gathering in what you call retreats. Your soul has a desire to express its love in all moments. As you recognise this and see these moments before you, with every step that you take upon your Earth and you awaken to this beauty that is in you, the desire for service, to share love and to spread Truth in genuine ways that another may be able to receive, these beautiful awakenings continue to be expressed from your soul. It is like a muscle strengthening. Each time that your soul has the opportunity to express itself in its Truth, it gains strength.

Often it is the mind that will inhibit the deeper Truths and knowings to be expressed from your soul. We ask you to be aware of this, these two parts of you, mind and soul, in being cautious and aware when your mind is trying to dictate that which your soul desires to express.

As this muscle strengthens and grows and expands and is nourished by the Love of God, you will find along your journey that there will not be a stopping from your mind for there will come great harmony where these two places in you operate together, harmoniously expressing. As this occurs, there is great peace, contentment, and a deep knowing of who you are, who God has created you to be, and the Light of your soul will shine forward in ways that you have not the capacity to understand and recognise, at this point in time.

My dear friends, continue along this journey, allowing your soul to gain strength, to waken and to give it this place, an opportunity for expression. In this way, beloveds, your journey is rich and your life’s experiences will deepen. There will be a deep sense of fulfilment within you that you are fulfilling your purpose and you are, beloveds, for every soul has a common purpose and that is to awaken in God’s Love. So you are well on your way.

My love is with you. I am Keea Atta Kem. It is a great joy to see so many souls gathered in such a way to share the Love of the Creator, to share the glory of how God’s Love is working within their lives, and how God’s Love can surpass all of the details and wonderment of the mind. God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem and my love is with you.
