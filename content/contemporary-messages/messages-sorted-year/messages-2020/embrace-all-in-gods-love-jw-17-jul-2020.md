I am here Francis your dear brother, and you are my dear brothers. I make no demands as we only suggest and encourage. We wait patiently for our influence and our advice, which is always given in love, to be accepted. For the message is always about love; this you know and above all things, the Love of God, to pray for it, to receive it. If you wish to be truly wealthy this is what you wish to possess. All else is superfluous. This is not to say that one should dismiss the needs of others for food and shelter, for love, but to say the one thing that is worth carrying with you into spirit, the most precious thing, the most valuable thing, is the Love of God. And even this God does not demand but only offers with open arms.

We who have been transformed in this Love, redeemed, changed from mortals to the Celestial Kingdom as angels, we say: *“Be kind to each other, embrace all in God’s Love.”* Cherish your friends and family and be grateful that you have discovered the truth. Let this holy communion be your template, be your guide, and when you are moved to be in communion and community with others who are open to receive the grace of God and His Divine Love consider that choice. For the intentions of all in the circles of light is to receive this great gift whatever the person, wherever they are on their journey, so encourage them, for all need love, all are wounded. Is there a single soul who is without a flaw that can cast the first stone?

We encourage you to be in communion to support all those who wish to be transformed in the Love whatever their station. For first it is important to take care of one's own house and then assist others. I say this with all the love in my heart and the Grace of God in my soul. God bless you. I am your brother in Christ, Francis.
