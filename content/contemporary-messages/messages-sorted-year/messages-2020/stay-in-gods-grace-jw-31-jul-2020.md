I am here your brother and friend in God’s Love and His Grace, I am Francis. When you come together from the longings in your souls to receive the greatest gift of the Heavenly Father's Love, you receive this blessing and you carry it with you. 

If the choice is between seeing your flaws and resting in the Grace of God I encourage you to rest in God’s Grace and spend less time looking at your flaws, trying to understand them, beating yourself up and feeling unworthy. For you know as a child of God, you are worthy. And when you walk in God’s Love and grace you rise above whatever condition you were heretofore concerned about. It is human to err, it is Divine to Love. Is this not what is said? 

So on this day on Earth be grateful be humble knowing you are worthy to allow the Love of God to shine from your souls without complaint. As we praise our glorious Creator we bring a blessing to all.  May you walk with the angels. 

May you talk with love that your words are a blessing, lifting all in the sweet music of praise and the fragrance of the flowers. May you open like a rose in the Love of God. I am your brother in Christ and I love you. I am Francis.
