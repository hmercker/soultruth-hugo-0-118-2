Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Hafiz the poet and you are in your galaxy - a pinpoint in the vast universe of the Creator living on a microcosmic dot in an expanding universe and yet there is a beam of light connecting each one to the Source. This connection facilitated by love and brought about by each one seeking this love in the spiritual hunt where the prey captures the hunter. 

The Creator in His wisdom makes it possible. How is anything possible? How are we breathing? Living in a world full of darkness and yet full of light. Full of death and full of life. You who have discovered the majesty of the love Divine. You have discovered the great treasure that our glorious Creator has given. No one would walk away from such riches.

In Godâ€™s love I am your friend, Hafiz
