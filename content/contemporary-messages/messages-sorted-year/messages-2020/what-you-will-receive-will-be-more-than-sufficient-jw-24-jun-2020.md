# What you will receive will be more than Sufficient

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your friend and brother Judas.  

Again, I tell you yes, it is me. I was drawn into your conversation and even more so into your prayer. 
  
I wish to explain to you why there is a sense of discrepancy in your mind about what you received. It’s not complicated. I came to you earlier and we discussed this idea of prayer and the gospels and the B.S. meter as you call it. And you wished to get up from your bed and write this down or record it, but I told you I would come later, and I did. And your mind was concerned that you would get it right and you would include everything while at the same time you were very clearly receiving from me. And these fields didn’t always meet in a perfectly harmonious place, nevertheless my message about the words of Jesus, the love that emanated from him, how each word, each story, was a prayer unto itself, and set the longings in our souls aflame, that message, reached many.  
   
So, do not be disturbed and know it is me. What comes through you will be very different than what came from the other dear brother. For those who wish to hear the truths who wish to feel God’s Love and pray and be changed what you receive will be more than sufficient. Of course, it will be dependent upon your desire and wish to do so. 
  
I am very happy with what you have received, and I like it when you feel safe and comfortable as you do with this dear sister. There is much light surrounding you two and you will bring it to the dear sister coming back from her procedure. Other Celestials will come to you and bless you and help you on your journey, so please, please, do not be disturbed in any way about any of this. 
   
Stay in God’s love as you can and Who will lift you above this world and will enable you to be a blessing to all. So be it. With all my love and in God’s grace I come to you as a redeemed soul, a disciple of the master and an inhabitant of the Celestial heavens. Know that I am your brother and friend, Judas of Kerioth.
