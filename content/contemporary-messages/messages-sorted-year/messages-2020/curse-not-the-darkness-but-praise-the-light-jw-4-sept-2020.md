I am here Yogananda. My brothers and sisters, I come to you with the love of God in my soul, as you pray for the love of God to be in your souls. I wish for you to consider this: There are two ways to approach life. You can approach it from the point of view of everything that needs to be corrected, everything that's wrong, every hurt, every sin and error in this world. Or, you can approach it by embracing all in the love of God, seeing the light and love and bringing that to the darkness. We come and we will not curse the darkness but we bring the light that those in darkness may be healed, that their eyes may be opened with the light of love, that they may be lifted as you are lifted, in the glorious grace of God.

If God is not your goal then you will be mired in the affairs of the world. So consider where you wish to be. Where you wish your heart to be opened to. Are we going to be a blessing to this world or are we just going to rail at it? We needn't buy in to the negativity for it is harmful for the progression of your souls. I am not saying this is a retrograde step but it can cause stagnation and the inability of letting go of those things which allow your soul to be transformed in every moment in the love of God. Is this not your desire? Is this not your stated goal?

Consider what you choose in every hour in every moment to the best of your ability. I do not wish to come and be in judgment but to encourage. I do this out of my love for you. Imagine Gods' love for you how great it is, imagine the world being open to Gods love? A world utterly changed from the darkness into light. **So curse not the darkness but praise the light and the love of God.** Bring it to every soul. This I ask of you my dear brothers and sisters. This the celestial angels ask of you. For as the great president once stated: *“a house divided cannot stand.”* And as another leader entreated: *“Keep your eyes on the prize.”* These two great souls, let them be your guides in the love of God. With all my love and blessings to you both and to all of you that this message may reach. I come to you in the grace of God, your brother in Christ, your friend and guide. I am Yogananda. God bless you.
