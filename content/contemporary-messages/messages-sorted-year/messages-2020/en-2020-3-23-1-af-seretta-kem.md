# The Conditions Now Are an Opportunity to Test the Truths of God's Love

March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020

Gibsons Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Friends, I am Seretta Kem. The conditions in which you are living at the moment give you a great opportunity to test the Truths of God’s Love. For, you do not understand the power of God’s Love to any great degree although many of you have been praying for this gift for some time. Might I suggest that as you pray for this gift and receive it, you are also creating a condition around your physical body and presence in the world that will repel those conditions that are not conducive to your health and well-being as well as your soul’s light.

This is the power of God’s Love enacted in your lives, beloved souls. As you continue to grow in this gift, I would recommend that you would observe that what you draw to you is in harmony and what you repel from you is not. Though you are subject to free will in this world, you have within you a favored gift, the gift of God’s Love that has its influence and expression through your beings.

We have asked you to be a channel of love as you walk in this world. We say that you are protected, that you are dearly loved. Part of this protection is that you will not be susceptible to the earthly conditions that are present at this time, as long as you are within the flow of God’s Love. I am not suggesting that you should throw caution to the wind, as you say, but I am saying that you have nothing to fear. Even if you are one who is susceptible to this disease that is spreading around your world, you will not succumb to this disease. You will be assisted by the angels. You will be given healing, great healing, to help you to overcome this threat to your body.

So I urge you, beloved souls, do not fear. Do not overly concern yourself with the possibility of infection and even demise from this. Rather focus your time, efforts and thoughts upon God and walk in the flow of His Love. In this way, you utilise a powerful force, a force that will repel dark conditions.

When you serve God and you go out in the world to serve your Heavenly Father and those who are dark and even sickened, you will not receive this blight within your body, provided you are within that flow of God’s Will and Blessing. Such is the power of God’s Love. There are many things, many aspects of this Divine Love active within your soul that can manifest through you and bring great Light around you as this Love aligns you with God’s Great Soul and this Love awakens the gifts of your soul.

So the powers of these gifts, the expressions and the manifestations of these gifts of a soul awakened, will bring much benefit, not only to yourselves but those around you. You must walk in faith, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, not fear. Of course you must exercise a measure of caution. It is important that you consider your steps in the world, not being foolhardy but being wise.

But I say to you, as long you are guided, as long as the angels are with you, as long as you continue in your efforts to be in alignment with God, you are protected. The power of God’s Love is great, as a healing agent, as an agent that transforms darkness into light, an agent that opens up those gifts within you that may heal others. I implore all of you to utilise the power of prayer for the healing of your brothers and sisters, so many who are suffering at this moment, so many who are in a great state of fear and anxiousness and concern for the future. With your prayers you may be a channel of love and peace for those who are in a state of disturbance. You may also be channel of healing from your homes to those who are in need. Distance does not matter when God utilises your gifts for the benefit of others.

When you marry your understanding of the power of Love and the power of prayer, so you become a potent force in the world for light and healing, comfort and love. Allow yourselves to be used in this way. Focus your intentions and your desires. Set aside a time each day to pray for healing for your loved ones and for those you know are in need of this gift. Take time each day to be with God. The more you can pray, beloved souls, the more you can activate this power, this energy of love and healing in the world. So few understand these laws, beloved souls. So few can be activated like  yourselves because of what you know and have implemented in your lives. Utilise your knowledge, your gifts, your faith, and the power of your souls that are constantly being transformed by the power of the Father’s Love.

A great antidote to the conditions of this world, each of you have this potential to help rectify the conditions of your world and bring greater harmony. Do not underestimate the power of your being in relationship with God. As God builds this great channel between yourself and His Great Soul, so the Energies of God, the Blessings of God, the Love of God flow through this channel, flow through as God’s channel. Much can be accomplished in this way. Even if you are alone in your room, isolated from others, this does not mean that you cannot connect spiritually, socially soul to soul with another or with many others. As you do so at this moment, so you may do so through your days at any time in prayer, in a desire to be God’s channels of love and light.

Use this time wisely, beloved souls. In some ways, it is a gift, a gift that can bring about many blessings for yourself, awaken many things within yourself, and allow many things to flow through you for the benefit of this world. Come to know your true selves, beloveds, your own soul, the power of your soul, the power of that light within your soul, the power of your relationship, your bond of Love with God. All of these things working together in harmony will bring about a powerful flow of light into your world and into your being. Blessed are the children who have a great desire to serve God and to be with God. Blessed are you, beloved souls, who are in alignment, who desire to be with the highest Truth, the greatest Love, the most powerful of all gifts and blessings.

You are blessed, beloveds. You are blessed and shall continue to be blessed as you continue to be in alignment with God. Fear not, beloved souls. Be in joy. Experience the joy of this relationship. As God continues to flow His Love towards you, blessings abound, Light is bright, Love envelopes you all.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. I am happy to speak to you today. May you continue to seek and know the Truths of God. God bless you. God bless you all.
