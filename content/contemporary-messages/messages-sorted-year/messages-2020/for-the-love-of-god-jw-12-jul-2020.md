# For the Love of God

July 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your sister Care. I am here as you are for the Love of God. Remember that whatever you do can be for the Love of God and if this be your guide, you cannot falter. Here in the Celestial realm everything we do is for the Love of God and in the Love of God, and with the Love of God. This allows us to open many doors and we do not judge those who close their doors to us but we invite all: *“Open the door to your heart that the Father may bless you with His Love.”*

We do not have these debates about whether the Love is available because it is and that we know and that we feel and that we bring with us. And we come to you as you receive it and our only wish is that you bring this Love to all without judgement.

I wish to say something personal to my beloved. There are many demands made on you at this time dear one. And I know you feel overwhelmed at times. And when people come to you who love you and ask for your time because they wish to help you to assure you, and to support you in your work, even this is sometimes felt as a demand and often it comes with a lot of advice and once again you are overwhelmed. However when you come together with people in prayer and in song and in Praise of the Father and for His Love, all of those pressures disappear because the Love of God permeates your prayer and is felt by all who are open to it.

So my dear, decide what you wish to do and with who and when and if you feel overwhelmed then you can excuse yourself. For I know you do not wish to argue or defend your position but rather be in the joy that is in your soul and in my soul in God’s Love. Point your compass in this direction always and I will be with you. 

May the blessing of God’s Love be with you and your dear brother throughout this day and the eve, and bring you much joy and happiness as you allow your souls to be filled. All my love and blessings to you both my dear brothers and my beloved. I am Care. Go with God!
