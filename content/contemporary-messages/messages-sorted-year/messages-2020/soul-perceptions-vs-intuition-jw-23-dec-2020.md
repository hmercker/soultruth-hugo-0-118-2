# Soul Perceptions v.s. Intuition

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your sister and friend and beloved, Care.  It is easy enough to be concerned and to have empathy for those who live in darkness and for their blindness of their souls in the world when you are all seeking the light and to see clearly yourself and to serve. Please remember help is always available when you go to God in prayer, He answers. When you need guidance, it arrives. Sometimes in the form of a Celestial Angels or a progressive spirit in God’s love, and sometimes God just puts the answer in your heart, in your soul and you know.

There is a difference, a distinction between soul perceptions and having a feeling about something or intuition. Intuition tends to be more in the mind and in the natural, but it can be very helpful. Soul perceptions are, I may say, Divine intuition, perceiving reality in the workings of God’s laws and in the flow of His grace when you are in harmony allowing His Holy Spirit to work through you. This is where you feel as if there is a light on in your heart and you wish so much to share that with others. I have seen all of you do this and know it is your deep desire and I encourage you to bring that to your day as often as you can. You know this is not a great discipline because the results are so harmonious.  

When you give, you receive tenfold in return and we celebrate this here in the Celestial realm and you feel it. So when you are concerned about another and their state of being, their state of mind, their troubles, or perhaps they have offended you in some way, send them love, support them in the flow of God’s grace. Lift them up and encourage them with love as you so often do. I only remind you how great this is and how happy it makes me and all those here. The true gift of the season is the love of God that you have been “Christed” as Jesus promised. May you continue to spread the joy and the truth and the glow of Divine love in your hearts to all. I wish you every blessing, every good and perfect gift in God’s love and I love you. God bless you. I am Care.
