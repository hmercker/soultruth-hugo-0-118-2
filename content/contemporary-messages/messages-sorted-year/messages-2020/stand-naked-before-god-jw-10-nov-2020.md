# Stand Naked before God

November 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here Francis the one who sang and preached and walked the hills of Assisi. I wish to add, if I may, to the insightful remarks of my [brother Yogananda.](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2020/allow-god-to-change-you-jw-10-nov-2020) 

When I had my awakening, I saw the world for what it was, that the world lived impoverished in spirit. When I felt the touch of God’s Hand upon me, I knew I could let go of everything and there I was standing naked, proclaiming my mission and my desire to live in the richness of God’s Love and the poverty of simplicity. 

Only God could change me, this I knew. But I would have to take that step towards God and this I would like you to consider. I don’t mean you all need to take off your clothes and go live in the woods, (laughs) but you do need to stand naked before God spiritually and allow God to change you. Make your consciousness your desire to live in Grace and it will be so.  

I leave you now to be with you in silent prayer. May God bless you. All my love to each one of you. I am your brother in Christ. I am Francis.
