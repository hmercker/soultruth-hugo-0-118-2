Sri Yari Supta received by Maureen Cardoso

Greetings from spirit, I am Sri Yari Supta. Welcome once again to your circle, each one of you opening your souls to receive the great gift of the Father's Love, attracting an angel into your midst who works upon you helping clear the blocked energies within your own body, helping to release these mental inhibitions that all humans carry where you may more easily rest yourself in the stillness of your soul and allowing the essence of your soul to be awakened and your healing gift developed.

You are indeed a blessed group of souls gathering in this way. So many from the Celestial heavens attend to you. We are watching as the many changes on your earth continue to unfold. We are watching the intensity of God's plan for the salvation of mankind unfold, increasing the desires within your own souls to awaken and to be instruments of Love and healing. Whether you are aware of any changes within your physical body to this gift of healing is of no consequence to its development. And every time that you enter into prayer and yearn deeply from your soul, God touches all of your gifts. Yet the gift of healing is one that all souls to some degree have been imbued with for the Father knows that the journey upon earth is filled with struggle and pain, and it is His desire and intention to develop the gifts that each one of you carry so that you may help your brothers and sisters.

As this is a soulful journey within the mind you may not understand fully the workings of this gift. All it requires, beloveds, is your trust and a knowing that this gift is developing. This preparation time is very important for we see a little further ahead than you can as to what is unfolding on your earth, and we know in time each one of you will have many opportunities to help your brothers and sisters in various ways. Keep your thoughts for the highest about your gift, beloveds, and know that God does need you and know that within your soul is a deep desire to have this gift awakened and its instrumentality utilized.

As you continue to shift within the soul and these awarenesses come into your consciousness, there will be a deeper stability and knowing within you that indeed your gift is active. We have said before, it may be a word, it may be a glance, it may be a smile, a touch, or simply through your presence sitting next to one another, walking into a room and the energies that flow from your soul and your body can affect a sense of ease and upliftment for another. You recognize this when you feel the presence of us coming into your midst, how the atmosphere changes, you feel the loving presence that we bring. Well, dear ones, so too is it with you. Your beautiful essence that emanates from you, your soul filled with God's Love, awakened in its desire, and the healing gift flowing shall touch many. Your humility and your love for God and how God works through you is what shall continue to have these doors open and these energies flow.

The union that you carry within you, your deep soul to God's deep soul, brings forth humility. To know that God is working through you is a great blessing to many and there is a sense of responsibility that comes with such a gift, or any gift that is opened. It requires you to be in good spiritual condition, to know and understand that you are walking in this world but not of this world. This makes for a powerful instrument for God when you can see through the light of your soul the needs of others without judgement. When you can hold compassion and understanding, your gift shall flow freely. And as you continue to heal and awaken, this shall be your experience. Some are near to having this experience flow through them and others are yet to continue in their development and a time awaits them when this shall be their experience as well. But each beautiful soul who desires to have their healing gift awakened, so shall it be, so shall it be, beloveds.

There is so much love from the Celestial heavens pouring down upon you now, God's Love flowing into you. Receive this now, open your soul allowing God to touch you deeply. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. God bless you.
