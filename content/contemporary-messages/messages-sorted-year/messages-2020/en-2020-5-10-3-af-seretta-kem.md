# We Continue to Test and Develop You as Your Gifts Unfold

May 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Direct Voice, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

We continue to test and develop and test again as you are intent upon opening your gifts and the flow, the development of this one gift, Direct Voice, and other gifts of spirit communication. So you have kept us very busy of late with all the souls intent upon honing their capacities and abilities to communicate with us. To have this network of communication and information transferred from one to another, from spirit to mortal, from mortal to mortal, from mortals to God, all of these ways of communication, all of these ways of understanding one another and God.

In order to open these lines of communication, we must work diligently to insure that these channels are clear, that your intentions are pure, that your efforts are in alignment with God and we leave little to chance. We are always intent on developing those instruments who have the desire for the highest good, who walk this Path Divine, who are in alliance with us and with God so that His plan may unfold powerfully and effectively in the world.

Yes, in times to come, these communications not only between we in spirit and you in the flesh, but between all of us, will be of importance, will assist in this work in many different ways. Whether it be through the manifestation of spirit or whether it be through communication soul-to-soul, mind-to-mind, and all the complex channels and ways of doing so, you become an integral part of a powerful network. Your part is not that of someone blindly moving through the world but consciously a part of something that is deeper and wider than the human consciousness, something that is attuned to Divine Consciousness so that you will then be able to assist your brothers and sisters.

For as you receive information and inspiration, as many Truths are given, as we assist you so that you may know what is happening in your world on many dimensions and will be able to share, to give to one another that piece of the picture that you are able to receive. You are on the verge of much awakening of soul faculties and of psychic gifts. All of these elements within you are coming together and opening many doors of Truth, channels of love, capacities to assist your brothers and sisters.

There is little now that holds you back from these abilities. Day by day you will see an unfolding of rich faculties within. First it will be a small rivulet that will come into your consciousness, and eventually this will turn into a mighty torrent. Something so powerful and beautiful that it will be breathtaking in its scope, glorious in its washing over all of you carrying you along God’s Great River of Love.

Continue to pray that your gifts be open, beloved souls. As you pray earnestly for the Father’s Love to enter your soul, know that in these prayers gifts will come in good time. Your soul will bear fruit, beloveds. Your minds will come into alignment with this powerful expression of the soul. You will find yourselves seeing the world through different eyes, understanding yourselves and all of God and His Universe with different eyes with the mind of the soul activated by the Love of God and the workings of your being brought into this beautiful alignment that is intended for all humans and spirits.

You will be the forerunners. You will be able to teach and share, to guide and inform those who are eager to step within the flow of the Divine Consciousness and come into alignment with God. This is part of God’s plan, His great and beautiful workings and dealings with humanity and with spirits so that your world and all the worlds will be awakened and brought to higher conditions of Light, of Truth, of Love.

Do you not feel within yourselves a great shift, a difference in your thoughts and motivations? It is not just the present material conditions which impose upon you different ways of doing things in your life. It is more than this, beloved souls. These changing conditions have encouraged and assisted you in opening deeper aspects of your being, soulful knowings and expressions. This will continue to increase and become your prime motivation and so much awaits you. So much will continue to be a part of the unfolding of your life and consciousness in God.

God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you deeply in His Love and Grace and Light. I am with you. Seretta Kem continues to assist you in the unfolding of your beautiful and bright souls. God bless you.
