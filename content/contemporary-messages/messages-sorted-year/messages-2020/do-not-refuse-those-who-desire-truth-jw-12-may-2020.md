I am here Francis - your brother and friend in God’s love 

 My dear brother, my dear sister. When it serves you to remove yourself from the world to be with God I encourage to do so and to find sanctuary and refuge for the sake of your souls. You do not have to become monks and nuns because you are already on this path, and it is so helpful to the world that you are engaged. 
   
For those who open their doors to you and open their hearts we know you will not refuse them because it is your desire to serve, to bring love and truth. But to those who block your pathway who are rigid in their agenda and beliefs and wish to control others, you may leave them behind and wish them well and pray for their souls. They will tarry till they find it and that will be in God’s time. They shall then see the truth and the light and the love and where they stand in relationship to it and to God.
  
So, love all, serve all, and know that you will be protected. We encourage you to stay on this path of love and please know it is our wish for you as we know you will. We love you. 
  
I am your brother and friend in Christ and a disciple of the master 

I am Francis, God bless you.
