I am here, John the Beloved. I am standing over this one. I was drawn to this circle as were many, by the prayer and your discussion. I wish to say that I can feel your curiosity, each one of you, wondering *“What will it be like when I leave this mortal coil, this physical body”* and into the realms of spirit. Of course you are drawn by these various descriptions of those who received guidance from the spirit world and yes, from the Celestial heavens and from the Master himself in some cases. And in this moment you continue to receive this guidance. 

Your curiosity will never end, as progression in the realms of spirit can be endless for those who desire to be completely transformed in the Love of God. When a longing soul goes to God, the intention that is sent, allows God to open the soul and bring His Glorious Love into that soul and it is felt in the heart and sometimes, the entire being is filled with Light. This experience will give you a small, but real idea of what it is like to cross over into the realms of Light. And as you have heard, there are barely words to describe some of the higher spheres and certainly the Celestial Realms and the Kingdom of the Master. What a glorious future awaits, so be not troubled by the things of this earth and the changes, but continue to pray and meditate from the depths of your soul and with all your heart to receive the greatest gift of God’s Love. You will be indeed carried by the celestial angels in Light and Love beyond your imagining, into the true joy and happiness of a transformed and awakened soul. This is your destiny. 

I was one who when on earth, felt deeply in my heart and was drawn to the Master, because of the Great Love flowing from his heart and his hands and his feet, all emanating from his soul. I tell you now, he is a glorious being and we are all blessed to be his friends and disciples, as you are. Go in peace. Be not afraid. May God bless you and watch over you, as we do. I am John, God bless you.
