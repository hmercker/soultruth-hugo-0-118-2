September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Dear souls, you help to bring the light of truth to your world. Through your prayers and efforts, so you open the door that will bring the flood of light, of love, of truth to humanity. Know that each one of your loved ones, the many individuals that are connected to each of you, which if you were to add up all of these peoples, it would be many hundreds who are connected to this group through you. In this way, the influence and the flow of light, goes to them through you, through these interconnected, energetic conditions which are forged as you are bonded with each individual person.

Thus this network of light continues to grow. There are others in the world who add to this network and create a net of light around the world. As you pray, you empower this network. As you pray, you open up the possibilities for the angels to work through you, to assist and inspire others who are in your life and those who are in the lives of those individuals that you are connecting with. So the network grows exponentially. So the truth, the possibility of knowing this truth, is opened to many.

This is a manifestation of God's plan for the salvation of humanity, for this understanding and these gifts of truth are being seeded in many individuals though they may not come to a conscious realisation. In time, they will. As conditions in your world intensify and changes come and transformation becomes more evident, these seeds of inspiration will germinate and come to the consciousness of those individuals who have been blessed.

Yes, there is much you can do in prayer, much you can do as you continue to reach out to one another. With the power of the faith of your soul, you elicit God’s Touch and blessings upon you, building such a light that not only those upon the Earth benefit, but many in spirit do as well as they are drawn to the light. You are each contributing as God’s instruments of light and love to the world.

Have faith in yourselves, beloved souls. Know your true selves, your own soul, and know that the power of your soul may contribute to the awakening and healing of your world. Each of you has great potentials. Each of you are deeply blessed within your soul. Come to realise that it is within this reality of soul that you will find yourselves as God’s instruments and powerfully so as God awakens these great potentials that He has seeded within each one of you.

Have faith in this awakening as you grow and come to know God and feel a powerful bond with your Creator, that this will bring many blessings forth for many of your loved ones and friends and others whom you are associated with. You will see the unfolding of this plan before your eyes and come to acknowledge that this is the workings of God through you. In this have humility, for with humility and grace and faith and love, you will open a clear and powerful channel for God to work through you, around you, into the world.

You are blessed, beloved souls. Come to know how truly blessed you are and how beautiful each of you, each of your souls is for they have been created by God and shall be the manifestations of God's great Hand that comes to save humanity from itself. God bless you, beloved souls God bless you deeply. I am your teacher Augustine and my love for you is great, great indeed. God bless you.
