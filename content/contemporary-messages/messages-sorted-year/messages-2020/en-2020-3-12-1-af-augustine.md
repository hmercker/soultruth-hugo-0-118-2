# The Awakening of the Soul Is Paramount at This Time

March 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Soul Awakening Tour Eastern US, Monroeville, PA, USA

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine. I have come to thank you for your service and your contributions to this time together in prayer. Though there were a number of souls touched by these efforts, these Circles of Light, there were many, many more in spirit who received a deep blessing, encouragement, and Light so they may progress upon the ladder of Light towards at-onement with God. So you’ve served many souls in this time together and you have laid a good foundation.

As you, my son (B), continue to work with the souls who seek the Light, I can assure you that this effort will grow. You will have a great impact upon many as you continue to grow in the Father’s Love, awaken within your soul, and realize the purpose that you have in the world. All is coming and will flow in harmony.

For the dear daughters, you will continue to grow in the Father’s Love and find your place within the flow of service, God's great plan. For I can assure you that you have a place, that your souls sing with the prospect of what is coming in your lives, your purpose, the outpouring of your gifts, the light that you draw to you will continue to grow and brighten with each day.

I wish to assure my charges (J&A) that they will face the conditions that are contrary at this time to their travels. I wish to say that these conditions, what you face today, will be paltry compared to what may come in the future. Yet, you will continue to travel. You will continue to reach out to many. There is much coming in this ministry that God has laid before you my beautiful, beloved souls who serve in love and light. So you charge ahead, spearheading this great effort to bring the Truth of God’s Love to mankind.

Each of you will have your time of teaching and blessing and healing for your brothers and sisters. Each of you will see in your lifetime the unfolding of God’s great plan for the salvation of all.

The awakening of the soul, my beloveds, is paramount at this time. Seeking God in prayer must be a dedication with each day. Seeking to be guided, to be uplifted, to be inspired is a blessing that may come to you, each of you, each day. You must walk in the Light and the Truth of Love with each breath. For the more you can be in alignment with God’s Laws of Love, in alignment with God in deep communion, so the guidance and the blessings that you long for will come to you and so the awakening of your soul will continue to emerge and merge with your conscious self.

In this way, being God’s channels of Love, instruments of change and Truth, will be readily realized in the coming years of service that is laid out for each one of you. I tell you, my beautiful souls, the road is straight. There is no need for diversions. God has plowed this road for you, removing any obstacles in your path, bringing to you many opportunities to serve, bringing to you great openings of Truth, realizations of the great reality of God.

It is time that each of you remove any doubts and barriers for there is no time for such things that may detract from this powerful awakening and flow of Love in your lives. Feel at peace, beloved souls. Know that you have walked the path that God has intended, that you will continue to do so. Though you may have your doubts within your mind, though you may struggle with various challenges of the spirit, know that within your soul all is in harmony with God. It is knowing and being and living within your soul that will release these other conditions that you struggle with and bring a great joy and peace and wisdom, deep, deep wisdom and Love into your lives.

Those challenges of the mind are paltry compared to the great Light of your soul. Accept that you may step into this bright soul awareness and wisdom, that God is guiding you towards this place and it is close. Even for those of you who feel you have just begun the journey, I say to you it is close. To have faith is to say, *“I am willing and I wish to be in greater alignment with You, my beloved Creator.”*

To allow the waves of Love, a surety of faith, a clarity of soul perception, the wonderment and power of His Love glowing within you, to accept these things, to be truly in alignment with these things is not so difficult, my beloved students, not so difficult. It awaits you. God patiently awaits. Your angel friends patiently await. Like the dawning of spring as each beautiful flower emerges and is recognized for all its beauty, so within your soul this spring of Love will bring many flowers and gifts within your soul. Breathe deep. Breathe deep all that God has to give. Know the deep peace that passes all understanding.

May God bless you and keep you my beloved students. Your teacher continues to walk with you, helping and assisting, guiding you forward. With me are many others. You are never alone and often have many who attend to your needs, who uphold you and uplift you in light. Nothing is left to chance, my beloveds. You walk a path designated by God. Feel comforted by this knowledge that you are protected, surrounded, and loved dearly. God bless you. My love is with you.
