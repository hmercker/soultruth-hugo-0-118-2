# Protection is an Actual Blessing

Mahatma Gandhi received by Al Fike

I am Mahatma Gandhi. You wish for some teaching upon the act of protection from God. Indeed, my whole life I prayed for God’s protection for as I walked the Earth, I felt compelled every day to confront darkness, to confront the injustices and inequities wherever I went in the world. I did so in the beginning with indignation and anger but I soon realised that I was joining the forces of darkness with such attitudes. I learned to be calm and to walk in the world with a sense of peace. I gained this peace from God and I brought greater light to myself. Greater wisdom came as I continued in my work to change the world.

This inspiration comes from God and my own soul seeking to do its work on Earth. Work I did with each day. Many came to me for assistance. When I returned to my own country the work was laid out clearly that my own peoples could not choose for themselves their government. It was important that my nation was free from the oppressors. Yet I knew that I could not take up arms and incite others to do so. This was not what I felt in my heart. Instead, I realised that I must live and speak this truth of freedom and inspire others to do so, to be persistent and consistent with the message, to demonstrate freedom, to be a light in the world. In the end, this won over those who would oppress us and won over the world.

Through this journey of awakening and enlightenment, my prayer was always for peace, for goodwill, and that God would protect me in whatever venture I entered into. Protection is an actual blessing. Protection is a light that surrounds and contains God’s instruments. Protection will follow you everywhere provided you are doing God’s work, protection from all the forces of the world, forces that in some cases are very dark indeed. While other forces are a reflection of the human condition in all its variations.

But indeed, it is the human condition, the will of men from which you need to be protected when you wish to do the Will of God. You must align yourselves as clearly and powerfully as you can to be in harmony with God’s Will, to be in harmony with love and all that is of light created by God. This forms the foundation for protection from the darkness. You must be in light always, my friends. Your intentions must be pure, your thoughts high. Your work in alignment with God to walk in that Light that is within the Will and flow of God’s intentions in the world will elicit great protection upon you.

Yet darkness lurks everywhere in your world. In the end, my life was taken somewhat prematurely by dark forces. In my own garden where I invited souls to come to pray with me, to be in harmony together, yet the darkness crept in. So, I fell victim to one man’s anger and desire to change the world and form it in his own image thus causing grief and pain for many. Yet for myself, this violent act actually liberated me from the flesh and brought me into a new world, a beautiful world. I would not wish such an end upon anyone, yet my work had been complete and I was ready to enter into the new world.

You see, life is full of many variations and variables, always changing. The flow of human intention, thought and deed is like the wind. One cannot often predict where it may go, how the world may be expressed with each moment. For the world is subject to the free will of men. Each of you contribute to this. You may create light or you may create darkness. In most cases, you create something in between. It is for you to decide. As I have said, align yourself with light, with God and you can do no wrong when you are truly in alignment with the Divine.

As to your fate, may you live each moment with gusto and deep desire to serve humanity and to be in harmony with God. That way, if you are to transition into spirit, you will have known that you have made your best effort to bring light to the world, to bring light to yourselves, your families, all those around you. If your intentions are indeed powerful in the light, so God will protect you and insure you that do not fall victim to the many pitfalls of your material world.

Unfortunately, there are very few in your world who conduct themselves with such wisdom and intent that they are free from the consequences of negativity and darkness. So much can turn one way or another, depending upon your actions, your efforts, your desires, your thoughts. It is important to understand the power of free will and of course, the power of love. Combined together, they are a powerful force for light in the world.

When one is attuned to God beseeching His Love to infuse you and infuse your world, this elicits a powerful force around you, a light and protection given with the Divine Touch. Allow God to guide you, my friends. Be inspired as I was inspired. Act as I acted upon this inspiration. Be a force for change in the world even if it means at times you might be in jeopardy. But, when you are acting upon the Will of God, you will be protected and given all that you require to be God’s active agent and instrument in the world.

So you must equip yourself, my beloved and beautiful friends, with all the light and love, truth and wisdom that you can gather around you. For in this way you will insure that God’s protection will be your cloak that will insulate you from the dark forces. Walking in faith, walking with love, walking with divine purpose, walking with a desire to serve humanity, these things will insure that with each footfall you will bring light and help to activate change towards light in the world.

Yes, even today, you all remember me and what I did in the world. I was not a saint but a human person who had conviction and also was guided by the Hand of God. That God may not have been the God of your conception, your Christian religion, but it was God nonetheless. I realised that it was and is a God of Love. So I tried to express myself in loving ways and truthful ways, in ways that were informed with integrity and honesty.

A soul is a soul. God is God. It makes no difference with what intellectual understanding you may have of these things. It is the power of your own heart knowing that you are with your Creator working together to bring Love, Light, Truth, equality, equanimity to the world. All the great men of history who are truly remembered for acts of goodness have been guided in this way. For they gather about them the angels of God, the bright spirits of God to help reinforce their intentions and actions to bring change and light to the world.

So you my friends gather about you those who wish to reinforce your intentions, to support you, to act from our side of life as agents to reinforce this work that you do. We will continue to do so, provided you continue to step forward with resolve and strong desire to do the work of God for the benefit of men.

May God bless you in all His Light, protection, Love, upliftment, and soulful awareness so that you may indeed work for the betterment of humanity. Oh yes, the inequities, the dilemmas, and the problems continue to mount, do they not? So much work is needed, so much that is not in harmony with God. So, your work is great and your work requires all the support and love and blessings that can be given. So much needs to be done, so God will utilise you in His plan to change the world and bring it back to balance and harmony. Seek to know your place in what is and will be the great change, a change that will teach men, humble men, and inspire men to truly walk in greater harmony with God.

You are part of this great change, my friends. Walk in faith and be strong. Do not concern yourself that you are in jeopardy for you are not. You are in light and shall do God’s work. His protection is with you. May God bless you upon your journey, upon your mission to bring light to the world. I will be with you. Many, many will be with you. Many who you do not know of or would you recognise, but these angels of God continue to uphold and support you all in your great efforts to bring love to the world, to be God’s instruments and channels of love.

God bless you, my friends. I am Mahatma Gandhi. I continue to work with humanity to help solve these dilemmas of the world. May God bless you with His Love. We are all Love now, are we not? You mortals who understand and we who live in the Celestial Kingdom, we are all agents of Love. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
