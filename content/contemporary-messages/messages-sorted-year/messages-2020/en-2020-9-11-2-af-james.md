James received by Al Fike

May blessings of His Love be upon each one of you, my beloved brothers and sisters. I am James. We are greatly encouraged by your acknowledgement of the power of prayer. For indeed, as one goes to God in prayer, one opens the doors of activation which brings a response from God. You empower God's blessings through your prayers. If the world were to turn to prayer, many of the dreadful conditions that are upon you now and that may come in the future, could be averted for such is the power of prayer. So much more comes with the power of prayer.

As you pray to receive this great gift of Divine Love, so you activate the Laws of Love, the response from the Holy Spirit upon your souls which then awaken your gifts and faculties, transform the condition of your soul into light, into something that has a touch of the Divine within it. So is the power of prayer, to awaken the powers of the universe that God has placed within every corner of His Creation that may be utilised and gifted to each individual soul, that each individual soul may be an active agent of God through prayer, through the desires of your minds and souls to bring harmony and peace to the world.

You are needed. The power and gift of your own prayer to God is needed. The accumulative power of your prayers together is a powerful change agent in the world. So, by the measure of your faith, your prayers go forth to God, the desires of your soul opening and sending forth the deep need and desires of a soul filled with wisdom and light for their brothers and sisters, for themselves, for this world.

You are given many opportunities to pray, and pray you must, for now more than ever, the world needs your prayers. You need your prayers so that you may continue to grow in the Light of God, that you may awaken in the Truth of God, that you may express through all of your being the Love of God infusing every part of you, glowing and igniting your soul so that you may be God's instruments as his channels of love.

Continue to pray, beloved souls. Continue to pray with deep faith, deep desire, and deep yearning for it is these things within you that bring the desired effects of your efforts to pray.

God bless you. I am James, brother of Jesus. I am with you in your prayers as are many, many angels who pray with you at this time. Every time that you pray, we are there to help reinforce and awaken the light that shoots from your soul touching Godâ€™s soul, awakening the response that comes with every sincere prayer to God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. His Love is with you. The love of the angels is with you. You are truly and deeply loved. God bless you. God bless you.
