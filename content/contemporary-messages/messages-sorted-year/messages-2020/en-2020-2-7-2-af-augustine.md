# God Invites You on this Path

February 7<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

It is my prayer that your souls may open to the great inflowing of God’s Love. I am your teacher Augustine. My sincere hope is that all of you may continue to feel that great inflowing, to knowingly receive this Gift, to understand within your hearts how God Loves you so. That you are now truly one of God’s children and cared for in the most wondrous ways, protected, blessed and healed with His Love.

God lays before you a great road, inviting you to step forward upon this path where you will be led and blessed and nurtured by His Great Hand. That your souls will open reflexively and beautifully with this Divine Touch upon you, awakening all the faculties of your soul. Much is waiting for each one of you, beloved souls. Many other souls will be placed upon this path that you will follow. Many experiences with God are close to each one of you as you continue to walk forward, as the scales are peeled from your eyes and the protective barrier around your heart is removed by God’s reassuring Touch, opening to you the wonderment of the Divine. In this way you will share and carry others with you upon this journey of awakening and experience from God to your soul. Much awaits you, my friends. Yes, many are coming.

This dear instrument is delighted by his new-found friends, realizing that there are others of Light who share the desire to be instruments of Light in the world and to bring Truth to the world. There will be many more of their ilk that will come and be a part of this great journey of awakening of humanity to the Truth, to Light, to conditions, understandings, expressions, and commitment to Light. For, these are the future leaders of a world that is emerging, that is of Light and will indeed change the conditions that humanity experiences. The standards and beliefs and cultures and ideas that humanity has long nurtured will fall away and will evolve into something new, something beautiful. Humanity is on the verge of new-found Truth, of greater Light, of closer harmony with God’s Creation. Though to you, at this time, this seems unlikely as you observe the many darkened conditions in your world, but I say, before the dawn is the night. In this nightfall of humanity there is an impetus, a deep desire and yearning within the souls of humanity to awaken to Light and God’s great and beautiful blessing of Light will indeed dawn upon you all. You beloved and beautiful souls, who continue to strive towards the Light, will be utilised as God’s instruments to help point the way, to help ring that clarion bell that says a new dawn is coming and that new Light is being shed upon your world.

Beloved souls, how precious you are to us who are nurturing and embracing you. How precious you are to God who loves you so. How important it is that you continue upon this journey, walking upon this road of Light so that others may follow, so that you may shed the truth of understanding, the wisdom of the knowing soul for those who are eager to understand and know, those who are afraid and confused and yet, within their souls there is a semblance of understanding that what changes may come are necessary for the new awakening of humanity.

So much is upon the horizon, beloved souls. So much that cannot yet be shared, but I am sure and I know that you all feel with anticipation, with a sense of excitement and desire, what is on the horizon; how close we are all to the awakening of humanity to Light. God’s great plan for the salvation of all in the world is upon us and continues to work its subtle yet powerful blessings upon your world. It brings changes within the hearts of all so that they may be open and receptive, that they too may feel the joy of the anticipated awakening of the soul. This is coming, beloved souls. It is upon you all, it will come consciously to all humanity who are willing to be open and receptive to God’s Great Touch and desire that they may know the Truth, that they may know His Great Soul, that they may be awakened to all the possibilities that God’s Creation.

May God bless you upon that journey. Your teacher Augustine, along with many in the world of spirit, in the Celestial Kingdom, are with you and eagerly work with you to express and bring to fruition the Will of God for your world and that love may reign supreme in every heart, every soul upon your world. May God bless you, beloveds. I am your teacher Augustine. My love, my joy, my anticipation continues to grow as I see you all awakening in Light. God bless you. God bless you all.
