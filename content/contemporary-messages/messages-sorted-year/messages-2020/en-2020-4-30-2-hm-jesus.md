# Drop by Drop

April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Mediumship Workshops, Swakopmund, Namibia

Jesus received by Helge Mercker

I am Jesus. I come to greet you in this morning hour as you pray for our Father’s Love. I come to you my sister, child of God, and bring the blessings of my love to you.

It is in these blessings of the Father’s Love, that the soul opens up and one is able to feel the whispers that are coming into the soul, being recognized by the soul and in time rising to the consciousness of your material mind. In these blessings many things are happening within your being, most of all, the soul is stirred. Joyfully the soul opens, ever ready to receive the Gift it longs for. It can increase to a mighty pouring into one’s soul, all dependent on the desires of the child to be close to God. Many seek this pouring of love into their souls and get disillusioned when they don’t feel the immediate effects or outcomes.

As we know, the soul is very subtle in its workings and effects. The more developed and progressed the soul is, the greater the realizations on a conscious level. The interpretation, if I may use the word, fluctuates in accordance to the linkage of soul mind with its material counterpart. Thus, we ask for the harmonization of these two parts of you, so the expressions coming from the depths of your soul are communicated via your material being more readily and expressively.

The merging of soul mind with the material mind is a process that requires dedication to bring about the transformative action of the substance of the Father’s Love. And you see how the drop of colour changes in water, initially swirling in strong colours, then dissolving throughout the water, and slowly over time colouring the water. So, it is with the soul. The strong flow of God’s Love entering the soul will slowly be absorbed within the soul. With each drop of Love entering the soul, it will have a “colouring” effect, and with each prayer, each soulful longing for the Father’s Love, there will come a response. Drop by drop It fills the soul, subtly changing and transforming the very structure and being of soul into the substance of divinity.

May God bless you dear daughter and continue to hold you close, in His arms of Love. I am Jesus, the Master of the Celestial Heavens and I bring my blessings of love, and my light. God bless you, my love is with you and I come again. God bless you. Jesus loves you, as I love all my brothers and sisters. God bless you all.
