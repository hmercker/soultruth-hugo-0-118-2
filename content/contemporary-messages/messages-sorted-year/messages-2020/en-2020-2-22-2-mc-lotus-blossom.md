February 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2020

Mediumship Workshops, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

You draw me near and many of you know me, I am Lotus Blossom. What a blessing it is for each of you to be gathered here in a Circle of Light, whose souls open up to the Beloved Creator’s inflowing of Love. You desire to come to know your guides from side of spirit who walk with you, who teach you, who comfort and love you. Always know that we come to you by the gift of God’s direction for we are servants of God. So the encouragement is to long for God’s Love and address everything to God. Have God direct through His Will those beautiful guides to come close to you and help you upon your journey.

Some of you have come to know your particular guide or guides and a rapport has developed. This is a beautiful relationship coming to know your dear friends in spirit but it is always through the gift of knowing your Heavenly Creator that the blessings will come. Yes, my gift of healing I share with the beloved souls of Earth. It is an important part of my soul’s service to bring healing and comfort to many and also to work, to teach, and to guide many healers on Earth with this gift. We work together in sleep state for your soul travels into spirit while your physical body rests and rejuvenates. As you are in spirit, your soul learns much through your guides and your band of angels that resonate with your gifts, whom God has directed.

There are times when you are in your wakeful state that your conscious mind will recall something from your soul that you have learned. Then you can consciously implement this teaching.  As you continue to walk your path here on Earth, be sure to keep your thoughts high and your desires to serve and for your light to grow as this attracts the high teachers to you who will help you and direct you upon your path. It is an evolving process and as your soul continues to grow and expand in Love and in Light, your guides and teachers will also change. Though some will remain with you for your entire life, there are certain guides and teachers that will come to you as you continue to progress and share their love and guidance and gifts with you.

Those of you who are healers in this group, should you desire to awaken your soul by the Grace of God’s Love, I may come and work with you also. God may direct me to come and help to influence and teach you and share with you my particular gifts of healing. But each of you may call upon me for healing directly upon you and I will come and share my gift with you for I know your physical bodies and your minds are often in pain. These discomforts of the body distract you. So you are welcome to call upon me, beloveds, but always insure that your prayers are to God, that your soulful longing is to God and the highest shall be in your presence.

I thank you for hearing my words and for hearing the call of your soul to come together in this way and be in the Presence of God’s great Love. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Lotus Blossom and my love is with you. God bless you.
