Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

Professor Salyards here. You will be exploring new paradigms of thought and approach. You will be guided as to how to implement these new ideas, creative thoughts and expressions. It will come to you in many ways. At times it will be in a dream, at times it will be in prayer, at times it will be in your conversations with one another. We will work with you and bring inspiration in these many ways and facets of your life and your life's expression. Expect the unexpected, expect to be surprised, to be awakened to new ideas, to be inspired, to act in new ways that are unusual for you in your life. It is innovation that will bring about the new understandings and dialogues and teachings of a new world that is about to emerge.

Within each one of you are great capacities to receive, absorb, integrate, and express many new things. The power of the love within your soul will break loose those barriers and time-worn but not necessary approaches and ideas of the mind so well cultivated over the years of your lives. Be joyful in anticipation of what is coming and know that you are indeed being guided, that we are working upon each one of you constantly helping to release that which is not required and necessary and at times in error and to adopt and absorb that which is new and beautiful and in greater alignment with God. So much is coming, my beloved and dear friends, a whole wave will envelop you, a wave of joy, of insight, of revelation. This will carry you forward, all of you, into this new paradigm of thought and action in service to God in the flow of His Love for humanity. You will find your place to serve, to bring truth, to awaken and enlighten many souls.

Together we work for the benefit of humanity. May God bless you and bless us in these efforts. Blessings to you, beloved friends, love to you all and all who wish to come into this wondrous venture, this loving expression to help humanity awaken and find their true selves in joy, in love, in light and in truth. God bless you. Your Professor Salyards continues to work with you and be with you. God bless you.
