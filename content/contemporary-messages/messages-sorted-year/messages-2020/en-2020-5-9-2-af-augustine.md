Augustine received by Al Fike

I want to commend each of you for your efforts and your desire to continue upon this Path Divine to awaken to all the potentials of your souls. My beautiful brothers, keep in mind that your minds, your material minds, are intent on exploring the potentials of your psychic gifts. Your curiosities in these regards continue to motivate you to experiment and to be aware of these experiences.

On the other hand, your souls are intent on being with God. It is important that you recognise this desire within your souls and put this as your primary focus. When this focus is clear and directed towards God in prayer then these gifts, not only of the mind and the psychic abilities but of the soul, will emerge and come together in harmony. It is a matter of priority. It is a matter of where you direct your thoughts and focus.

Provided the foundation of Divine Love, receiving this gift of God’s Love,  making this your primary focus in prayer, so that all else will follow in its good time and place. God wishes for you to utilise all your gifts, beloved souls. God wants to utilise your gifts for the benefit of others. God wants you to understand through the many faculties that He has blessed you with to come to know all the wonders and aspects of His Universe.

But first must be first. Your priorities and desires to grow your soul will accomplish all the manifestations and openings and developments of your gifts in harmony with His Will and with the complexities of your own being coming into concert with one another in a harmonious, beautiful way. This orchestra that is all that is within you will play a beautiful tune, something that is glorious, something that may benefit so many, something that will leave a mark in the world while you are within it.

Beloved souls, there is a plan for each one of you. There are attending angels that will assist you in all of these unfoldings and expressions. Allow God to be within your consciousness. Allow the power of His Love to be the motivating factor in all that you do. Ask to be guided. Ask to be blessed. Ask to be used as an instrument to serve God for the benefit of all your brothers and sisters. Ask to be protected. Ask to be used for the highest good and purpose. Ask to be in God’s Grace. In these ways and desires and blessings from God, so you will find your way. You will be astonished as to what may manifest and come forward in your lifetime.

May God bless you upon that journey, my beloved friends. We are so very pleased that you are making these efforts, that you are sharing your experiences and thoughts and longings of the soul. You become bonded in this sharing, in this time you dedicate to one another and to development and opening of your gifts of soul.

God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you indeed upon this wondrous path that will bring forth many, many wondrous gifts and blessings. God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine. I am glad to be of assistance to you all and I am with you all on many occasions. God bless you. My love is with you.
