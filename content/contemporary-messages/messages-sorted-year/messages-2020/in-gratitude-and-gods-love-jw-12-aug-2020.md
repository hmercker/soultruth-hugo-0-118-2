# In Gratitude and God’s Love

August 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your brother and friend in Christ, George Vale Owen - Reverend Owen. I am so grateful for my journey and blessings I received as I do reside in what you call the 7th Sphere,<sup>1</sup> the gateway to the Celestial Realms where there is love and beauty and music beyond even what I received and was described by me in my writings. And yet even then I could see the glory, I could feel the Love. For my soul to be at one in Christ in the Love of God was always my deepest desire.

To be with you and to hear you recite the messages I received is a joy for me and I hope they bring you much wisdom and glimpses, however big or small, of what is to come so that you are enticed to pray and to receive the Love of your Creator. I wish to thank the dear brother in Australia for [bringing out of obscurity the messages](https://new-birth.net/other-stuff/books-we-love/books-on-life-after-death/#lowlands) I received and the writings in the books which were once widely read and now again I hope they shall be, along with the beautiful Celestial messages received by James Padgett and others - your contemporaries in the world today.<sup>2</sup> 

Each one resonates with those souls diverse as they may be, in exactly the way that opens them, awakens their soul, inspires them to be in prayer, to receive and to be uplifted on this journey in God’s Love and Grace. Once felt there will be no turning back though one may meander for a time, though one may doubt, though one may speculate on one's worthiness, I tell you once you ask for this Love and receive it and feel the joy, you can never truly go back as you now are on the path, a glorious path of God’s Love. 

I am grateful to you all for coming together in this study and in your prayers. You draw so many beautiful angels and bright spirits and even those troubled ones in-between progressing through the spheres beyond what you can see know that as God lifts you up you lift up others. How beautiful is that? 

My dear friends, my brothers and sisters in Christ. May all be blessed. I am Reverend Owen your brother in Christ. God bless you.

**Note 1** In the numbering system used in Rev George Vale Owen's books this would be the 14th sphere. 

**Note 2** I (Geoff Cutler) consider these the very finest of channeled material other than the Padgett Messages and the contemporary messages such as received from Judas and more recently on the Soul and held on this web site. But if your interest is in what happens in the heavens these five volumes are certainly the gold standard.
