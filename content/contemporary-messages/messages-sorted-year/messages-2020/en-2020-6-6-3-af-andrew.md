Andrew received by Al Fike

…His Love touch you deeply, beloved souls, I am Andrew. Yes, the world is awakening from its slumbers and you have nothing to fear, beloved souls, provided you are willing and able to attune yourselves to Light, to be in the Grace of God, to be that beautiful soul that you are meant to be. This is your protection from those changes in the world that are continuing to unfold. Only those who are willing to continue to sleep and abandon their own selves to the distractions of this world, who will suffer from continuing upheavals and changes. Those who have undergone the challenges of the past while and have felt a sense of peace, truly know that within them is an understanding that the world, God’s world, the world of God's Creation will embrace all who are willing to be embraced.

So I urge you, beloved souls, to pray. Pray for this world, pray for all within it. For the time comes for all to awaken, to allow the Truth of their souls to emerge, come forward within their conscious self and to seek alignment with Light, with Love, with Truth. You cannot fight or battle these changes with the might of the human condition and all that comes with it. No, this will not bring resolution. It is the capitulation of what you call ego, or the willful desire to exert your power in the world, so that you might come into greater alignment with God and have and express a deep sense of humility. In this way, this simple way, you will gain the world and you will gain what you require to overcome the barriers that will keep you from peace and joy and enlightenment. Seek from within, that yearning of the soul, and express that yearning to God, and there will be a response, always. And you will find your way along what must and will be, a somewhat circuitous path towards peace and harmony. God has much in store for each one, that is a blessing and a healing and Truth.

May you find a way to open yourselves to what is meant to be given to each one of you. God has a plan and this plan is unfolding as we speak, will continue to do so for many years to come. May you come to know this plan and be in harmony with this plan. May you come to accept this plan and see its wisdom and power to heal and bring the world into harmony.

May God bless you, beloved souls, I am Andrew. My love is with you all. Many angels seek to assist you all in these times of challenge and wakefulness. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you with His Love. Thank you. My love is with you.
