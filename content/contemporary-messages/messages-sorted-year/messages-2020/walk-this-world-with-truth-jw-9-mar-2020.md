# Walk this world with the Truth

March 9<sup>th</sup>, 2020

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am Care. Yes, it was John who came. He was attracted as were many here. Each one of you with your gifts and the knowing that the time has come to rely on God and the Celestial angels and walk into the world with the truth and the Presence of God’s Love.

The community is expanding in Divine Love exponentially around the world and so each of you, as well as many others have their part to play, should you choose to do so. For me, I wished nothing other than to serve when on earth and even more so now as an inhabitant of the Celestial heavens, to work with you all. I feel your intentions and also your reluctance, but you are worthy and you are qualified and you are gifted and above all, you are blessed. 

So, we here, we are on this walk with you, we’re on this path, where we are all dependent on God. This you know. I was filled with joy at your gathering in this circle and I embrace you all with my love and with the Love of God. 

I thank my beloved Jimbeau for taking this message. Rise and shine and give God your Glory! I love you. I am Care.
