Received by Al Fike

 

A day to stretch your souls and be with God. A day to release whatever may burden you. A day to be alive like a child, stretching yourselves, being awake and joyful in life. Seek God in all that you do, my beloveds. Keep Him close to you and all that you aspire towards, all that carries you forward. All hope and desire to serve in love will come with this dawning day, this pure and beautiful desire to be with God in His Love. Deep blessings to you, beloved souls and deep blessings to all who seek God for their nourishment, who seek to walk in light. May you continue upon this journey, beloveds, and know that God’s Hand is upon you. You are truly loved. You are carried and anointed and God continues to pour His blessings upon you. Breathe in the light. Beloveds, you are blessed. 

I am Jesus and I am with you. God bless you.
