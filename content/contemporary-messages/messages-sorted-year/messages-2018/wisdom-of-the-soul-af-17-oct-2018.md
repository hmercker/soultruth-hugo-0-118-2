I am Solomon of old and I’ve come a long way to be with you today. I have been praying for you my friends, one of many, many who have kept you within our consciousness and embrace you with our love and our good will towards your efforts to bring the Truth of God’s Love to mankind, to help ignite the changes that God wills to come to your world. 

You must be strong my friends. You must be strong within your minds and souls. See that nothing shakes you from your understanding and your desire to be in close alignment with God, to be strong in the blessings of His Love, to keep firmly within your minds and your souls the acknowledgement of this simple Truth that changes all in its path, brings resolution to all things, brings harmony to all things, brings connection, deep and powerful, between your soul and God’s Soul. 

My beloved friends, realize that within your grasp is the highest Truth of all, the most powerful blessings of all. You must sustain this knowledge and awareness and light within you, so that it may be expressed in the world in powerful but simple ways, in beautiful examples of love and truth. You must sustain this, beloved souls, and forever reach higher with greater desire and intense longings. For it is with the strength that you build within your souls, the clarity that you sustain within your minds, the beauty of your efforts in service to God, the willingness to follow God’s Will that carries you forward my beautiful friends. Wisdom comes from this simple way, deep wisdom, wisdom that shall bring forth clear solutions to the dilemmas of mankind. For as your souls are activated, so this wisdom becomes clear and evident in everything that you do and think and express in this world. Wisdom will be a part of who you are in such depth and clarity, that many will seek your counsel beloveds, many will follow your words and your deeds, your light and your love. The laws pertain to this beloved souls. As your light grows, so you draw those who are hungering, those who are in need of your wisdom and love and light. Beloved souls, continue to strengthen yourself, to be in this state of receptivity, of harmony, of balance and of joy. 

You live within the embrace of God. You feel the power and beauty of this embrace. Your souls begin to awaken to this reality, the reality of God. Bring yourselves ever closer beloved souls to this reality, this clear and glorious knowing and acknowledgment of God. In this you will find your salvation, beloved souls. In this you will find the answers to that which you seek. In this you will find the ways in which you may serve and express your gifts in the world. In this your desires for gifts, powerful and unusual, to manifest and become known to others. So much comes from God, so much comes from your efforts to be in harmony and alignment with God. Seek for the highest, beloveds. Be strong, be clear and may the wisdom of your souls inform your actions and thoughts and deeds beloveds, beloved, beautiful souls. I am with you in your efforts. Many, many angels continue to serve your efforts on earth and to bring about greater light to your world. 

God bless you, I am Solomon. My prayers, my love, my desire for your success is with you beloved souls. God bless you.
