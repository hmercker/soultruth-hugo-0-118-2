May our Heavenly Father’s touch of His Love conveyed by the Holy Spirit flow into your souls in great abundance my beloveds. I come, I am Jesus.

And I come to assure you that God is close to each one of you in your lives. He touches your soul and you have a powerful bond with your Heavenly Father and nothing can break this bond my beloveds. You are claimed by God in Holy Communion, in light and Love everlasting is your gift and your promise from your Creator who carries you upon this world in arms of Love, who walks with you as you continue to grow in your souls, as you continue to express yourselves in light. As you walk along the perilous path of life you are upheld and carried and you feel the touch of God within you, His Love sustaining you, warming your hearts, bringing peace and surety to your lives.
God is with you my beloveds. God will never leave. And I am with you my beloveds, nor will I leave but continue to walk with you in this world. For you are my brethren and our bond shall never break but only increase with your prayers and your efforts to come close to our Heavenly Father.

Blessed are the peacemakers, those agents of change, those awakened souls who wish to bring light to this world and greater harmony to humanity. Blessed are you my beloveds for you make every effort to make your life a life filled with love and light, harmony and peace. And this shall continue and increase as you grow in the Father’s Love and come to know with the eyes of your souls your Heavenly Father, the God that has created you and loves you.

Continue to be strong in your faith my beloveds, to walk with considered steps upon your road with faith and joy, wisdom and peace and all else shall follow and fall into place as God expresses His Plan for the salvation of mankind through you my beloveds and you shall join all of His beautiful children who are at this time and will continue in times to come to bring the changes that are necessary, to bring healing and balance to your world, to bring love and light.

Your opportunities to serve will increase. The souls who are meant to join with you in this service shall come, one by one, day by day. Your numbers will increase. Your efforts will expand, and your work shall deepen in love.

Such are the many gifts from your Heavenly Father who knows you better than you know yourselves. Whose Love is greater than you can possibly imagine. His care for you is intricate and beautiful in its expression. You are upheld by God beloved souls and you shall continue to walk in His Light, guided by His Will, carried by His Love.

God bless you my beloveds and my love is with you in all that you do, and every moment know that my love is with you. God bless you. God bless you my beloved, beautiful friends.
