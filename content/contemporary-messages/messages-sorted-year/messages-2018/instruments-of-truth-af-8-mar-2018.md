Â 

There is a great deal of knowledge in this room. Many of you are well aware of the healing modalities that God has gifted mankind with. You must share these truths with others, educate the souls as to how to increase their wellbeing, the vitality of their spirit bodies and their flesh bodies. And you must add to this the Truth of God's Love, for does not God's Love expand and accentuate all truth and all blessings?

There is a great hunger in the world, my friends, a great curiosity and need for truth. You beloved souls, you carry a great Truth and you carry many truths. God will place you upon the path where you may share your wisdom and your knowledge with those who are willing to listen and who thirst within their souls. Work together, beloved souls, work to uplift mankind for there is a great need.

As you come to know the Will of God, God will guide you and use you as His Instruments of Truth. Much more awaits you, my beloveds, in your understanding and knowledge, your perception of Truth. As you grow in this Love, you make more room for truth, you have a greater capacity to absorb the wonders of God's Creation. You will find your way, you will be used in many ways to help bring greater Light to this world, to help usher in the changes that are needed to bring this world back to harmony and Light.

Every day brings greater opportunity, a lesson, some insight, some revelation and perception that is gifted to you from God. Open your eyes, beloveds, open your hearts and your souls and your minds to the great bounty, this banquet of Truth that awaits you. God gifts you with everything that you need, everything that you desire that is in harmony with His Love and every gift, so that you may serve God with greater capacity and power to bring Light.
The enlightenment of your souls comes with the awakening through Love. One is always with the other together, Love and Truth, Love and Truth. It will be recognized by your soul and utilized by your mind. This is coming. You already have much to share. You will share in many different ways in this world.

Blessings to you, my beloved friends. May God keep you always in His Light and care. I am Lotus Blossom and I love you. God bless you. God bless you.
