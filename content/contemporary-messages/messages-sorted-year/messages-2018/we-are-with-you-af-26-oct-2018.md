I am Martha. You know when we see the conditions of the world and the conditions of the souls who inhabit this world, it is daunting for us to attempt to bring a soul up beyond these conditions. It is not an easy task and requires our efforts, but mostly it requires God’s Touch to bring about this transformation of the soul. With His Love, all is possible, otherwise those who walk the path of the natural love have a great and difficult journey to climb beyond these conditions. So we seek those souls who are open to the way of love, who are willing to invest their time and effort, to see life from a different perspective and to walk in this world in love. 

You, my beloveds, are those souls that we seek, that we have put our efforts towards, and worked in conjunction with God’s guidance and Touch upon your souls. You must seek out all those souls in the world who are willing as you have been willing to open themselves to this powerful Touch of Love so the change will come to them and to many. You have opened the door for this work and we are so joyful in your commitment, your efforts, that you have struggled and overcome so much and that you continue to trust in the power of love, God’s Love, and that you are brave and willing and strong enough to forge the path less travelled, to be the kindred souls and children of God. 

We will continue to serve you, beloveds and carry you forth in the world for we are all guided by God. We all listen and obey the Will of God. For it is His Will and plan and way that is of the highest and brings the greatest blessings to all. God wishes to heal your world and God wishes to heal every soul upon your world. God wishes for your world to be in harmony and peace, that love may prevail, that darkness may be dispersed and light put in its place. Those who are willing to work on behalf of God’s plan for the salvation of mankind and the healing of this world will be always uplifted, supported and gifted with what is required to do this work. You already see how powerful is God’s Touch and His guidance in your life, how he has provided for you many things and many opportunities and this will continue, beloved souls. It is only for you to accept these gifts, to walk in love, to trust in the will of God and all else shall indeed fall into place. 

My friends, beloved souls who carry on, who have allowed the chain to be unbroken, the chain of truth, my gratitude and love for you all is so overpowering in my heart. To see such beautiful lights. I know that you, each of you, did not start your life in this way, that you have struggled and you have been violated as all souls of this world have struggled and been violated and yet you have overcome and you are strong and beautiful and willing to bring greater love to this world and into your own heart. 

This brings great joy to us all, great hope for humanity that this resilience of the soul continues to shine forth against such dark conditions. Beloved, beloved friends, I wish you could know how deeply you are loved and appreciated and acknowledged. Every angel in heaven knows of you, my beloveds. They continue to pray for you, that you may indeed overcome all obstacles that are on your path, all pain and hurts that are in your soul, all obstructions that distract you from love. We are with you. We will continue to strive to support you upon this journey of the awakening of your souls and the great service that God has opened for each one of you as grow in love.

Beloved, beloved friends, Martha loves you, loves you dearly. I will continue in my commitment to support you and to be with you, to pray for you, to minister to you. I love you. I love you from the depths of my soul. I love you. God bless you.
