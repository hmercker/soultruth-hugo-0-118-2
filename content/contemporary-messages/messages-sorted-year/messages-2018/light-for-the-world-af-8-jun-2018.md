Light my beloveds, Light for the world, Light for your souls. When you come together in prayer, you are drawing Light to your world. When you aspire to bring Light within your souls, you become a Light in the world and the world needs more Light, does it not? All the conditions of your world, all the pain, darkness, the struggles that humanity must endure because so many have lost their way, so many do not understand that Love is the currency of mankind. Without Love, there is no true life. For the world that God has created is infused with Love and so few in your world have come to recognize this, to see the power of Love, the beauty of Love. Love does transform. Love does bring harmony. Love does bring Light. When you seek the highest Love of all, the Love that God has for each one of you and can be conveyed within your souls, you seek for the brightest Light. The most powerful source for good in the universe is this blessed gift of God’s Love. 

Be a Light in the world, beloved souls. Seek to be a channel of Love in the world. A beacon of Light, for not only will your souls benefit from this effort and desire and prayer, but so will the world. Do you not think that this is the highest calling of all at this time in your world, to help to disburse the darkness, to be a channel of Love, to allow God to bring His Love through you, to be guided and touched by God’s Soul bringing to you wisdom and peace? Bringing forth and alive your gifts, all the treasures laid up in your souls that are awaiting the power and blessing of God’s Love to awaken them, to bring them to the fore so that you may indeed help assist many who are lost and hungering for Love, hungering for Truth.

It starts with a simple prayer my beloveds, a simple longing, a desire to be above the darkened conditions of your world to a place of grace and Light. It leads to many, many possibilities and opportunities to be of service to the world. Each of you has a longing to be of service, to bring greater Truth and Light forth in the world. Every soul that longs for this and expresses their longings to God, will find answers to their prayers, will be placed before them many opportunities to serve, many gifts to express, many souls upon your path that you may indeed touch with Love and Light. Firstly you must be strong, you must be consistent in your efforts to be with God. When your life is focused in this way, a torrent of Light and blessings, gifts and possibilities will flood into your lives, beloved souls. These are the Laws in action - the Law of Activation, the Law of Love, the Law of Attraction and the Law of Light. Beloved souls seek for the highest and most blessed of gifts and you shall be richly rewarded. Your souls shall find what it is that it longs for. It longs to be close to God, to be with its Source and Creator, to know the Love that emanates from God.

This simple Truth has within it enough power to change the world my beloveds, for if you were to open the eyes of all your brothers and sisters to the power of Love, the darkness would disperse, the pain would be no more. All those conditions that humanity has created by lack of Love would be rectified and in time all would come into harmony. So few recognize this my beloved, although in their souls and hearts there is a kernel of recognition, a part of them that knows but is not strong enough to move beyond their own human condition to a place of greater awareness and Truth. It is for the strong in this world, those who truly seek more Light, those who wish to place Love as their focus and purpose in life who will truly step forth and make the changes that are necessary to bring Light in this world for they will have found the source of all Light and utilize this Truth, the gift of God’s Love to bring about many changes, blessings, gifts of service and Love to all. God awaits those who seek to serve in this way and seek to know and recognize the Truth within their hearts and desires to receive more of this bounty of Light and Love, to carry it within, to express it in every aspect of their life and within. God beseeches you to come close, to seek that which He wishes to give and give in great abundance. Be the receiver, open yourselves in humility, simplicity and faith. You shall receive more than you can imagine, such a bounty as is unfathomable, yet is given to each soul who seeks to know and be and recognize this Truth. 

I am Keea Atta Kem. May God bless you abundantly, beautiful souls. May you continue to seek and be in alignment with the highest and greatest of Light. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
