I am Mark and I know there are those here who wish guidance regarding your church. I say to you, God’s Hands rest upon your church. It is safe and it has the protection of God’s care and keeping. You who are entrusted with the care of this church will be guided and continue to be guided. This church, this little place, this sanctuary of Light has a deep purpose to fulfill and the Will of God will surely be enacted. Those who are meant to come will be guided. Those who step through the threshold will be blessed. The Light within your church, our church, continues to be bright and will be sustained. Do not worry or fret. Though the conditions of the outside world may impinge upon your beautiful sanctuary at times, do not allow these conditions to govern the direction of your church. Go to a higher source, my beloveds. Go to the Source for your guidance, to know the purpose and direction which God intends with this place. 

There is a plan. Opportunities are opening. The Light continues to shine and peace is predominant within the halls of this sanctuary. May peace be predominant within you, my beloveds, and those of you who step into roles of service and support. Place your prayers upon the blessings of God. Allow His Grace to uplift and heal, protect and guide, and all will be well my beloveds. All will be well. Has this church not survived many, many years? Indeed the power of the Light in this sanctuary sustains it and ensures its survival. Though many have come and gone, many have sought refuge and Light, still it is sustained. Its purpose continues to be expressed in Light. 

May God bless all those who enter your church. May God bless all those who work for Light and harmony, peace and healing. That these things may come to all of you as you continue to pray and participate in your gatherings under this roof. You shall be blessed. All shall be blessed. 

God bless you, I am Mark. I continue to watch over this blessed place, which I too love, and am grateful for the opportunity to be of service in this way. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
