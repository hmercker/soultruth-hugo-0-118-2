# Divine Love is the Key to Eternal Transformation

November 8<sup>th</sup>, 2018

First United Spiritualist Church, Burnaby, B.C. Canada

Received by Maureen Cardoso

 

Beloved souls, I am Mark.  I am the guardian of this beautiful Church, this Sanctuary of Light.  When you yearn and long from your heart and yearn to your beloved Creator, longing for the Essence of this Love, this highest gift comes upon you and flows into your souls, thus you begin a transformation of your soul, one from its natural state of being, moving toward the potential of a divine being.  For the gift of this Love, the Love of the Creator, the Divine Love is one that will transform your soul allowing your gifts - the highest potential of your gifts - to open in harmony, to come to fruition in your soul so there is an alignment within your body and within your mind towards the Essence of Love.  

Beloved souls, as you gather here this evening in prayer, you are either beginning your journey of this transformation for those who are new to this practise, or you are adding to this transformation which is an eternal process.  The Divine Love received within your soul is limitless, the expansion is eternal, the transformation is eternal.  And one who discovers this very Truth while on earth is a very blessed soul indeed for it is much easier to begin this connection with your beloved Creator on earth than it is when passing into spirit. 
 
The teachings of Divine Love are for the soul and when this soul has received enough of this Love many of your conditions that are not in harmony with the laws of creation begin to fall away from you and your thoughts and your words and your actions become more in alignment with Love.  This my friends, is a practise worth making an effort for and each time that you make your sincere efforts from your heart, from your soul, to reach to your beloved Creator there will be a response. This Love is available at all times, for it is only for your asking.  This can be done at any moment at any time, always available to you.  So my friends, as you sit in a circle here this evening, I wish to encourage you to make this part of your day, coming to know your beloved Creator, understanding your true selves, allowing the blessing of your soul’s purpose to make its mark here on earth.  

When you feel aligned with your purpose, your life has a great sense of ease and flow about it. The alignment is true, for it is what you are here to do, each and everyone’s purpose is to be a gift of love to themselves and to others. But beloveds, the Divine Love is the fuel that your soul requires to ignite this ember, to grow the flames of love within you. So when you feel challenged by the many conditions that are on Earth, turn to this prayer practise, turn to your Creator and allow this nurturing Essence to bless you always. For it is your effort and your will that will transform your soul, as God is always waiting to bestow this perfect gift upon you, and as you pray for this Love know that us in the Celestial Realms who have been transformed by this Love are there to serve you and will be close to you. You are welcome to notice and feel our presence as we always like for you to know when we are near you, uplifting you, inspiring you and encouraging you. We bring our love to you as close as can be, but it does require your reaching out. Always reach to God and we are a gift that God sends to be of help to you.  It is our joy to serve mankind. Be in prayer often, beloveds, our love is always with you.  

God bless each of you, my love is with you. I am Mark and I thank you for hearing my words this evening. God bless you.
