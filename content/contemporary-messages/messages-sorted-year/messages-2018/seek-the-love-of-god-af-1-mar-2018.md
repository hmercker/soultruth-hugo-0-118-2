May God Touch each of your souls with His Love. May that Touch go deep within you and bring to you an awakening and an understanding of the blessings that God has to bring to each one of you, beloved souls.  It is not difficult to see and to recognize, it is merely a desire away, a desire away, a prayer, a longing from within you. Yet with this longing and prayer, this gift is available and may be given upon the request from that soul to receive its Touch from God within the soul.

God’s Love is available to you at this moment.  Open yourselves, beloved souls.  Allow this gift to pour into you, allow your souls to absorb, eagerly drinking of these Living Waters and therefore beginning a journey that will never end.  For in this gift comes the potential to be at-one with God, and in this oneness there is infinite Love and a journey that will never end.

So I urge you my beloved souls, seek this gift.  Pray for this gift.  Sit in silence and longing, with openness and desire.  Allow what God has to give you to manifest in a conscious way within and you will come to know your own souls with such clarity and beauty, such power and joyful recognition that it will change your life, beloved souls.  It will change your life.  For when one comes to know this place within these deep chambers of the soul and when these chambers are filled with the blessings from God and the awareness blossoms forth and you come to recognize your relationship with the Source of All, it colours and changes your perceptions, your awareness of the world, of yourselves and of the purpose of your life.  Many deep changes and awarenesses come with the awakening of your soul and each of you in some way have a desire for this.  You thirst for Truth.  You thirst for Love.  You thirst for Peace.  You thirst for awakening and this great blessing, this substance that comes from God and is carried by the Holy Spirit will satisfy this yearning and it will quench your thirsts, beloved souls.

So now you are issued an invitation to seek this highest of gifts, this greatest of blessings.  May you reach out and allow this to touch you deeply, powerfully, beautifully.  Blessed are those who seek the Light, blessed are the peacemakers, blessed are those who are humble and come to God to receive the blessings that are available to each and every soul.  You are blessed my beloveds.  May you continue to be blessed and the Light that builds within you may grow to a mighty flame, a powerful beacon in this darkened world.  There is much for you to know and to experience, to grow and to awaken.  Put your feet upon this path and you will find many, many blessings will come upon this journey.  Seek the Love of God and all will come in its stead, beloved souls.  I am Matthew and my love is with you.  God bless you.  God bless you beloveds.
