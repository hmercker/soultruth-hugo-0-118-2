I am Jesus. You have known my presence often as you pray. I have come very often to be with you in your prayers because I take a deep interest in the work that you do and your deep desires to walk in truth and love in your world. Because you are my disciples, you bring this truth that I brought, you do this work that I did and you follow the path that I followed. In this commitment to the Truth of God’s Love, know that I will always be with you. I will always carry the lantern in front to light your way, to usher you along your path, to be your brother and your friend in this glorious journey. 

I know you all, beloveds, so very well and you have come to know me. This shall only deepen in our relationship and work together, to bring the Truth of God’s Love to mankind. Beloved souls, there is much work to do, a great journey to take and much of it and you ascend and climb to higher heights, bringing greater capacities of the soul into play so that you may indeed do God’s work in powerful and evocative ways in the world. Beloveds, each day is the beginning of this journey. Each moment God beckons you forth and we all journey towards at-onement with God. 

Beloveds, you are my brothers and sisters. I embrace you, I love you, and I will continue upon my commitment to be with you and to guide you forward. Such beautiful souls. 

You open yourselves to the great gifts that our Heavenly Father gives to His precious children. All good and wonderful gifts shall be given, beloveds. All love shall pour upon you. Awakening upon awakening shall come. Knowings upon knowings shall erupt from your souls and bring you to that place of surety and wisdom. The Peace that passes all understanding shall be your mantle. The Light of God’s Touch shall be with you always. All angels in the Heavens shall know you, beloveds, and be at your beck and call. 

You have earned a great blessing and designation, beloved souls. In your dedications and prayers and longings, you invoke the response of Heaven and the deep Touch of God. This shall grow and intensify as you continue to seek higher and more gracious light upon you. 

Beloved souls, you walk upon the Divine Path that leads to at-onement with God. This you will never leave, but will continue to strive forward. In this journey, all blessings will come. All purposeful efforts, ordained by the Will of God, will flow and manifest in your lives. You will continue upon this great journey of love and serve many as you continue to grow and expand within your souls. 

Beloveds, beloveds I am with you. I am with you. God bless you. Your brother and friend is with you always. God bless you.
