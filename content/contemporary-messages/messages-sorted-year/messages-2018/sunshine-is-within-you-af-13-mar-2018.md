# Sunshine Is Within You

Â 

I am Goldie. (singing) Is there sunshine in your soul today? Does it matter if there are clouds when you carry the sunshine in your soul?

That sun warms you wherever you go and God brings you joy with His Love. There is sunshine here in your circle and you bring it into the world. Make sure you let your soul shine. Make sure you know that within you is great joy, a beautiful Light only to be brighter and more beautiful tomorrow and the next and the next. With this joy and Light, whatever conditions you may encounter, you will know such a beautiful sense of fulfillment and joy. Sunshine, my friends, is within you. Let it always be so.

I love you and I love to sing with you. God bless you. I am Goldie.
