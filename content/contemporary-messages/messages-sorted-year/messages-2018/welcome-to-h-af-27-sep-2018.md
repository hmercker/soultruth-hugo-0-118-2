My beloved daughter, you continue to walk in faith and serve in love in this world. I’ve been with you very, very often upon your journeys, your trials and tribulations, those efforts you’ve made on behalf of your brothers and sisters, your prayers and your work for love. I am well pleased with your progress beloved daughter, well pleased indeed, as you continue to strip away all barriers and that which prevents you from being fully awake in your soul. Your prayers as always are deep and go directly to God. This is the way in which you will continue to serve and to uphold the Will of God, your purpose in life, the work that awaits and grows as you continue to open and flourish in love. There is now little to hold you back my beloved daughter. You’re on the threshold of a great turning point in your life and I wish to say that all involved in this circle will indeed experience great shifts and awakenings within them while you are together. 

We are bringing all that we have to give to bear to each one of you, in a great effort to unlock the door that shall bring great service and blessings to mankind. We are at the ready my beloveds and we joyfully join you in your efforts. How God has engineered so many wondrous things in your lives and brought copious blessings to you. His great plan continues to unfold and mankind is on the verge of many changes, changes that will bring peace, bring deeper awakening and greater light to this world. You continue to be the harbingers of His Truth, of His Love and your lights shine beautifully beloved souls. You have much to give and God has great purpose for each one of you, as you walk forward in faith and trust, a strength building within your souls that will assist you in all these efforts and works that await you.

Always trust in the knowings of your souls beloveds, for this is where the deep truth resides. The answers to your questions emerge from this place of light and awakening, where God puts His Wisdom and you discover the gifts and wonderment of His blessings. May the joy of His Love continue to uplift you and awaken you and open the chambers of your souls so that its treasures may be released, gifts unfold, truth be revealed, with love washing over you beloveds, in great waves.

We continue to journey together and seek God’s counsel and blessings. May you hear the whispers of your soul and the knowings of your heart and the blessings of your Heavenly Father who seeks to bring together all parts of you, melded in love so that all is expressed and awakened that you may be a powerful and beautiful channel of love in the world. You will find your way beloved souls and you will express this truth in many wondrous ways. 

God bless you beloved souls. I am Martin Luther and I join you in your circle. God bless you.
