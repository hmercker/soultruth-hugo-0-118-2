God bless you. I am Matthew. We see the numbness and malaise that buries the soul under so many layers of non-feeling, non-awareness, unable to see beyond the condition that is immediate and unfulfilling. Every soul, every soul continues to cry out for liberation and for love. You have found a way to break those conditions within your lives and your beings so as to find a way to awaken from the deep slumbers that continue to entrap your brothers and sisters. You have found a way to know your own souls and to know the Source of all life and love. In this, the awakening of your souls continues to unfold. This liberation, this joy that comes with knowing the Father’s Love will continue to awaken you and show you the way. You not only do this for yourselves, beloved souls, but you do it for all your brothers and sisters. You bring the light of this Truth into your world through your prayers and longings, efforts to serve humanity within this flow of great Love. This river that continues to build, drawing in many souls, drawing in those who seek, those who are lost and those who seek to quench their thirst. This awakening grows and builds, as your souls stir in the touch of God’s Love. They stretch, move, and expand in this touch, awakening others from their deep slumbers. 

It is God’s Will and God’s plan that the entire world may awaken. God pours His Love, His activating Energies, onto the world. In this, the souls are stirred. They are not so comfortable in their slumbers. There is a sense, a need to awaken, to recognize that to be asleep through their lives is not what is intended. Though a mind may be very active indeed and a life may be filled with many things, with the soul asleep there can be no true life, no truth to life. It is merely walking through different experiences that are often meaningless. It does not grow the soul and the soul remains stagnant and without purpose. With the soul awakened and attuned to the Divine, many things may come to that soul. Many blessings may come through that soul. It is a fire that is lit from within. That fire may spread, given that each soul may bank the embers and make for itself a great bonfire given through prayer and blessings from God. This fuel warms the soul, creates the light, brings the wisdom, shows the way as it heals and awakens.

Beloveds, each of you carries this fire. Each of you longs for this awakening, and to some degree, each of you has come awake. May you continue to seek that which will enliven your souls and bring the fires of Love within. Seek God’s Touch, beloveds. Open yourselves to His Love. Be at peace, beloved souls, and know that you continue to find deeper and greater life within your life. A soul awakened is a beautiful, beautiful thing, full of potentials, gifts, abilities, perceptions, wisdom, joy and wonderment. These things are coming alive within each one of you. You are feeling the stirrings and awakenings with each day. With this comes a knowing and a deep peace. All the fears and concerns, worries and cares of yesterday start to drift away like smoke in the wind as God’s Breath awakens you. 

Beloved souls, be comforted in this sure knowledge that God’s Hand rests firmly upon you, that you are coming to know your true selves, that your souls are indeed awakening upon this beautiful journey of  life. May you continue to forge your relationship with the Creator and walk in light, walk in light, my beloveds. Seek to be in harmony, to allow Love to flow, that it may sink into every cell of your being, every thought of your mind, every chamber of your soul, that this beautiful gift may awaken every part of you. 

God bless you beloved souls, I am Matthew. I continue to be with you to witness your awakening and to assist in whatever way I can to help you to awaken and to adjust to this new way, this new consciousness of God, of your soul, of life, in this reality of God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
