Yes, I will be assisting this instrument and his mate in this venture of a mediumship retreat. She is correct in her perceptions that I will be a part of this as will the dear and beautiful angel Faith and many others. This is an important step for you, beloved souls, to introduce to many the subtleties and wonderment of Divine Love mediumship. Though it feels like a new venture for you, in many ways you have introduced these truths before and now you are applying it to the need to develop more mediums in the world who are able to bring forth the messages of the angels. 

As you have commented, I too, put some effort into developing mediums when I was on earth and I hope that I might be of assistance in guiding and inspiring you to teach others how to open this gift in a way that will sustain and reach for the highest. 

There are many eager people who want to be mediums and it is your job, beloved souls, to establish the standards and protocols that are required in order to be a Divine Love medium as you call it. This is important work. It will bring a wonderful gift and aspect to others’ lives. They will experience things they have not experienced before, come to know the truth like they have not known it before and in opening this door, you encourage those who are of interest to reach for the highest, to make that choice to be used as an instrument in this way, that they may walk with the angels in closer rapport. 

Each soul that is coming has a deep desire to be with God but not all of these souls are aware of how to fulfill this desire. So this must be a primary teaching. The way of Divine Love is the corner stone of all the work that you do, my beloveds. It must be taught as a foundation for any other teachings and you will be guided as to how to usher these precious souls along in this journey of discovery, that they may gently walk into this awakening and fulfillment of their gifts, a step by step understanding that must be firmly established with each one who is a candidate for this gift. Yes there are many who are coming in time who will have a deep desire to be opened in this way. 

You, my beloveds, must take this venture very seriously for you have a deep responsibility to accomplish this task in the light of Truth, in the light of God’s Will, so that you all may reach for the highest and you all may accomplish the tasks that are set before you. Every moment is a teachable moment. Every prayer is a gift and blessing. There is much for you to be aware of and to utilize in your soul perception so that you may teach clearly and concisely the steps towards this form of mediumship. 

We will be there, beloveds. We will be there in support. We will be there in communication and we will assist each soul who is coming so that they may understand and awaken to the prospects and gifts that are lying within them. 

Awakening the soul is always the goal, beloveds. It was my goal when I worked on your earth and it is your goal as well. Never forget that this is the most important part of the work, awakening the soul to the blessings of God’s Divine Love. You must repeat this and repeat this as I have done, as the angels have done, as you have done instilling within the minds of the curious what it is that they truly long for. 

This retreat has a serious component but also will have a component of joy and love, laughter, so I suggest to not take too seriously your responsibilities. Do not create an environment of seriousness and lack of love. You will know the balance. You will know how to bring the best and the highest with those who attend and you all have something to contribute to this, something important and you will all benefit as well. 

God gives you a gift here. A gift not only so you may give but also so you may learn and grow. In God’s universe many needs are met, many blessings are given, and much wisdom comes with each blessing. May you continue to serve God in these beautiful ways. The world needs more of you to work together, to serve, to bring humanity to a place of further enlightenment and knowledge and love. All these efforts that you make help the world by bringing greater light and in this venture that you are committed to, you will ignite candles that will ignite candles until the whole world is awakened in light.

God bless you, your friend Alec is with you and I will indeed speak to the crowds and give some of my wisdom and be with you each day in your efforts. God bless you. I am always with you, your brother, your friend, who loves you so. God bless you. God bless you.
