# Fun in Hawaii!

January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

I see that this instrument worries about too many things. He worries that you shouldn’t pray and have fun together. He is too serious in his thinking. God wants you to have fun, to be happy and joyful in your work and He gives you this gift to be together in this beautiful place in prayer. He worries about how this particular place will be appropriate for your efforts and I say that you may pray anywhere and be joyful, not to be too concerned about the material things. It is the fact that you are together in joyful communion and prayer and in your efforts for direct voice this is what is important, beloveds. 

All these other ventures and adventures there will be joy as well, and opportunities still unrecognized that are coming. It will be a very full and beautiful time for you, my beloveds. Take the gift from God. Be joyful in the reception of this gift that brings you together in love. Those who cannot come will be drawn in, will be drawn in and feel a part of this. 
God bless you. I love you. I look forward to our times together in prayer in that beautiful place as do many other angels who work with you and pray with you and love you. God bless you. Goldie loves you.
