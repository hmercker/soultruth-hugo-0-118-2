God is upon you beloved souls. Follow me to at-onement with God and I shall lead the way. I shall light the lantern of truth and light it for all those who so desire to follow upon this path of Love. I am Jesus and I am with you in your efforts to discern truth, to walk in light, to gather Love within your souls. I am with you as you struggle in this world, as you continue to peel back the layers of illusion and error, to come to that place of clarity and truth. I am with you when you discover the joys of your soul, as you seek your Heavenly Father and receive His blessings of Love. I am with you as you pray, for I pray with you and pray for you beloved souls. I walk with my lantern of truth. I walk in the light of God’s Love. Follow me and I will show you the wonderment of God’s Creation and the power of His Love. 

God bless you beloved souls. I am with you and I love you my dear friends, brothers and sisters all. God bless you.
