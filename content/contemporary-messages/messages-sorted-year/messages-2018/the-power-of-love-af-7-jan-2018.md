I welcome you beloveds. Yes, I am Lotus Blossom.

The world is bereft of love. The world is lost because it does not know how to love. This is your challenge beloved beautiful souls to seek the way of love. To walk in the world as a channel of love. To be with God in love. To know your true selves in love. For love is the most powerful force in the universe beloved souls. I know it is hard to see in this world, but it is true that when you can walk in the world with love, not judgement, not fear, but love, you will make a difference. You will help many other souls who are bereft in one way or another because they do not see the power of love. There are many out there my beloveds, many in this world who need love, who need to understand the power of love and who are hurting and in pain, confusion and depression, fear and error. They are in so many different conditions that are dark and painful and here you are in this beautiful place to be uplifted, to cleanse yourselves of these conditions of the world and to seek God. And so God reaches to you beloveds. God reaches to His children so that they may be uplifted in Light that they may know love and be love and express love in this world. God relies on those souls in the world who aspire to be a channel of love, to live by love and to express love. 

It is your invitation each and every day to live in love, to understand the beauty and complexities of love and to know that you are loved by your Heavenly Father who loves all His children. Recognize this in your lives beautiful souls, and bring this love into your heart and live this love each and every day and you will find great joy within you, great joy and peace and many, many blessings will come to each soul who earnestly prays for the Father’s Love, the Divine Love.

God bless you beloved souls. God bless you and may you continue to be uplifted in Light and may we from the Celestial Heavens come close to each and every one of you. You may ask for our help. You may ask to be uplifted but the greatest effort must come in your efforts to be with God and to receive His Love. May this be so in your lives and all blessings shall come from this. 

God bless you beloveds. I am Lotus Blossom and I love you. God bless you beautiful souls, beautiful souls. God bless you.
