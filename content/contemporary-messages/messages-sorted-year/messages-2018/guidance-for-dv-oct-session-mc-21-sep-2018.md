Received by Maureen Cardoso

Â 

It is Seretta Kem and I thank you for being willing to sit and receive a message regarding the time your circle will be sharing together in the very near future, this intense time working toward the realization of direct voice.  

You have asked for greater guidance and clarity regarding the impressions and guidance the dear soul has received.  He was impressed that this time coming together was of great importance and feeling perhaps this is a last attempt for the success of this gift of direct voice.  We do not wish to discourage you or to worry you that the success of this time together is dependent upon whether we continue toward this project in the future after this intense time together.  

There has been much our side of life has done and the dedication of time and effort, and there has also been the dedication of your time and effort to this most extraordinary project.  Beloveds, we are deeply grateful for your time, your effort, your commitment and your desire, for without it we could not have come this far. There is great hope from all of us, which includes you, that this project will be set afoot in your world. So as you prepare for coming together at this time for your intensive session over this one month, we would like to impress upon you how crucial it is for your focus and your attention to this matter.  

Your time together will need peace amongst you, joy and love amongst you.  Do your best to allow any stressors in your life to rest during this time and go deeper and deeper into your union with your beloved Creator developing even a deeper bond, for this will be most helpful. It is not to say that we will abandon the project should your intensive time together not be the success that we are hoping for, but as you know the many changes that are occurring in this world will have an impact upon the ease of coming together. Each of your lives will have their demands. Beloveds, as you know, with the many gifts that are opening for each of you, the doors that are opening for each of you, you will continue to serve God. This project is but one part of serving God. 

Of course, we from our side of life do wish for the success, yet we wish to be realistic in what the future holds. It may not be so easy to bring you all together in the future. This is not to say that you cannot continue your simultaneous prayers when this intensive time has been completed. We would encourage you to continue with this dedication in your prayers. The focus that is going to be asked of each of you, to aim higher than you have ever aimed before, will be most instrumental in having this time together for the development of this gift. Each of you have dedicated as best you can to this project which we are all deeply, deeply grateful for. You have all come closer to God, you have all awakened more deeply in your souls. Is that not one of the highest gifts available to mankind? There are many instrumental aspects of each of your growths since the beginning of this project. This will remain forevermore and you will continue to grow in your relationship with your beloved Creator.  

We do ask though that you review your desires, that you go deep within your soul looking honestly at how you feel towards this gift and what it may mean in your lives should it become something that is realized. This may sound somewhat serious for you to hear, though beloveds it is a serious measure that I speak of. It is not to create doubt and worry within you for the success of the gift. We will see when you come together in your circle of seven at what point we begin to work from as we continue toward this great gift. It is a crucial time for this development and we greatly appreciate you going deep with great sincerity, looking into yourselves, seeing with clarity your desire for this gift and your intentions for this gift. Take this time before you come together. Become very clear within yourself in your commitment to the gift and to God. This too will be instrumental for the continuation of the project. As you come together, as always, there will be greater clarity, guidance and love. We do not abandon this gift, though we do wish to impress upon you the importance of this time that you have each taken out of your lives in coming together in purity of heart, mind, body and soul. Once again, it is our deep gratitude for the dedication that you have each put towards this gift and your own personal development of soul, for without your deep, great efforts none of this is possible. Know that our love is with you.  

I am Seretta Kem and I thank you for revisiting your dedication toward this gift as the time is very near and approaching when your dear circle of seven come together once again, working toward the development of direct voice.

God bless each of you. My love is with you. I am Seretta Kem and I love you.
