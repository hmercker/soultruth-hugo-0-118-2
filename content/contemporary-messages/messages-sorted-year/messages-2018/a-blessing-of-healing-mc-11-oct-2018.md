I am Guru Ram Das. I reside in the Celestial Heavens. I was the fourth Guru of the Sikh tradition known for my healing gifts. I wish to let you know, as you have been told before, that there are many that heal with you and that are with you and who fall outside of those celestial angels that you are well acquainted with. I wish to let you know that I serve you, that I serve in love and that I come and bring my healing to each of you and to this dear soul now. I thank you for being open to receive the blessing from others who have walked in different traditions while on earth, for we all serve humanity through God’s Love. We only wish to bring that love to you. I bring you a blessing of healing upon each of you and this dear soul who lies upon this bed before you. 

God bless each of you. Our love is with you. I am Guru Ram Das and I reside in the Celestial Heavens. God bless you.
