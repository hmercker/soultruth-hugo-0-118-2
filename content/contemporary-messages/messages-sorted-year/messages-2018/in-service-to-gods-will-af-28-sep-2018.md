I am Mary. You are blessed in your endeavours together, beloved souls, to help the children who are vulnerable and need your love and support. You will continue to give this support in many ways. God’s Hand is upon this work. Your prayers are important to bring to fruition what is needed and to influence those who have control and power to release and to be supportive. Your prayers are needed. Your prayers are needed for all the children of the world. For they must navigate the difficult conditions of this world. Many of them live in poverty and deprivation. Your prayers are needed, beloveds.
Support will be given to you, beloved daughter, as you continue to navigate through the conditions within this place that you work. In time, my beloved daughter, you will be released from this responsibility for there are other plans waiting for you, other work that is coming. You sense this and you are ready to release your concerns and desire to lead this group, beloved daughter. When your orphanage is built, it will be time, though you will always have a connection and a tie with this band of beautiful souls. Your work will expand out into the world, many places and many situations that need love. You will be that channel of love as will be you all, beloved souls, as will be you all, channels of love in the world. 

To walk in the world as a channel of love requires that you are open and receptive to guidance and willing to step forward, to release yourselves to God’s Will, to find your purpose in God’s Will, to know God’s Will that bubbles forth from your soul as He implants ever greater quantities of His Love within you. So comes a great awakening and understanding of God’s Will. 

Very few in your world are awakened in this way and those that are, are very precious to God.  His Desire is that you walk along the path that He designs and designates for you. In this way His Will and Wisdom will be enacted in your life. He will carry you along a marvellous road full of many opportunities to serve in love, to teach in love, to help God’s Will to be enacted in the world, His blessings that flow, the healings to come, the harmony to be established amongst your brothers and sisters. To know with surety and deep wisdom what is needed becomes a great asset to God’s work and plan for the salvation of mankind. So as you are able to listen deeply, to understand the language of God’s Love, the desire of God’s Intention for the world, then you will become an effective and beautiful channel of love in the world. You must continue to pray for this blessing of love so that the awakening intensifies and the changes are established within you so that you may have the gifts, the wisdom and the understanding to act in love, to act in harmony with God’s Laws of Love. 

It is very simple and yet very difficult. With all the conditions of your world pressing upon you, it is not easy to pull away from these conditions and be in the purity of God’s Presence and know the wonderment of God’s Will. Yet you are very close, many of you are very close to this understanding. This will come more intensely and clarity will be yours, beloveds, a deep clarity, a deep strength and wisdom, a deep love and compassion for all of humanity. It begins to awaken within you, deep within, that fire burning and growing, warming your soul, cleansing your soul and emerging into your conscious self. This process continues and rises up and becomes a part of you, truly a part of you. 

You are deeply blessed, beloveds. There are many more projects to come, many more opportunities to serve God, many ways in which you may serve God. So much is possible in the flow of God’s Love and Will. You cannot understand in your minds but you will understand within your souls. You will see the perfect plan emerge and be a part of this in coming days and months and years. There will be much to do. May you be ready, beloveds, and strong in love, pure in your hearts, loving in your intentions, and bright within your souls. God bless you, I am Mary and I love you. God bless you, beautiful and beloved souls eager to serve, eager to love. God bless you.
