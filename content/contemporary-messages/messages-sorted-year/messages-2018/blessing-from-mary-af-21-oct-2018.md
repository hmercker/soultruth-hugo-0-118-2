God bless you, I am Mary and I am with you in your efforts to garner more light within your souls and to bring the blessings of the Father’s Love that they may enter every chamber of your soul, beloveds. I am with you in all efforts you make for light and truth, in all love that you give and are able to receive from God. May you continue to be a channel of God’s Love in the world, beloved souls. I touch you all. I am with you all in love. I embrace you all as God’s children, beloveds. I shall come another day and speak to you of things of God. God bless you, beloveds, each one, beautiful, precious souls of God, children in my family of love. God bless you.
