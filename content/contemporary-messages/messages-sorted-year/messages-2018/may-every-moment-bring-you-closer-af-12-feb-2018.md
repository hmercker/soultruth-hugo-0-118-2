I am Keea Atta Kem. Precious, beautiful lights, you each walk a different path, a unique path, a path of discovery of your true selves, a path in which you will find your relationship with God deepen with each day, with each prayer and with each effort you make to be in the Light and to open your soul to God. For it is in this opening, this blessing, comes the awakening and the understandings which assist you in your lives. This precious life that each of you walks within, filled with choices and experiences, with love, with Light, with challenges and with the difficulties that come with dealing with the conditions of this world. Each of you needs to be anchored in Love and Light to truly know yourselves, your souls and to seek for the blessings that God so eagerly wishes to give to you, my beloveds, that you may be strong in Light and that you may know peace and joy in your lives.

This gift of life is filled with so much potential and yet you must walk within your daily lives with wisdom, strength and love. This must emerge from your souls, beloveds, the awakening of your souls through receiving the Father’s Love that opens many doorways, that brings to your attention the wondrous opportunities that God has placed before you by giving you this gift of life. Yes, my beloveds, each breath is a choice to be in the Light or to join in the human condition in all its tumultuous aspects and layers of suffering, confusion and error. 

When one is fully attuned to the soul these many complex challenges that come with living in this human condition become simplified, so rather than merely engaging with your perceptions of the material mind, you will add into your understanding the perceptions of the soul. As the soul becomes awakened these perceptions become more astute and pierce the mind with clarity and Truth. In this comes many other aspects of the soul, a deep compassion and love for your brothers and sisters, a deep awareness of God’s Presence in your lives and the presence of His angels who also assist you in your daily experiences and challenges. So you see, this Love brings a great strength, a great clarity, a great capacity to love. This is in accordance to the yearnings of your soul for each of you yearns to be in this harmony and Light, to be a channel of Love in this world, to live a life that is full of goodness that is bountiful in love and that is wise and secure in the ways of God. 

God compels you to walk this path of Love, to make each moment of this gift of life a precious moment, an important moment, to live in a way that is profound and powerful and meaningful. We have one here who is just beginning a life, a precious child in all his beauty and grace. You my beloveds, are given an opportunity to help this child know the Truth of God, to reinforce what his soul already knows, so that he is a child of God. So you may give of yourself in love to this blessed child and you may give with love to one another to reinforce and to help each one of you to reach for something higher, to reach for the Light, to be in that place of deep awareness and loving commitment to the Truth and the beauty of your own creation. You see there are many opportunities with each day, opportunities to nurture your souls, your true selves, to nurture one another, to nurture all those who are upon your path. In this way comes meaning, clarity and purpose. In this way you may become a channel of God’s Love, for this world is in such need of love. 

The highest purpose of all is to give Love in this world, to express Love in this world, to bring the healing that comes with Love, the comfort that comes with Love, the Truth that comes with Love. For as you uplift yourselves and you uplift your brothers and sisters, so the world changes and comes to a place of true recognition of the gift of life. Bring yourselves to that place of acknowledging the beauty of who you are, the wonderment of your own being, created by God. In this all else will follow, for as you nurture your souls in Love, so the capacities and potentials of the soul come forth and come to fruition that you may be God’s Instruments of service to others, that you may discover your own potentials and possibilities, that you may express the highest aspirations of your soul and the Will of God in your lives. This all comes with the blessings of the Father’s Essence, the Divine Love. Seek this, beloved souls. Open yourselves to receive, open wide with a yearning to have this gift, to possess this gift within you, to receive all that God has to give to you. So much awaits your yearnings, the openings of your soul, the understandings of your heart and the expressions of your love.

God smiles upon you, my beloved, and the angels surround you. You are given all that you require to truly know yourselves and express your highest aspirations and desires. Make each moment in your lives a precious moment. May each step have meaning and purpose and may all the experiences that come with life create a steady upliftment, an ascendancy into greater Light, closer to God, truer to yourselves, more fully awake and alive.

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you. I see your lights and I know you, each one and I love you. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you. God bless you.
