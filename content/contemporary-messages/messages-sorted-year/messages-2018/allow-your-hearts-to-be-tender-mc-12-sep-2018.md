Â 

I wish to say that I have been with you the entire time you have been gathered together. It is a great blessing to see the many children come together, embracing one another in love and joy. I wish to say, the great blessing that man and woman are to each other, and what a dear prayer the beloved soul said earlier today, for the men of the world to be nurtured and loved. For their hearts are tender and their love is of a great capacity. 

The tenderness of a woman brings forth the great heart of man. The women have been gifted with an extraordinary ability to love and nurture deeply. It is when they share their heart with their mates, the men in their lives, whether it be sons, fathers, husbands or others, it allows the love of a man to be gentle and provides a safe place for expression. The care and support a man desires to share in this world requires a tender heart; a tender heart within them and a tender heart to receive them. 

My dear children, allow your hearts to be tender to one another, to receive this tenderness, and to give this tenderness. As you all well know, the Love of God in your souls, expands this ability and strengthens your capacity to be a channel of love to one another. 

It is an important time that you are all walking on this earth, to spread love wherever you go. But the dear gift that man and woman are to one another please beloveds, have a tenderness for that space, that sacred space God has created. 

Each of you are deeply loved and watched over. It is my great pleasure to watch over the children of earth and to be close to them. For the dear women in this room, when you struggle, when tasks seem so great, call upon me and I will be with you to help you walk through your day to touch all of those who God has placed in your life, to be a loving essence for each of them. God bless you my beloved children. I love you deeply and care for each of you. I am Mary. God bless you and I love you.
