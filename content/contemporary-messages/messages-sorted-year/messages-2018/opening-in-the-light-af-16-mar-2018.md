God bless you, I am Andrew. Yes, there is much to be grateful for is there not, in a life that is blessed by God. One may even be grateful for being grateful, to feel this sense of gratitude and joy of what fortunes come your way and a life that is given over to God's Will and blessings, His Touch upon you.

In this opening and relaxing of your will to God, all that is good, all that is beautiful and uplifting, comes in the great wave of Love, swept away upon this river of Love. God carries you, embraces you, opens you to ever greater Love and wisdom and joy. Let this blessing of Love be absorbed by every part of you, every cell in your body, every layer and aspect of your being may be affected, healed, transformed by the power of God's Love within your souls. In this comes great joy, profound gratitude and profound wisdom, for God fulfills every need, every true desire, every intention that is of a good and harmonious desire of the soul.

You are at this moment immersed in Love. Breathe it in, my beloveds. Seek this Touch ever deeper and deeper, going into all those crevices and dark places within you, healing all that is not an expression of Love and may be expelled from you, my beloveds, and stand in pure Light. To be that beautiful soul that God has created in all its uniqueness, all its dazzling beauty so that all that it can be shall be. You and God shall stand together in profound joy, in dazzling Light. You stand with God at this moment. May your souls open wide, ready to receive, to be awakened, to know that deep peace where nothing exists except you and God in this holy communion.

Let us be together in this circle of Light, far beyond the worries and cares of this world to that place of profound knowing and being with God. Open now, my beloveds, open now. His blessings pour upon you. He washes you in Love. He nourishes you and gives you what your hearts desire. He is with us now, His Love pouring down through this portal of Light. You open like the budding flower, blossoming in the Light, your fragrance pleasing God, your beauty flowing in communion with God.

God bless you, beloveds. God is blessing you.
