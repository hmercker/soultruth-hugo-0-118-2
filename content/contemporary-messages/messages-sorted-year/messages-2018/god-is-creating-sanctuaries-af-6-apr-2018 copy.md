God bless you beloveds. God is creating sanctuaries of Light in your world. For these are times of change and upheaval that will cause great concern for humanity. And you must create in this place, a place of refuge, a place where the lost souls may come and find some answers. The angels of heaven will manifest in this place in time and this will draw many who will be curious, who will yearn for this blessing. And you will all be a part of this plan that will bring awakening to those who come and comfort and Love. You will see my beloveds; you will see how God works and will work through each one of you and others who are coming. 

God bless you. I am Jesus and I bless you in your efforts in the yearnings of your souls to do those works that God has put within you to be expressed in this world. Much is coming and I will be with you always beloveds. And continue to pray over your beautiful little sanctuary. God bless you. I am with you in Love. I will carry you forth in Light. Continue in your prayers and your efforts, your desires to bring what is meant to be to fruition. It is a test of your faith and the strength of your soul, and the Love that you carry. Do not step back, but step forward and carry all those you can into the Light and truth and beauty of God’s blessings upon this place. 

God bless you beloveds. I am with you. I am your brother and your friend. I am Jesus.
