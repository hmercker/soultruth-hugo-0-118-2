# Vicky Forest’s First Message from Spirit

September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

 

**Keea:** I come to introduce a friend of yours, one you love, and we are going to allow her to come to speak to you today.

**Vicky:** Hello, my friends, it is Vicky. I hope these are tears of joy because I am very joyful (Jeanne says “…and skinny”) Yes! I do not have that burden any more of the flesh and I want you to know that all that
our friends talked about was true in my passing. It was very peaceful, and I want you to assuage your fears about my choosing to go that there may be consequences.<sup>1</sup> My friends, there were no consequences other than release and freedom and joy because God is compassionate my friends. God is compassionate, He does not judge. He gives freely
His Love and peace. And I know that it is difficult for you to understand the pain that I was in and the discomfort and physical condition, but I was very close to passing anyway I just foreshortened the time and as
you know I love to organize, and I organized this in the way that only I could do.

Allan be at peace my beloved, beloved. Know that I am closer to you now than I have ever been. I love you so. And yes, you have life to live yet and I want you, I so dearly want you to live life to the fullest, joy as
you say, yes joy, as much joy as possible.

And I see so clearly now how we all have choices. We all can live life fully and beautifully, joyfully or allow these conditions in the world to hold us back. As you pray here together my friends, I know it is difficult for you to see the Light, the beauty, the angels that surround you, all this life that is with you at this moment and it is easy for me to see with
my spirit eyes and I tell you that this is a great gift to all of you.

Continue to seek out God in all that you do. This is so important. If you only had the clarity that I have now to see what I see now. But you will. It is coming to each one of you. My beloved friends do not give up on
your quest for spiritual awakening for love, for joy. These things are the most important and if you can be that way in the world, you will touch so many others. You will give what the world so needs my friends.

And release all your fears about death because I want to tell you it is a beautiful thing, so peaceful, such a release from the burdens of life and to go into the world of spirit and discover all of its wonder. Oh, my
beloved, beloved friends, it is so beautiful and you all will come to these bright and beautiful places and see for yourself one day and know as you progress, come to know yourselves and know God, you will ascend
and come to know life more fully in these beautiful realms.

And my dear friend Albert, I want you to know that when I walk in the gardens I think of you. How much joy you would take in to see this beauty. How wonderful is God, His gifts of life.

Life is so much fuller here, so much more, so much more. I am supremely happy and yes, I come and visit each one of you and many more of my friends to bring my joy to you. And yes, when I passed there was indeed a party, a joyful party, renewing my friendships with old
friends and family, loved ones and I must say it is and was the best party I have ever had and part of me felt so sorry for you all here in this life that is not so uplifting, but I am so glad that you are trying and
praying, supporting one another. You have found the right way to be in the world my friends. It will bring its rewards. It will bring joy to you, to
your hearts and I understand now the power of God’s Love, to truly understand it and I see the Light glowing in all of you my friends.

Please continue to pray and come together in this beautiful Circle of Light and I will come too. If you had any idea of how many are with you, how many are here to support you, how many are here to listen to you
and how many are here because they are lost. It is important that you continue and build these circles to be in the Light, to be strong in the Light.

There is so much that you need to do in this world and I know my friends that you work hard. You meet many people. You give your love. Believe me, this is important. Though it may be inconvenient for you at
times, it is important because you plant the seeds of truth and you give love and hope to many. And in this way, you fulfill God’s desire for His children.

For all of you to work in the world for Light. Think of you what you can do my friends. Think of the possibilities. Think of how you might serve
others in ways that are important and meaningful and in this way many blessings will come to you.

I entered this (third) sphere as a result of my efforts in the world, my desires to be useful, helpful to others and I had a belief in God. I prayed. I sought to
be close. It may not have been in the way that you are so dedicated but nonetheless it was my personal effort to bring Light into my soul and this gave to me a great blessing of Light. My friends I am with you in your
efforts. I will continue to pray for you and I hope you continue to pray for me and in this way coming to God with your true self, your true feelings, your true desires, is a powerful way to bring change and blessings in the world.

Be true to yourself my friends. Be loving and kind. Seek to help others. Be strong in love and joy and I will say goodbye and know that I love you
all. Blessings to you. Blessings to you.

**Keea:** How much your friend loves you all and even though you did not know her in the flesh for many years, you created a strong bond of love and many opportunities came about both in the flesh and in your sleep states to forge this bond together. And of course, her dear mate, who has been with you on many occasions, had his influence and affect for this beloved daughter.

**Note 1.** Vicky was in great pain at the end of her life and was accepted into the Canadian assisted dying process. This message is very significant in that it is the only message we have ever received from someone who followed such a path to end their life. It is thus very comforting to know that such decisions have no negative consequences.
