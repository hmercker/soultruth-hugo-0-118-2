# Acknowledgement of On-Line Prayer Circle, Encouragement for D.V.

October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Maureen Cardoso

Â 

Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem.  I wish to acknowledge your efforts today with the outreach that you have drawn in many that would not in regular circumstances be able to pray and gather in a community of Divine Love seekers. When you reach out in such a way over the wires, does it not make your world feel close and small? For though you are each praying in your respective homes, many of you felt as though you were with one another in a physical sense. As you continue on with prayer in this way, you will find that it will draw in many from around the world and you will touch many. 

Thank you for drawing in all those souls and keeping communication lines open with them, for my dear daughter you do have a great gift of helping others to feel as though they matter. When you engage with them in a most honest and loving way, they sincerely feel they can pour their heart out to you. That is an exceptional channel of love my dear. Please continue in this deep way of working for God, hearing your guidance, and knowing that this way in which you touch many is a part of your great gifts, one of many of your gifts. 

Yes, our dearly beloved angel, Keea-atta Kem has been appointed as the one who will oversee this group. Of course, others will come with teachings and to be near you, for we all wish to serve, but dear Keea has been given the task of watching over this special group. 

Now as your circle is about to come together again tomorrow after your couple of days break, these next number of days together we ask that you continue as you have, being focused on your awakening and your dedication to creating a deeper bond with your beloved Creator, and taking those visions and insights that you have received in your prayers and meditation and your alone time with your Heavenly Father, take all of that and use it in a way that helps you to stay steady, to stay focused, and to stay committed as we know you are. This week ahead is very important. It is our hope that each of your developments and your soul awakening reaches a new depth, with new awarenesses and a greater understanding of your soul with a deep connection so that each of you may recognize your true selves to a much greater degree than when you first arrived together. Beloveds, this time this coming week is important. We continue to dedicate to you and we see your dedication to yourselves, to God, and we see your deep appreciation for your angel friends. We are only happy to serve. So we will gather again in the morning and have our last portion of this time together. 

Rest well, beloveds. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem and I love you. God bless you.
