# Opening Message Mediumship Retreat

August 26<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

I am your teacher Augustine. Are we ready to begin upon this journey of discovering the awakening of the potentials within you? Do you have the kind of faith within you that says I may indeed be used as a channel of love in this world, that I have gifts that God has given me and I wish to utilize these gifts for the benefit of others? May I walk in this world with love as my impetus and desire. Do I know God and His Will for me? Can I be open and innocent, humble and filled with gratitude? 

You are all worthy beloved souls, and each of you has a great potential. Many of you may speak as I speak through this instrument. Many of you may communicate with we in spirit in some way so that we may forge a connection, a bond that is real and palpable in your lives. This may be accomplished because you have yearned for and received the blessings of Divine Love, the great essence of God flowing into your souls and the power of this essence is what makes these things possible. 

Each of you in your souls, beloveds, has a deep desire to be with God, to love God, and to serve in love and to bring blessings to your brothers and sisters as God’s living channels of love in this world. That channel may begin as a faint glimmer, an opening in the crack of your consciousness, but it will expand and grow as this blessing of God’s Love expands and grows within your souls. It must, for with the Law of Love comes this flow of Love, not only into you, but around you and through you. Your life will be lit by the Light of God’s Love. Your being will emanate love and be transformed by this great gift of Love. In this transformation, the awakening of the soul as we have called it, many gifts come to the fore. An awakening of many things within you, things that you are not aware of and have not anticipated. You do not realize what lies within your soul, seeds planted by God at the beginning of your creation, ready to sprout, ready to take life and be alive within you. 

All is possible through this great gift of God’s living waters, which you must drink and drink with gusto, like a thirsty man in the desert. For indeed you live upon a sort of desert that is parched and lacks love, lacks these living waters and the abundance which God has intended for this world but has been destroyed and rejected. Man has turned away from the very essence that will nurture their souls. Beloveds, it is your soul that is your true selves. It is your soul that is the greatest gift that God has given to you. Within the  soul, all of the potentials and gifts reside and await your choice and your efforts to bring to them life, life that comes from God, His great soul feeding your precious and tender souls. 

God is your gardener and you are all flowers within His garden. Each of you has a deep desire to flourish within that garden, to be beautiful for God, to show God the wonderment of His own creation, the beauty that is you, unique and wonderful, glorious in the Light of His Love. 

At this very moment you are drawing in these living waters, feeding your souls, hoping that indeed these hidden potentials will be realized and this beauty will emerge. It is a process that takes time and effort. Like anything in God’s universe, there are steps to take, an incremental growth, a slow realization of what can be to that point of being. So you come to these circles. Some come with curiosity, some with purpose, some with a surety that they are guided, all with a desire to join together in this upliftment and light, that God may bless you all and set you further upon your journey of awakening. 

You sit beseeching God to bless your soul and indeed God answers your prayers. Indeed God answers them with such abundance that He fills this place with light and love, all the energies and nurturance to cultivate your souls and your beings so that you may reach a higher place of awareness and realization of your gifts. The expanding of your souls in love, beloveds, is what brings to you what it is that you seek. This is the very foundation of what you call Divine Love mediumship. Without it, it cannot be realized. 

Yes the gift of mediumship is within each individual in some permutation. But to reach for the highest, beloveds, which is what you are doing, requires this gift of Divine Love. It is the fuel that moves the potential forward and makes it a reality. Each of you are at a different place upon the continuum of realizing these potentials. Surprisingly some of you have opened up great potentials, but still struggle with your minds that deny you these gifts. Yet they sit, awaiting your permission to be expressed in your life. 

Your minds have such power of you, beloved souls. It is a reflection of the human condition in which you live, and the many distractions, that bring you away from your simple and innocent selves, and that place of soul. It is our hope in these days to come, that the layers of resistance, the layers of the mind, may be shed and you will come to a closer acknowledgement and acceptance of your soul, that all the potentials that lie within you may find acceptance from you and that you desire to nurture them, to make them real in your consciousness. For without your acceptance and desire and faith, they cannot be realized and they remain hidden behind a curtain. 

The world needs the awakening of your gifts and all gifts from all souls, so that the equilibrium and balance may be reached, that which is so desperately needed in the world. For the world must recognize a different way, a different approach to life. One that includes the soul. One that allows the soul, the realization of its deep desire to be with God. In this union of soul and God, soul and Great Soul, these many gifts come to life. In this, each expresses their uniqueness and beauty in the world.

There is no greater journey my beloveds. No more wondrous experience and awakening than this. It is why God gave you life and it is a fulfillment of God’s desire that you live life and live life abundantly. All that you require will be given by God if you are willing to accept His gifts and accept your own. Beloved souls, walk in the light of God’s Love. Realize the great potentials within you. Acknowledge your own souls. Acknowledge the truth of God’s existence and the reality of God and all of His creation. It is this awakening to the consciousness of God that brings everything.

Consider this, beloved souls, consider how the world is asleep and lacks these awarenesses. It is desensitized to the tender and vibrant soul and instead gives great credence to the mind and intellect. Yet everyone in your world senses that there is something vital missing. This sets them upon a course to crave distractions, to crave love and fulfillment from others rather than to turn their eyes to God, where all is given as with this great blessing all flows in abundance and fulfillment. 

You continue to open your eyes and turn them to God, and in this, you forge a path for others. Many of you here will be used by God to help others find their way. God is igniting a great light within each of you and the power and beauty of that light will touch many souls as you go forth in the world. Here, as you come together, you are igniting a greater light within you. God continues to open the many avenues and possibilities of your souls, creating a deeper bond, a powerful connection and understanding of His presence, of His being. This will go on for all eternity, my beloveds as you continue the journey with all its beauty and discoveries, its power and grace, bringing a deep joy within your soul knowing that your soul has found its mark, its place, which is with God. 

God bless you beloveds. May God bless you deeply with His Love. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you. God bless you.
