God bless you, I am Seretta Kem. You are building such a beautiful light here with your prayers, with your conversations and actions together. You are creating greater harmony and light as you go along building, building, building greater light with your prayers, your intentions and with your love. We add to this as well, with our efforts and God blesses us all does He not, as we continue to reach ever higher to the Fountainhead of all Love.  

Beloved souls, may you continue in the awakening, the quickening of your souls as you pray, as you yearn and lean towards God beseeching Him to assist you in this birthing process. To bravely step forward and say I am ready for this great shift within to come forth in my life, in my being, in my thoughts, in my actions and in my soul. With the power of love all things are possible. With the power of the love within your soul you will come to know the potentials that lie within it. The beauty and love yearns to come and be expressed in your world and a great flow of God’s Love wishes to flow through you in great abundance as you become an ever-clearer channel of His Love. 

As the faculties of your souls begin to awaken, you will have the vision, the clarity and the understanding that you require to go out into the world equipped with the strength and wisdom that you need. The love will flow so that many are touched with this powerful truth, igniting a great flame of love that shall spread and spread, cleansing the world of the darkness, turning it to light and purity. So you bring the flames together as you come into this circle and this creates a light, a fire, that is seen far and wide. It can only build and become brighter, reaching out into the heavens, reaching out to many places and to many souls in God’s universe. By your efforts, beloved souls, you are igniting a great revolution of thought, of understanding, of love. One that will embrace God once more and release the cold conditions of the mind, transforming the reality of mankind from these darkened, steely attitudes and actions that think only of self and power and safety and fear to an opening of the hearts of all so that they may rejoice together in a great celebration and appreciation of life. You step forward my beloved friends, igniting the flames through your prayers, your actions and your efforts. They will indeed bring forth great works, a loving light flowing over the landscape, healing as it goes and transforming. You are a part of this great plan for the salvation of mankind my beloveds. It begins with each breath you take, each thought you have, each prayer that you give, each time you reach out to God to receive another blessing of your soul.

You are enacting God’s plan in this way and you beseech humanity to lay down their armor, their fears, their error and all things that are not of God, and join you in this wonderful revelatory time, awakening your souls to all the wondrous possibilities and blessings that may come. We gather together my beloved children. We are with God. We bathe in the same pool, the same love, we are gifted together, awakening ever more fully with the Touch of God.

You will know in your lifetimes your own awakened soul and it will burn bright. It will carry you far. It will show you the way, as God’s Will is reflected in your soul and you will come to know this clearly and act accordingly. You will come to recognize the power of God’s Love for you and for all and this will motivate you in your work, your service to God, with each playing their role in this mighty plan that shall sweep over the world.

We are together in this my friends, part of the great continuum of service in love. God bless you, beloved souls. Serretta Kem is with you. God bless you.
