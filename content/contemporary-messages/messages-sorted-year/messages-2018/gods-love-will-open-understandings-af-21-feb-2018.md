I am Isaiah. God has brought you together my beloveds. His Hand is upon each one of you. Remember the blessings that you have received in your time together will be shared with those you love, that much flows out to them as it does to you my beloveds. You are within this great wave of Light and Love.

Seek this gift of the Father’s Love in your lives. For those who are unfamiliar with this gift, add it to your prayers and life with God. Allow this blessing to be part of your awareness, that this aspect of God is a great boon to your soul. It merely requires your small effort in prayer, a desire from your heart to know His Love in order to be in that great flow of His Love. To do this in a conscious way, in a consistent way, adding to your prayers each day will open up new doors and avenues of experience and knowledge and understanding, for you will come to know God in a way that many in this world do not. 

You will come to know your own souls in a deeper way, in a way that will reveal to you many aspects of yourselves that is not yet known. You will come to recognize many gifts within you beloveds and you will come to see others with greater love, acceptance, compassion and bring to them wisdom that comes from God through your souls, the souls that have been ignited with His Divine Love. Such a simple thing brings great rewards my beloveds. There is no greater reward than at-onement with God and His gift of Love makes this possible.

It is not necessary to adopt a creed, a religion, a way of thinking. It is merely accepting the possibility that through your own relationship with God in prayer and seeking this gift of Love, acknowledging the desires within your souls for at-onement that all is possible and will enhance everything within you and within your lives.

This Truth, the understanding of this Truth, was lost many, many years ago and now it has come to light once more. It was brought by our beloved brother Jesus to the world, his gift to humanity as an instrument of God’s Will.

I beseech you to utilize this gift my beloveds, to utilize the knowledge that you have received. To bring this Truth as something palpable within your lives, within your consciousness, within your spiritual seeking and growth. It is Love. It is the highest Love. It is the most powerful blessing given to mankind. Seek and ye shall find my beloveds. Knock and the door shall be opened and know that you are loved beyond measure, that God’s Love for you is unlimited and the potential to receive His Love has no bounds. It is available whenever you ask and it shall never stop, this gift given in prayer and supplication, shall never be withholden, shall never run dry. These living waters continue to flow.

So I urge you to drink deep my beloveds. Go to the fountainhead of God’s Love and seek what you thirst for which is that deep desire within you to quench this thirst for Love. It is yours, beloveds. It is yours.

God bless you. I am Isaiah of the Bible and an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. And I love you, beloved souls. All children who seek for Truth and recognize the power and the glory of the Love of God are my brethren, my brothers and sisters. God bless you and keep you in this Light. God bless you.
