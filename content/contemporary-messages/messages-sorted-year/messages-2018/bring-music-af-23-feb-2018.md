# Bring Music!

February 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2018

Adria Hotel, Queens, New York, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike.

Â 

Don't take yourselves so seriously, God's work is a work of joy. Do not worry. The souls will respond and they will be drawn by your Light and your laughter and your words and your music of joy. This is a celebration, beloveds, a celebration because you are bringing the salvation of mankind to the world. How long has mankind waited? How long has God waited for this momentous time of change and healing for the world?

You begin a great flood by sprinkling water upon each soul, a flood that shall sweep away all the hurt and pain, all the error and grief. Be joyful, uplift, embrace and speak gently but firmly of the way to the salvation of each and every soul who seeks relief from their pain, upliftment and Truth. It will come through each one of you, my beloveds. It is your destiny to comfort humanity, to speak Truth, to bring Love. I will sing and dance with you, my beloveds. Your friend Goldie is with you and I love you. I love you dearly, my friends on earth, I love you. God bless you. I am with you. God bless you.
