My greetings from spirit to all of you. Our deepest wish is that you receive a great inflowing of the Father’s Love into your souls. For this is the true path to understanding and the awakening of your gifts, your true capacities to serve and to love. Many of you have felt our presence with you, and indeed each has an angel with them. You will be guided, beloved souls, impressed in many ways. Portals of communication will open. You will indeed receive much in this time together, provided that you are able to put aside your material concerns and thoughts, and focus upon the spiritual. For it is in this focus and honing in upon the desires of your soul, that many blessings may come to you, many insights may open to you, and your gifts may indeed be awakened. 

Say your prayers for the inflowing of this blessing of God’s Love. Even if this is unfamiliar to you, say this prayer: *“Gracious God, awaken my soul with your Love. Help me to understand my true self and to understand you. Bring me to that place of light, awareness, joy and deep peace. That the world of your creation, the world of your Love, may be opened to me, and that I may be aware and uplifted and changed in my heart by your Love.”* This prayer, beloved souls, will open many gifts and portals to you upon your journey of awakening. 

We communicate with you, beloved souls, not primarily through your mind but through your soul. This is where you must focus. Release any barriers. Let go of your doubts. Be assured, beloveds, that God will carry you to greater light, that all that you desire in the awakening of your true selves, will be realized by the infusion of God’s Essence into your souls. 

So much awaits each one of you. So many potentials are lying dormant within you, waiting to be awakened. May your eyes be opened. May the true wisdom of your souls come forth into your consciousness, that you may truly know of the wonderment that is you. God will touch each of your souls deeply. God will communicate what you need to understand, so that you may awaken more fully upon this journey. 

You have come together to experience a very blessed time, an opportunity to truly come closer to God and come closer to your true selves. May you be blessed beloved souls, carried upward, removed from the earthly conditions to a place of light and joy, where you may move with ease in the understanding of your spiritual nature and knowings, where God is present with you and this awareness is constant. 

Allow yourself to be uplifted, beloved souls. Seek for the highest. Come to know God and you will never thirst for knowledge, nor will you wonder as to who you are and what lies within you. For with God, the awakening of your soul brings all answers, brings all possibilities, brings you to a place of clarity so that you may be a clear channel of love in this world. God touches your soul at this very moment. Breathe in this blessing.

Come to know the true desires of your soul, that you may find at-onement with God. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls. Your teacher Augustine is with you in this wondrous journey of awakening. God bless you and I love you.
