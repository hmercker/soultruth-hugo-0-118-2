God bless you. Do you sense the eagerness of your friends from far off who wish to be with you in prayer? This opportunity will be but one of many, for as other souls awaken to the possibilities they too will wish to be with you, to draw close in prayer. Many opportunities await, my beloveds. Your life now is dedicated to prayer and to sharing this experience of God’s Love with one another and with many others. So it is important for you to be open and receptive to the opportunities that come your way, to be at peace and to be joyfully inclusive of all. For as you venture forward in this way, God will provide for you the means to do so. To fulfill this purpose is part of His Will, for He desires to gather His children together in prayer. He desires to utilize all of your gifts for one another and as you build this Light amongst you, these bonds of love, these experiences you share, so you will draw in others who will draw in others. The momentum will build, beloved souls, the momentum will build. 

As you continue to grow in this Love, to overcome the obstacles in your way, so your gifts will flourish and open, and be demonstrable to all you meet. Yes, this is part of God’s Plan, my beloveds. These challenges, these opportunities, these expressions of Love, all part of God’s Plan. Allow Him to carry you along in this great river of Love that is rich with guidance and opportunities, Light and Truth.

As you continue to dedicate your lives to this service, so God will use you in many different ways. You will walk many different roads in this world, for this is the fate of each individual who dedicates themselves in the service to God. God sends them forth in service to touch many others. This is His Plan. This is your purpose, your gifts and your opportunities to serve. Allow this awakening and deepening of your service to take place. You feel the excitement within your souls who know you are indeed in harmony with God’s Will. Continue in this way, knowing from deep within you that you are fulfilling the Will of God. The details will come and fall into place as you continue to sound the depths of your souls and bring forth the wisdom within. As this wisdom grows, so your  ability to deal with these complex matters and arrangements will become easier. You will know when to act, to feel the timing, the purposeful effort that will be clear and unambiguous. Again, you are tested. Again, you are given the opportunity to grow. Again, you will find your way as you exercise and expand the abilities of your souls. 

A new day dawns, my beloveds. A new day, an awakening, utilizing different faculties within you, approaching these situations from the perspective of your soul rather than your minds. As you put the perspective of your souls first and then allow your minds to absorb the wisdom and perceptions that come within the soul, then harmony ensues because the faculties of your souls are powerful and know the way to harmony. So you must allow these gifts to flourish within you. You must nourish these gifts with your prayers for the Father’s Love and continue in this wonderful journey to at-onement with God and the awakening of your souls. 

We are pleased with your efforts, beloveds. We continue to work with you in many different ways to bring doors to be opened, opportunities to be exploited, possibilities that will bring new growth, new understandings, deeper awareness, greater Love. So, you continue to step forward, to find your ways, to know your own true selves. You are blessed my beloveds. The Father blesses you all, envelops you in His Love, carries you with His deep care and Love for you. 

Continue to walk within that flow of Light, that beautiful relationship with your soul and His great Soul. So much will come in this. So much comes and will find its way as an expression in your world. God bless you beloveds. I am Seretta Kem and I love you. I love you dearly. God bless you.
