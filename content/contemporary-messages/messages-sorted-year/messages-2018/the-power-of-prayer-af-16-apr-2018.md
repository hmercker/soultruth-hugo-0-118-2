I am your teacher Augustine. The power of Love, my beloveds, the power of Love to change this world - you must focus upon this prayer and desire to seek this Love, to encourage and inspire others to seek the blessing of the Father's Love.

(Baby Emery is present) For the children, the babies, the young and new souls in this world, pour your love upon them. Pray for the Father to bless these children that their souls may be open to the blessing of the Divine Love, for it is in this pursuit of the soul and the awakening of the soul in Love that true change can happen in this world. I know you wonder how you may reach your brothers and sisters, how this Truth may come into the hearts and minds of all in this world. As the many souls in this world continue to seek to be a channel of Love, to know Love, to express Love, to bring the Light of Love within their lives, within their beings, they become a beacon of Light in this world, a beacon, my beloveds, that stretches a great distance and influences many souls.

This you must be. If you truly wish for change, you must seek to be this channel of Love, this beacon of Light in the world and to have the faith that says: *"Yes, dear and beloved Father, You will bring Your Blessings to this world, You will bring Your Love, Your Light to this world. I know that these changes may come because it is Your Will, beloved Father, to bring change to humanity, to bring peace and harmony and joy to this world."*

The power of prayer, beloveds, the power of prayer to bring the blessings to this world and to yourselves. There is nothing within the minds of men that may solve the dilemmas that mankind has created in this world. It is the wisdom of the soul, the wisdom that God may bring to each one of you as you allow your souls to be touched by His Love, to be awakened by the wisdom that comes from the Creator, the Source of all. This is the road you must travel if you truly wish to see change and harmony in this world for it starts with each individual soul who seeks to release the conditions that are not in harmony with Love within themselves and to express this, this Truth in their lives. You may look around you and see great disharmony. Yes, as you continue to open within yourselves with greater sensitivity and awareness, this reality will come more to the fore of your consciousness. It is difficult to see the true condition of humanity, but do not be discouraged, beloved souls. You are making the changes within yourself. You are standing up for Truth by being in the state of grace and knowing the Father's Love and receiving this gift.

You do not realize the impact you have in making this choice and bringing this Light to yourselves. You open a doorway to Light and allow God to make His Presence known in this world. Although you see this as a faint glimmer of hope, it is actually the beginning of a powerful deluge of Light that is coming into this world. It trickles forth but will in time engulf your world and you will be ready, beloved souls, to accept a new way of being in this world, to be in harmony with Love, to act with the wisdom of Love, to teach with the knowings of your souls, to be a channel of Love active, and having impact within this world that will change many. You will see, my beloveds. Do not allow yourselves to feel hopeless or have no power to change what is within this world. Faith can move mountains. Know that the faith within your hearts, the Love within your souls may indeed start to change this world.

You assist in the breaking of the resistance and darkness in this world, creating cracks and fissures where Light may pour in. Indeed, Light will come in ever greater measure as your prayers are heard and the prayers of many others, as your faith grows and your Light increases, as it will in many others. It comes, beloveds. Change is coming. You see that you do have a role, a part to play in this awakening of mankind. May you continue to be in the Father's Love, in the flow of His Love, to receive the great inflow of His Love and its abundance and power to change and heal and bring forth Truth.

You will see these changes in your lifetime, my beloveds. Have faith that you will participate in God's Plan for the salvation of mankind. God carries you, beloved souls, carries you along this path. You will be blessed and protected. You will come to know your true selves and you will come to realize the great abilities and strength that comes with your awakened soul. Have faith, seek the Source always. Be with God always. Many things will come to pass because you have had the faith and the strength within to uphold the Light.

God bless you, my beloveds. Your teacher Augustine, always by your side. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.
