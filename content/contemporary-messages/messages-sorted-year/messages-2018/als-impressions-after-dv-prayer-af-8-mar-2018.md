# Al’s Impressions after DV Prayer

March 8<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Punaluua, Oahu, HI, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike

 

At the beginning of the prayer I saw each of us in a white robe and around the waist was a sash of different colours and that sash had an indication, or was indicative of our role.

So yours was yellow (M) and it indicated bringing forth, bringing through healing and kind of being our guardians for our health and our physical wellbeing. Makes sense with Lotus Blossom as your guide.

And yours was green (J2) and that was bringing elements into the circle for our development. Also indicative of your guide Keea.

Yours (B) was purple and that’s wisdom, perception and wisdom.

And yours (J1) was light blue. You help to bring the connections; you help to keep us together and connected with our souls somehow. I don't know how that works, but your role is to make sure we're all sort of walking together when we're praying. Unity?

Yours was orange (G) and that was strength and there's a kind of physicality to it that helps to develop this direct voice gift.

H's was white with a blue stripe or blue edging. And mine was white with a gold edging and they said that between the two of us we draw in the angels. Somehow we're the ones that provide the energy for them to connect and to be here in close rapport.

I saw that in the beginning and I thought "oh, that's just my imagination," I'm just thinking that up.

Comments by members of group: G - “You couldn’t have made that up.”

I could make it up. But in the end they brought me back to it and they told me specifically and they were making me point, this one, that one, that one, that one. And then my prayer, my silent prayer I said "please help me integrate my mind and my soul, help me to do that" and I had an experience of such clarity and such kind of . . . it felt really stable like it wasn't moving, it was just there, this consciousness of, of my mind and soul together. And it's different and I thought "well, is this what its like for the yogis, this experience when they talk about meditation or something, you know, they talk about this clarity and this whatever. And I don't know whether that's the case or not, but I liked it. It felt strong. It felt . . . I didn't feel vulnerable at all. It just felt like I was within my own self and kind of alert and clear, clear, clarity kept coming, clarity. It felt like I was looking  around and this beautiful white light was all around me and it was just clear, it was just strong and clear and beautiful.

I don't know . . . there were other things that I'm not very . . . I don't know how to describe it and so I'm not going to bother . . . I’d just mess it up so . . . Anyway it was a very powerful experience for me . . . very informative.
