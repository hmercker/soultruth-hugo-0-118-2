My beloved, beloved children, I am your teacher Augustine. 

You know that you have been brought together by God. You see what has transpired in your relationships and your work together. You have experienced many things and though there are those who live far apart, you continue to work together. This work expands and this work continues to function in harmony. And so it will be, all things that are within the realm of God’s Will, will find harmony. Though, in your material world, there are certain demands and requirements in order to function within the laws of the land, in order to be able to communicate and connect with many, the ways and means of doing so are provided, are they not? Has it not been a flow of purposeful and harmonious efforts which you all share and of which many benefit.

You each play a part. You each have a purpose. You each have your gifts. You each contribute with the light in your soul to the entire enterprise. This shall continue. You will continue to find your ways to come together in purposeful work. And you need not speculate, beloved souls, to the point where your minds are confused and your efforts are obscured by material concerns. Solutions will be found and opportunities to serve will always be present. As long as you are connected and in alignment with God, you will find your way. Each of you is quite capable of knowing what must be done. As you continue to grow in your souls, so the guidance will flow, the clarity will be clear, the information will be obvious to your conscious self. 

It is when you get ahead of your guidance and push that there are problems and obstructions to God’s Will. Each of you have learned this lesson to some degree. Understand that God’s timing is most important and that the outcomes of what you do now are not necessarily within your grasp. They are God’s plans, therefore, you must listen and be patient and have faith that all will work as planned. I am not suggesting that you be naïve and ignore the requirements to be able to do this work in a way that is in accordance to the laws and strictures of your country and your world. These things cannot be ignored as you well know. But you need not be obsessed with all things, to have them in order and under control. This is the way of the mind. When you are within God’s timing and the flow of His Will, all things come as they are meant to come. All requirements are met and all harmony is expressed. This is the wonderment of God’s Will and Plan, beloveds. 

There is no need for anxiety. There’s no need to feel put upon, to be pushed and cajoled. These are conditions that you create for yourself, beloveds. When you are in that condition, say a prayer. Ask to be uplifted. Ask for guidance and wisdom, on any matter, and it shall be given, provided that that you are willing to listen and be open to the guidance God has to give you, beloved souls. 

You are not meant to suffer, my friends. You are not meant to be confused, to have a feeling of stress and worry. No. You are meant to be free in the flow of God’s Love. You are meant to have all the support that you require, all that is necessary to bring about the free flowing expression of your work, your ministry in the world. Have faith that this shall be so. That God will provide all the means necessary. That you will benefit from the largesse of many who will support you. For as your light grows, so does your work and as your work grows, so the flow of God’s blessings upon you, even in the material sense, comes. And yes, there are technical details, things to be considered, options and opportunities. Do not overburden yourself with these things. But yes, they may be considered and solutions may be found, in prayer and in focusing upon those things that may cause barriers or requirements that are necessary in order to move forward  as long as you are centered in your soul, beloveds, and not overly concerned with the mental issues that are before you.

It is good to be informed, to know these things that will help you with your work. They will be resolved as all things fall into place with the opening of your soul to God’s Love. Unexpected help, unexpected funds and unexpected opportunities. This is God’s work in play and manifest in your lives. Each of you have seen the manifestations of God’s blessings upon you and to facilitate your work in the world. You must continue to pray for these blessings and that they may be magnified, that you may magnified in love, that all may rise up in the harmonious expressions of God’s blessings upon you all and upon this world. 

There is no lack in your lives, my beloveds. You do not suffer materially. You may not ever feel this sort of suffering and as long as you are within the flow of God’s Will, all will be taken care of beloved souls. All blessings, spiritual, material and soulful will be given. And you are not naïve, you understand what is required in certain situations and you will act accordingly to your own wisdom and knowledge. This is not contravening God’s Will. But within all these things that you do, beloveds, allow it to flow in the harmony and timing of God so that what is meant to fall into place will do so readily and in harmony. 

These are all lessons to be learned, my beloveds. These are all challenges to be met. These are all tests upon your soul that continues to grow and evolve in the light of God’s Love. And some days, you pass these tests, you meet these challenges, you come into harmony, and other days, the challenges seem to overcome and cause you some grief, yet you continue to be in God’s Hands.  You are cradled there and this does not disappear, it continues to grow. You continue to awaken in this glorious journey of life and God intends for you to be of service to many, many souls. You are coming very close, many now come and many more will come. And yes, you must be able to apply your wisdom as to how you will meet the needs of others and also come to know God’s Will and Wisdom in this opportunity of service and love. 

You continue to grow in this wisdom, this ability to know, to act accordingly, to be within this flow that is God’s Will. The clarity will come, beloveds, as will many, many more blessings, many experiences and opportunities to serve, many forms of love, many opportunities to grow within your soul. Much light is shed upon your path. You will walk in this light, beloved souls, protected, provided for, blessed and guided. Allow all these things into your life. Do not let your worries and anxieties of the mind interfere with God’s work. Be in peace, be of good faith, be prayerful and be joyful. All will be well. You have an army of angels at your side, beloveds. How can things not go well when the resources of Heaven and Earth come together in service and love and enacting the Will of God. 

God Bless you my friends. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you, precious souls, precious students. I love you. God bless you.
