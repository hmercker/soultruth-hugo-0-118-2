# Encouragement to teach truth

September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada - Mediumship Retreat Closing

Received by Jesper Sorensen

 

Love your neighbour as yourself. I come forth my children, I am John the Baptist. When I walked the earth I did so with great faith. And my cousin Jesus, he was indeed the Messiah to teach the truth of God in this world and ihe did so. I come on his behalf to send you out into the world to teach these truths. You can do it my friends, there is nothing to be worried about. It takes faith and courage to stand up to these truths for it is a harsh world that you live in. You really can do it. You must believe this for it is true. 

I wish to say you’re all dearly loved, by our Great God. He will send you out into the world each in your own way to fulfill your life’s purpose. Trust in this for I tell you the truth. Life is a great journey. It is to be enjoyed and not so much to be feared. When you have the love of God in your heart it becomes a joyous adventure. You will experience this as you go forth into your path. It is not so hard as your mind may tell you or as that you may believe. It’s like a thing that takes practice, comes slowly with faith. You take one step, you take the next, you take the third. And so it goes. You will experience the joy of walking this path as well. Indeed it is a joyous path.

 I am pleased with all your efforts to bring the love to the world. You have done so greatly in this circle of light, and the love has flowed between you and so it will continue to flow between you. You are greatly loved. And I wish to say thank you to all of you who desire to bring this love to the world. You are the harbingers of truth and the love to mankind.  God bless you.
