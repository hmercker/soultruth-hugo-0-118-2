# Will You Choose to Become a Soul Awakened by God’s Love?

February 24<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Hollis Woods Community Church, Queens, New York, U.S.A.

I am your teacher Augustine. God created this world and then He created mankind. He gave mankind a great gift, a gift of this world. To roam freely over the lands, to do what they would, what their imaginations and their desires told them to do. To live a life within this material world.  And God only said, love one another.  Love each other.  Support one another.  Give your love.

Yet over these millennia upon millennia of existence of mankind in this world, love has not reigned supreme. Instead, the desire for power, control, greed, lust and many aspects displayed by the minds of humanity have brought a terrible condition to this world. And yet, the aspirations of the souls continue to be expressed in love at times, in Light at times, a soul here and a soul there struggling in these conditions of darkness continue to bring Light.  Continue to choose Light.  To pursue harmony and Truth. To pursue God.

How long do you think this world can survive under these conditions, as the presence of mankind multiplies and grows ever stronger and yet does not grow within their hearts, and cannot see beyond their own needs and their own desires?  Humanity stands at a crossroads, a place of choice and you all feel this to some degree. You all sense that these are serious times in your world. Innocence has gone. Love barely is expressed.  And yet, at these times of crisis, of difficulties, great change can take place. Opportunities open, possibilities can be explored. So, as you have done, many are coming together to reinforce Light, to seek fellowship. To band together and bring love. To create what we call a Circle of Light in the world. 

And so, these dear souls have given you some Truth and I suggest that you take away what they have said and contemplate the experiences you have had and consider the possibilities that may now be laid before you, beloved souls. How will you bring Light to this world? What road will you take? How does God fit into this new understanding? Who are you truly, beloved souls? Are you merely the reflective actions that come with the stimulus of this world or are you something deeper? Is there the possibility of greater meaning and impetus, greater gifts and abilities that may come with the awakening of your souls? You have been told of a great key, a powerful instrument that will awaken your souls. It is the Essence of God, the Love of God pouring into you through your beseeching of God to touch your soul, to be in relationship with the Creator. 

Every effort requires a strong foundation.  If you are strong within, strong in love, strong in wisdom and strong in awareness, then you may move forward and serve humanity in beautiful ways. And if you include in your awareness, if you bring an opening to God and allow God a presence within you, you will be guided, you will be given powerful knowledge and direction and Love.  But it is your choice beloved souls, what direction you may walk upon in this world. It is always your choice. God does not interfere with your free will. God honours your existence in this world with Love.  He is open and willing to give to you what you require, but you must ask and seek and pray to release your defenses, your biases and those barriers within you that hold you back from God. 

Oh, how you struggle, beloved souls. How you struggle in this world. You seek not to be vulnerable, not to be hurt, not to be disillusioned and not to look like a fool. You want to be invincible and powerful, revered in this world, respected and acknowledged. And I tell you beloved souls, that these desires come from your minds, not your souls. The soul knows the Love of God and thirsts for the acknowledgement of God and in this, the soul gives Love and does not require that others may acknowledge their Light. This is strength, true strength. And yes, there are times when a soul feels hurt, is pained by the conditions that beset each soul in this world. But God is always there, always there to soothe the soul, to bring His Love, to heal the soul. And soon, the soul trusts in God and faith is formed in prayer.

There is so much available to you, my beloved souls. God has a tremendous gift for each one. Many treasures to be laid upon your feet. Priceless wisdom to be given.  And all that is required is for you to ask, to trust, to lay down those defenses so well maintained and formulated from a life that has taught you that there is much pain, even humiliation in the world. Yet, with God none of these things exist, only Love. The power of Love then becomes the impetus of your life and you begin to understand life from a different perspective and a new strength is borne within, warmed by the flame of Love and a beautiful relationship with your Creator.

Are you willing, beloved souls, to walk in the world in a way that is not the way that most of humanity wishes to live? If you are, then God is there to show you the way. But if you desire the mundane life that humanity has to offer, then you will never know the possibilities which come from the awakened soul. The choice is yours, beloveds. Know that God loves you no matter what choice you make, and God awaits that moment when you are willing to acknowledge His Presence and desire the gift of His Love. 

Every moment is a choice, every moment filled with possibilities. Every footstep may bring you closer to God or further away.  But the world needs those who choose Light, to make a stand and say, I am not willing to continue my life in this way of greyness and darkness. I wish to have a life filled with Love and Light.

So, we come and speak with you. These dear souls come and speak with you to hopefully ignite your imagination, your awareness, so that you may realize there is a choice, that you may come to understand how important is your life and your choices.

May the gift of your life be honoured and expressed in Love and in this, will come many other gifts. God pours His Love upon you at this moment, beloved souls. Strain to feel the Touch of His Love, bring yourself above the human condition. God will lift you up. His angels will support you. May you continue to strive for the highest, the brightest, the most beautiful, of Love. You will be blessed beloved souls, beyond your imaginings. It does not require anything more than your effort. It is a gift freely given by God. 

God bless you beloveds. I am your teacher Augustine and I thank you for listening to what I have to say. May you grow beloved souls, in Light. That is my fervent prayer, that you grow in Light and Love. God bless you. God bless you.
