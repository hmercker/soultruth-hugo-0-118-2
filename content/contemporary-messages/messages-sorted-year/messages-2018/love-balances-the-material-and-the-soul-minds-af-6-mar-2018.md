Â 

God bless you, beloveds, this is Confucius. How pleased are the angels that you wish to be with them in prayer, to continue to uphold this condition of Light amongst you and to focus your conversations together on spiritual matters. You have truly heard us in our desires and ways of urging you on to higher thoughts and aspirations. Please continue in these efforts and expressions of your true selves and those meaningful thoughts regarding your experiences and your postulations regarding the Truth of God's Creation.

With these conversations you encourage the upwelling of the wisdom of your souls. With these prayers you help to make that channel of information between these two aspects of yourself clearer and more direct in their expressions. You begin to bring these two parts, the mind of the material and the mind of the soul together. As you aspire for higher things, to continue to grow in the Father's Love, these parts of yourself will balance. It will come. You guard against being distracted and being diverted in your thoughts by coming together in Love and expressing Love with one another. I urge you forward, beloved souls. I see some maturity coming forth in you, and wisdom.

God bless you, beloved souls. You are no longer the babes in arms. You begin to grow up and find your rightful place as true channels of the Father's Love and Truth. Continue, beloved souls, and claim your place with God. God bless you. God's Love is with you. I am Confucius.
