Â 

I attended your healing and added many blessings to the blessings that the dear soul (Pauline<sup>1</sup>) gave to each of you. You see there are many avenues that we may use to bring forth specific blessings and benefits to your physical bodies and to also bless those who are working with humanity in their efforts to heal and uplift. Know that wherever you go, we continue our work and take these opportunities seriously to assist yourselves and assist many others. 

Yes this instrument is undergoing a cleansing of the body and must abide by the needs of the body to rest and cleanse. And you my son, have received a deep healing as well, one that may extend your life. Our intention is for each of you to be of good health and strength that you may continue to work on behalf of the Father and His Love and Truth. And indeed there are laws to be abided by and efforts and decisions to be made that will benefit your physical health. This cannot be avoided, beloved souls. It must be acknowledged, not as the primary motivation of your search and efforts in life, but as a complement to your spiritual growth and work. 

And we are all too eager to guide you in this regard and to assist you. You must be open and willing to listen. For you know within you what is right, what is in harmony, what must be done to honor your body, to honor the condition of your light, and to honor God. Recognize your own responsibilities beloved souls, and acknowledge the possibilities that are inherent with each day, each moment.

Always bring love into your day and in whatever you do allow love to flow. Allow love to break any barriers or obstructions, disharmonies, physical pain, difficulties within the mind and pain within the soul. God may bless you with many things, beloveds. It is for you to avail yourself of these blessings for God can do nothing unless you are open and willing. You have a deep desire for healing, for change, for harmony and for love. Be aware, beloved souls, of your motivations and those habits of the mind that trip you up in your daily life and make concerted efforts to change these patterns and walk in greater harmony and be an expression of love Be a channel of love in your life to all you meet, to wherever you are, whatever you do, and allow God to uplift you and guide you and bring you into the great light that He intends to envelope you with so that every soul, every cell of your being, every part of everyone in this world may know this light. The power of which can change the world and bring greater harmony to all. 

Great love and blessings to you my sons, my precious sons, who make effort to walk in light and know that I and many are with you, walk with you, and desire that we may have a greater rapport, that we may come close, that this work that awaits us all may indeed come to be. God continues to bless you, beloveds. God continues to encourage and uplift and bring awakenings within your souls so that you may be equipped to be in this world as an agent of change, as a beautiful channel of love, that you may bring wisdom and truth wherever you go. 

God bless you my beloved, beloved brothers. My love is with you. Healing light upon you. Peace be with you, beloveds.
