God bless you, I am Mark. I have come to say to you that God will lay many opportunities at your feet to serve Him in Love, to be a channel of Love in this world. As your souls continue to be nurtured by this holiest of blessings, so the flow deepens, the gifts and abilities within you are strengthened and awakened by this gift of Love.

There are many souls in this world who long for what you have, my beloveds, yet know not how to receive and find their way to the Light of God. Many souls are in a state of deprivation and they cannot feel Love, cannot see beyond their narrow perspective of the mind. Yet within their soul is a longing, a desire for relief from their loneliness, for Truth, for their spiritual quest, for a sense of self that goes beyond the superficial, the mindful ideas and acknowledgement that comes from other sources. You must bring the succor that they seek, beloved souls. Be a channel of God's Love. Be a purveyor of Truth. Walk in the Light and show the way to those who hunger and thirst, lost and lonely, confused and angry. There are so many in your world, beloved souls, so many.

God will open the doors for you to serve in many ways, to express the multiplicity of the gifts that you have within your souls and to bring these gifts and these abilities to fruition so that when you walk in the world, you will walk with strength, with wisdom, with Truth and with Love, being a true Light for God. So you feel the awakening within, beloved souls. You know that God has touched you, continues to touch you and awaken you. Every day is an opportunity to serve in Love, to be a Light. The blessing of the Father's Divine Love intensifies and brings a great transformation of these gifts within. Add this Love to whatever you do, my beloved souls, wherever you are, however you may express yourselves in the world. Add this Love, seek it and seek it often. Bring your prayers to God each and every day until your prayers come with every breath and every footstep and in every place you are in your life may these blessings be expressed. As you receive, so you will give to others and as you know and come to know God, so this expression will be evident with your presence, your Light. It will come reflexively, a flow so easily released because you are in alignment with God, that channel built, that connection forged between you and your Heavenly Father. Do not restrict the flow of Love in your life. 

Do not set parameters and expectations of what it is you are meant to do as an instrument of Light in the world. Allow God to guide you, to show you the road of service, of spiritual growth and of soul awakening. In this way you need not be overly mindful of the expressions of your soul, but merely to allow and to feel a deep gratitude that God is with you. And God will use you in life to reach many souls in ways unexpected, in ways often unrecognized but will flow nonetheless, in your service, in your countenance and expression of Love.

Walk in this Love and you walk upon a path of joy, of profound experiences, of unexpected delights, for God has much to give each one of you as long as you are receptive and desire to be in this relationship with your Heavenly Father. Whatever you may wish to call God and to see God, it is merely the recognition of your minds and the acknowledgement of your souls that will bring about these wondrous blessings from above. With this comes the presence of His angels, the beautiful bright souls of Love who are eager to serve, to accompany you upon this journey and to bring you to your soul's awakening and to guide you along in your understanding and in your perceptions of this Truth. God gifts you with everything, my beloved souls, everything you require to awaken in Love.

May your souls shine forth, beloveds. May you be a clear channel of His Love. May you accept this invitation from God to be in deep communion, in relationship with the Source of all. In this all will come, all will come in time, the openings of the faculties of your soul, the gifts that lay within it, and you will experience a joyous life, a life rich in Love, a life of great joy and peace. Is there anyone here who would not desire this? No, each soul here wishes for something higher, in deeper relationship with Truth and Love and God. I say to you, now is the time, now is the time to drink of these blessed waters of Love. Nourish your souls, quench your thirst and bare the waters to help others drink.

May your beautiful souls walk this earth in Light, in humility and grace, and be His channels of Love. He invites you upon this journey. He sees your Light. He sees you for all that you are. He does not judge your flaws, but He wishes to give to you what you require to release those conditions within that inhibit the pristine beauty of your soul. Seek this Touch and this healing and this grace and you will be liberated from the dark conditions of this world and know a journey of Light.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Mark. I am close to your church, beloved souls. I am close and look over this place of Light, this centre of Light. I am so happy to see you create a circle of Light here amongst you that you will be able to bring with you when you return to your homes. A measure of strength and insight and peace and Love to help you upon your journeys and your work, what you continue to express in this beautiful centre of Light, your church. Where God smiles upon you, beloveds, in your efforts to bring greater harmony in the world, to bring Love and support to those who walk through your doors. You are blessed. You shall continue to be blessed and you shall see in greater measure, in deeper understanding that comes from your soul blessed with Love.

God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. I walk with you. I am your servant in Love. God bless you. I am Mark and I love you all. God bless you.
