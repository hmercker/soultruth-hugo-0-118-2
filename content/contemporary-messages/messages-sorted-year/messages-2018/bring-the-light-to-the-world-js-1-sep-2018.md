I say this is a beautiful circle. The beautiful light that has been generated here and that you have all done so well in building the light which is being used in the world for the betterment of humanity. You are all precious souls and you are feeling the Light and the bonds grow. There is no better truth than this Light, this Love and you have been chosen to bring this to the world.

Loving one another is all that we need to do in this world for the world to blossom, for the darkness to be shed. Love is the key to all life, and the truth of your souls. Just trust and believe in this Love and you will go far in this world, in light, in being an instrument for God. You are all beautiful. We in spirit love you very much. You all are watched over. You are all blessed. You must believe this for this is the key to confidence, to unlocking those gifts within you, to have that faith to speak up when it’s needed regardless of what the others may think. 

It is a leap of faith to walk in this Light, in this Love. Your souls will come to the forefront before your minds and you must not be afraid of this, when you have the urge to speak, to share something with people you may not even know, just trust in this inspiration that you might get in your hearts and don’t be afraid to follow the inspiration. This is often so that we get afraid to say, to speak something. We don’t know how the other people will respond but as this light grows within you, you will know that you are being inspired to say something so it is just about taking that faith and say it. This will benefit you - you will grow in love and faith and it will benefit the person you are standing before. 

It really is about getting the mind out of the way and just feel your heart centre and your soul and believe in its guidance. You all can do this now. You have the light, you have the feeling of your soul. No matter what your mind may tell you about it you must not listen to that but drop into your heart space and believe in that instead. As you do this, as you begin to follow this heart space you build your confidence in yourself at a soul level. It might feel awkward at first but this is what is needed to follow that inner touch that inner guidance no matter how silly you might think it is through your mind’s experience. Your mind will always judge you but you must not listen to that. You must step forward and go forward with the inspiration that you feel you receive on a soul level. And this is really all that is needed that you come to trust in your inner being and follow its guidance.

I am delighted to come here amongst you and you are all blessed. Step forward my friends into the world. Don’t be afraid to show your light. This is what is needed and it will touch other people. Thank you.
