My beloved souls, I am Confucius. You are precious souls, each one precious, a pearl beyond price, a beautiful Light in this world. The lost soul seeks and casts about for the Light but knows not where to go. But the wise soul comes to God, comes to Light from that inner voice that draws them to those places where they may commune with God and know their souls in Love.

You are all wise, my beloveds. You have come together with a singleness of purpose to open your souls to the inflowing of the Father's Love, this great and mighty Essence, the highest of all blessings to be bestowed upon humanity and all souls of God's Creation. You are all blessed in this Light and Holy Presence that is the Hand of God upon you. You are all beautiful for you have a soul that yearns for Light and Truth and you give Love to your brothers and sisters. You are all strong because you have not succumbed to the darkness of this world but you seek Light.

Beloved souls, continue to grow and expand in Love, in Truth, in wisdom, in strength, in purity and beauty. Your lives will reflect this and your lives will be filled with expressions of Love. You are blessed, beloved souls, blessed by God. Feel this touch within your hearts. Open yourselves to the mighty inflowing of His Essence, uplifting and healing and bringing deep peace and true knowledge as your souls hunger and thirst for the living waters of God. May you drink deep, beloved souls, and know that you are indeed walking a path of Light and shall find all that you seek. It shall be yours, for God blesses with abundance and brings all that is required to fill you with knowledge and Love, peace and joy. It is yours for the asking, beloved souls, yours for the asking.

God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. Confucius loves you. Confucius is with you. God bless you, beloved souls of this world.
