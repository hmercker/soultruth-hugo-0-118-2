Â 

God pours His blessings upon you, my beloveds. God seeks to touch every soul in your world and that every soul may open to the touch of God so that His Love may pour upon each one of you no matter the religion, the doctrines and creeds, the races and cultures of this world. Every soul is loved. Every soul is precious in the eyes of God.

You seek to bring Light to this world, my beloveds, and to embrace all in Love. Please continue in your desires and your efforts to serve mankind, to serve humanity in Love. In this God will touch your efforts, the blessings will flow and you will be inspired to bring healing and upliftment to those who are in need. Seek the Touch of God to empower your touch to others, my beloveds. Seek to know God and you shall be a channel of Love. To empower others, you must empower yourselves and to do this most effectively, you must seek the source of all power and Love and Light. It is in this simple prayer and longing heart that all flows and all comes with the aspirations of your soul, the desires of your minds which may open doors to bring real possibilities of service to mankind. It comes with a simple prayer. It comes with a longing. It comes with an open and willing heart to bring Love to humanity.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am Matthew. I feel love for each one who travels their unique path to bring healing to the children, to all the peoples in this world. God blesses the healers, the ones who seek Truth, the ones who wish that Love may reign in this world. This is God's work. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you in your work.
