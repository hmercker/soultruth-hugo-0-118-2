# An Old Friend Supports Us in Prayer

October 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

 

Greetings from the world of spirit. I am Elsie.<sup>1</sup> And yes you have been feeling me close to you, lately. I have been very close. Making up for lost time as they say. I do regret the time I have lost being close to my dear friends, my beautiful friends, who are so dedicated to this life of God and His Love. 

I want you to know that since passing into spirit, I have progressed greatly. It did not take much time for me to release my erroneous beliefs. Now I am gloriously happy. I reside in the seventh and I’m close to my beloved Alec. I am close to you, all of you, who continue to strive to open your souls to God’s Love and be in this light so beautiful. I am so happy for you both and for all of you. In this place of light and service and dedication to love, know that I, too, am praying for you. I, too, am part of this vigil and it is my privilege, my blessing, to be with you. You will know me. I am close. I love you. I will not leave you again my beloved Jeanne. I’m closer than you can think and love you more than you know. 

My beloved friends, thank you for carrying on this Truth that James Padgett brought and that Jesus taught. It is so important, so very important. I’m happy to see my beloved Albert continuing with the work of mediumship. This is important as well. There is so much work to do my friends, so much we can all do to further the Truth of God’s Love. You have my support and the support of many, many, angels, thousands of angels who are supporting you and all those in this world of yours who are bringing the Love of God in their lives, in their hearts, in their work. So much is needed and all of you who are willing will know a great reward, a beautiful blessing within their souls. God uplifts His children. God loves His children. And God will never forsake His children. God has never forsaken me. He was always there. His Love continued to fill my soul. I never stopped praying for His Love and I continue to progress in the world of spirit. I’m close to entering into the Celestial Realms. My joy, my joy is so deep. My happiness so great. My love grows and grows. My love for you all will continue to be with you and I will help to assist you in your work. 
God bless you. Your friend Elly is with you and I love you so. God bless you.

Elsie Grosart, affectionally known as “Elly” hosted Alec Gaunt and his Direct Voice Development circles in her apartment at 13<sup>th</sup> and Granville Streets from 1958 to 1970 in Vancouver, B.C. Canada.  Elly, who preferred anonymity, worked as a bank teller for the Bank of Montreal.  She was the main medium used to channel messages from Celestial Angels during these development circles.  A collection of messages received during this period can be found [here - a pdf download.](/media/Direct_Voice_Volume_1_Revision_1_5.pdf)

Elly’s apartment, a modest ground floor suite in the fashionable South Granville area of Vancouver, could be completely blackened during the circles and contained a cabinet for Alec to sit in for development using ectoplasm.  A trumpet was used to channel some messages.  Alec and Elly discovered they were soul mates but never married.  Sadly, Alec passed away prematurely in Elly’s apartment in February, 1970. The loss of his strong and disciplined leadership left a significant gap and the many circles Alec and Elly hosted in Elly’s apartment soon disbanded.  

After Alec’s untimely death, Elly was guided to meet and mentor 20 year old Jeanne Dunbar - they met at the Bank of Montreal where they both worked in customer service.  Elly introduced Jeanne to Al Fike in 1975 after re-connecting with Barbara Davies who was mentoring Al as a 22 year old.  Barbara began hosting Divine Love prayer circles in her West Vancouver home which carry on until today – June, 2020.  Jeanne and Al were married in Stanley Park, Vancouver in 1976. Elly married Larry Taunton and moved to San Diego in 1982 and was sorely missed by the Vancouver group. Elly was an extraordinary Divine Love medium and left a great legacy in the Vancouver area.
