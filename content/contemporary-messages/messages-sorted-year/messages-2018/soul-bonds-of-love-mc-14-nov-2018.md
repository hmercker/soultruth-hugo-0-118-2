# Soul Bonds of Love

November 14<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Abbotsford, B.C. Canada

Received by Maureen Cardoso

 

Beloved souls I am Seretta Kem. You know the bonds of love, the bonds that God’s Love creates. Many of you are in simultaneous prayer as we come together, and I see the dear soul has arrived safely, greeted by his two friends across the waters.<sup>1</sup> How quickly you come together, tuning in, celebrating in a prayer. You see how well established your bonds are, your soul bonds, no matter where you are for you are all scattered about your planet Earth at this time. Yet your souls yearn to be in prayer together, reaching for God’s Love, to be blessed by these living waters nourishing your souls, replenishing your bodies and bringing peace to your minds. I say to my three friends who are gathered together at this time, your union is important for one another. The support you give to one another, the understanding that you have between you at this time where you desire to be used by God, attending the occasion for sharing these truths with the dear souls who will arrive. Everything is orchestrated and all you must do is be in the Light of God’s Love, being an example of these truths and sharing from your own experiences.

A sense of peace and love with a good condition will be present while you gather together. There will be many times of prayer, laughter and celebratory joy. We in spirit will come and speak and guide as your prayers continue. It is a great joy once again as we say this often, to witness your soul awakenings. Each of you has settled into your daily routines since you are all last together. You are all feeling the shifts, the benefits and the changes from your intense time in prayer. This will continue, some experiences more profound than others, but all very important as you recognize this new way that exists within you, this deeper connection with your beloved Creator, how you are more attuned to your soul’s promptings and your ability to discern soul perceptions. There is much that occurred in this intense time together. Continue to be in prayer close to your heavenly Father. As things continue to settle within you and become a more recognized part of you, these many changes and these new ways will become a stabilized part of who you are.

Our love remains with you and as you join in prayer, we also join you for our bonds are strong, our golden linked ring very strong, eternal bonds of love, soulful love. 

God bless you my friends. I am Seretta Kem and my love is with you. God bless you.
