# Love is the Great Truth

August 28<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada – Mediumship Retreat

Received by Jesper

 

I wish to say that it is wonderful to be here amongst you and be in this Circle of Light. The light is building very strongly here now in this circle. I wish to say that everything is well and as it should be. No need for any worries. We are trying to bond with every one of you and work with you in a way that we can, the best possible way. I want to say that my love is the great gift of the Father and that you must just trust it and allow it to flow into your souls. That way it can come in in great abundance and change you and help you to achieve the things that you must achieve.  

Love is the great Truth of the universe, which we wish to bring to mankind. Everybody on earth must know about this Love. It is of paramount importance that it be given, that everyone can find their way to God. Love is the great gift of life and this love amplifies the love that you were created with, so that it may heal your wounds, discover your true self, and be healed from all that ails you.  

I wish to say one more thing and that is that life is love. In this circle let the love flow in between you, bonds are deepening and we are so happy to experience this and see this from our side of life that it makes our hearts sing. We are touched by your efforts and excited at the results that will flow. Thank you for allowing me to speak.
