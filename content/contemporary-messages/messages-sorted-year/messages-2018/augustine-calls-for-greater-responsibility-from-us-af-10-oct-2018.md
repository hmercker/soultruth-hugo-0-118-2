God bless you, I am Augustine, your teacher. I wish to assure you that there has been no deception on our part. If you were to go through the chronicles of messages and words that we have spoken to you and piece them together into the narrative of our continued efforts together, you will see that each step was necessary. Each change of the program came about for particular reasons. You see, my beloveds, you live on the Earth plane. This is a very volatile condition in which we work and you work. Your personal condition, spiritual condition, fluctuates from one day to the next. Your thoughts, your intentions may be quite different one day to the next. We cannot control this. We do not control you. Each of you has the gift of free will. Each of you chooses, whether you are aware of it or not, how you will be on a particular day in terms of your spiritual condition and your desires. 

Most of the volatility comes from your minds, my beloveds. Your minds continue to be unruly and undisciplined. You choose to ignore certain issues and expressions and thoughts that are counter-productive to this work. You wish to express yourselves freely and you certainly do so. We do not correct you, beloveds. We do not say, this is wrong or that this is inconsistent or unloving. No. We will never, ever take these actions. We love you. We are here to love you and to nurture you, to uplift and support you. But you cannot blame us, beloveds, when you have some experience in your circles or during your day or during a series of days that does not meet your expectations. These are the results of your choices. You are empowered to make choices, to choose the condition in which you are in, which you bring into the circle, which you share amongst yourselves. We are powerless to change this unless you ask for help, unless you pray to be uplifted, unless you make a concerted effort to be in the condition that is requested of you, that you know is necessary in order to be in that light and love, harmony and receptivity that is required. 

I admonish you, my children, for I do not wish for you to be children any longer. I wish for you to take responsibility for your actions, your thoughts, your conditions, your judgments. All these things, which is so commonly foisted upon others rather than looking within yourself and acknowledging that the condition and patterns of your mind often create difficulties and hold you back from light. You are all well aware of this. You are all struggling, I know. 

We are not angry or even perturbed. For we know well the conditions that we are dealing with, with those of you on the Earth plane, and yet we persist. We continue with this work in love and we hope that with each day, you will make an effort to be uplifted and loving, joyful, free of these thoughts and conditions that inhibit you from this beautiful gathering so that there may be harmony and peace amongst you. Consider your words, my beloveds, consider your thoughts, consider what love is and how to express love. And I know that you do, that you try, you make great efforts. At times, you fall down.

But you are willing to pick yourselves up and we are willing to give you a hand. But life on this Earth is not consistent. It is not dependable in terms of outcomes. We can only give you our time and dedication. But we cannot guarantee that the outcomes that you may expect are possible. With God’s Love, anything is possible, but you must make the effort to receive, nurture, express and allow the power of God’s Love to infiltrate all of you, all of your thoughts, all of your interactions, all of your choices.

So we patiently wait. You are not being spoon-fed any more, beloved souls, for that time is finished. You continue to grow and strengthen. You are mature enough now to know the choices that are ahead of you, the responsibilities and the challenges. Patience, beloveds, patience is important. Knowing that in time all will unfold as it should. In time you will find your way and express these many gifts which we have been talking about. 

Beloved souls, know that all the resources of Heaven are at your disposal. All good things, all light, prayers, blessings are given freely. But it is the nature of humanity to ignore, to trample, to twist, to take for granted, to be judgmental though God gives so much. So I ask you my friends, beloved children, consider your attitudes and your thoughts, consider your judgments and your pain. Consider all those things that stand in your way to be in harmony with God, with one another, with this great purpose that we are set upon. 

You will see that there is no blame set on any individual, whether they be mortal or angelic. It is the circumstances in which we are all dealing and living with in this great venture. There are inconsistencies. There are trials and tribulations. There are barriers and misunderstandings. These things are a part of your life. I would suggest that you accept that each day will bring its treasures and rewards and its challenges. 

Be grateful, beloveds, for what is laid before you. Grasp and embrace in joyous recognition of the great gift that is given to you. In this joy, all those flaws and things that are difficult for you to accept, melt away in love and appreciation of life. There is no perfection, beloveds. There is only harmony, when harmony is pursued. There is peace when there is harmony. There is joy where there is love. There is wisdom, deep knowings of the soul, when you are aligned with God. There is a deep patience allowing God’s Will to manifest in its good time, in its good ways. 

Beloveds, my love is with you and I understand. I too was impatient when I walked the Earth. I too was judgmental. So we do not judge, we merely inform, give the guidance as best we can and our perceptions of the truth. Through this instrument and to you individually, we speak to you, we speak to you. 
May you listen with ears of your soul and know with the wisdom of your soul that although you continue to struggle in this world, you make great headway. You continue to grow within your souls and to work together. Beloveds, we are with you every moment and God is with you always. 

You will find fulfillment in your efforts, beloveds, and that fulfillment will be of the soul. It may not be manifest as you anticipate, but it will indeed manifest as God wills. This is humility, to accept God’s plan for the salvation of mankind that you may find your part therein, and not dictate as to what that might be. Be patient, my beloveds. Much is coming, many surprises, beautiful insights and experiences of love, much is coming.

God bless you, beloveds. Your teacher Augustine continues to be with you by your side as you struggle and grow, emerge from the constrictions of this Earth plane to something far greater, more beautiful. This continues. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
