I am Jesus. I come to bless you and to tell you how much I love you and to recognize your strength and commitment to bringing the Truth of the Father's Love to this world. You continue to abide by God's Will, His desire to use you as His instruments for peace and change and Love in this world.

You are blessed, beloved souls, truly blessed and your light shines in this world. Do not allow the conditions of this world to influence your thinking, that you are ineffective, that you do not make a difference and bring Light, for you do. You cannot see the far-reaching effects of your work. But I tell you, beloved souls, it is the strength and love and faith of those like yourselves that brings hope to this world and the possibilities of change that will bring Light. Continue to be of good faith, to be strong in Light, to be consistent in your prayers, and to walk together hand in hand in this work that God has blessed you to do in this world.

You come close to your soul's purpose, my beloveds, you come close to the realization of your true selves, the awakening of your souls. You come close, beloveds, and the Father's Joy and Love shines upon you and He blesses you mightily. Continue to walk in the Light, to be humble and to be clear in your intentions and desires to serve and you will know God's Plan in your life. It will be enacted as it is intended. Be at peace, my beloveds. Walk in faith, know the true longings of your souls and let go of all that is not in harmony with Love.

I am with you and I love you. God bless you, beloveds. You are dear to my heart, precious, precious in this world. God bless you.
