# Compassion For Self and Others During Soul Awakening

My dears, please do not be hard on yourselves. Our beloved Augustine gave [a great teaching message](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2018/augustine-calls-for-greater-responsibility-from-us-af-10-oct-2018/) and brought clarity that was required. It is the human nature to fall back somewhat, to reprimand themselves to some degree. His guidance is given where perhaps you feel that you have fallen short but this is certainly not the reason for the guidance and the teachings. It is purely out of love and that which we see you are ready to walk with and to grow in, to live and come to teach others. 

You are all excellent students, taking to heart the guidance that is brought forward. Your conversations are necessary, beloveds. They help to bring forward the uncertainties, perhaps confusions, so that we can come forward and clarify and guide. Your journey of the soul, awakening the soul more greatly, is an eternal journey. So be sure to be compassionate with yourselves and with others. 

As your soul expands and strengthens and becomes this greater conscious part of you, there will still be things to release and align. These patterns have been with you and have served you to some degree for many years. It is not possible to release everything in one go. Your incremental growth and this pace is important, for as the dear soul desires to be alert and to be attentive, as you all do, this is how one can be alert and attentive via this incremental growth. 

So we still are very, very pleased and overjoyed with how we see you taking very seriously this time together, becoming more and more aware of your soul and befriending this part of you and allowing it to be your greater expression. It is an ebb and flow of your ability to have your consciousness upon your soul. It is important when you feel that you are out of that flow, to re-connect it to your soul, to hold compassion for yourself. 

For my dears, you always, always will return to that space within you. As this continues to strengthen, you find that there is more time where you have this consciousness of your soul’s desire. Your soul mind is awakening and informing your material mind. Allow this flow to happen. Be a witness to this part of you, noticing in a soft and gentle way where you are coming from at any given time. Your expressions, your thoughts, and your actions - is this strictly of my material mind? Is my soul mind involved here? This is your interior work, that which is necessary. For as you are able to observe this, you grow in your discipline. Noticing when you are operating fully from your material mind, this is a good point to allow your soul or to invite the response from your soul. It will be a back and forth for some time yet. Again, this is strictly part of the growth, the awakening of your true selves. 

The love that you have for one another is so evident. Holding space for one another is important. To hold space, beloveds, means to simply allow the individual to express what is happening within them. It is not so much to give instruction or bring forth your point of view, as each of you hold the answers within you. You have the source of God to turn to, the wisdom of your souls. Holding space provides the individual to verbalize, releasing it on another level from themselves. For they can then hear themselves, exteriorly rather than only in their mind. This is an important part of one’s discovery as well. So when you find one another in need of expression of something that is occurring within them, hold space in love. Send them love. Allow your love to flow through to them and be a nurturing channel, witnessing their release. 

I thank you for your alertness and attentiveness in this very moment, for I feel you all listening with the ears of your soul. God bless each of you. My love remains with each of you. May you be in joy on the path of awakening your souls. God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you. My love is with you. God bless you.
