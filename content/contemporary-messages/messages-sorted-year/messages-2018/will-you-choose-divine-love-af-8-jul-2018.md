I am Augustine, a teacher, and I reside in the Celestial Heavens. The light that you feel here amongst you in this circle is not a common experience of humanity. In fact few know how to draw this light to them. Yet this light is available to every soul in your world. Every soul may experience the deep Touch of God, may have their souls blessed with His Love and may know the deep joy that comes with this blessing. 

Beloved souls, you have been drawn here and your souls have guided you to this place at this time to be together, to share with one another, to walk a few hours together. While you have been talking and sharing, God is blessing you. God pours His Light upon you and you are receiving the benefits of these blessings. As these dear children have expressed, it is for you to uncover this great secret, this great blessing, to receive the Divine Essence within your soul, awakening all the gifts and faculties of your soul. These things are different from your mind. They are aspects and gifts that God has given you from His own Soul and they may be expressed in light and beauty, so that you may walk in this world with eyes open, with knowings deep, with a surety and comfort that comes with having God in your awareness and close to your being, your soul. Every soul has a choice to seek light or not. Every choice has its consequence.

Each of you, beloved souls, seeks light. You sense within you possibilities that will ignite the potentials of service to humanity and I wish to encourage you, beloveds, to build a proper foundation within you, a foundation that will bring you close to God, to bring you in harmony with God’s Laws of Creation. This can be done either with the purification of your being and the love that is within you that God has blessed you with, with life, or you may travel the road of soul transformation through Divine Love. This choice is yours and it is a choice that every soul has and will come to make at some time in their existence.  But I would encourage you to do so at this time in your life.  For it is easier for a soul to progress in this earth plane than one that has not progressed at all and has come to a place of darkness in spirit. In that condition, it will take a very long time for that soul to work its way from darkness to light, from error to truth. Use your time wisely, beloved souls. Seek for the highest. Walk a path of light. Be honest and forthright in your endeavours to purify yourselves to be in greater harmony and love. For with this foundation, you will be a powerful channel of light for others. You will walk this world guided in the light. You will be able to touch many in this way. With the inflowing of the Love of God, you will know the Will of God. In knowing His Will, the highest outcomes, the greatest light, the most beautiful expressions of service will be yours. 

May you find and come to know the longings of your souls, and be inspired thus, to greater good, to deep healing, to wondrous joy, and peace beyond measure. It yours for the asking, beloved souls. God answers all sincere prayers. With the prayer for His blessing of Divine Love, God will assign you an angel who will accompany you upon your journey. You may have many angels with you depending on what you choose, what your journey entails, how you serve. God bless you beloved souls and keep you in His Light and Love. We are with you. You are never alone. Draw us close and you will know us. Draw God close and you will know the universe. God bless you beloveds, I am Augustine and I love you. God bless you.
