# A Soul Yearning for Divine Love Brings Celestial Support

It is your friend Alec. So good to listen to you share, my dear son, your journey and being close with spirit, sharing the way to draw close the celestials - the guidance, the influence and the presence. I so remember being with you and your mate on those days you spoke of experiencing the harmony, being in alignment with the Will of God and then experiencing quite the opposite. 

My friends what is first and foremost important in connecting with us of the celestial realms is your yearning for Divine Love. For a soul that desires to be close to God, to draw in the Essence of the Creator, for that soul to be cleansed and awakened and nurtured by the highest gift which is the gift of Divine Love, this draws us to you. We are like the helpers, the servants, the agents of God, helping those on earth walk in the light and achieve their destiny as put before them. So please remember this important time with your beloved Creator to develop this beautiful soul connection with the One who has created you. 

Come to know your souls, beloveds. For in that it makes it possible for us in the celestial realms to support your journey, your discovery, your discovery of what is Divine Love, the ability to tangibly feel your soul awakening over time. We are there to serve you. Yes there is spirit always around. The plane that you live on is filled with many levels of spirit in different conditions. So as you make your efforts in developing your soul and awakening your soul in Divine Love, there will come a time for those who are new to us on the celestial realms, there will come a time where you may be able to hear a word, feel a presence and notice our influence. You may ask for our presence to help you, to uplift you. Some of you know who guides you. Some have had the same guides for a very long time and have developed a close rapport, a soul rapport, with their guide. Some are coming to know their guides or have recently been introduced to one of the celestial angels that is there to guide them. For we have a keen interest in your support. You can call on us to walk with you in your day. It does require your thoughts to be on a higher level but when they are not, my dear friends call out to God asking, yearning, longing for that help. For it is in your call to God, He sends us in your response. It is not a difficult task. It is not methodical. It is more about feeling. Walking with the essence of your heart's desire, your soul's desire, this is what more readily draws us. 

You each have the capacity to create a loving bond with your celestial friends. It does take your effort and it does take your time. My suggestion would be as you continue to strengthen your ability to read things of a spiritual nature on Divine Love, come to understand what this Essence, what this Love of God, can do. There have been many, many extraordinary messages given by us in spirit.  Nourish your mind with these beautiful truths, imbue your souls with this beautiful Love and allow the energy of this Love to do its work. Allow it to cleanse and allow it to lift off those conditions that keep you from God. As the dear soul shared in his talk, it is necessary for these conditions to be lifted off and as they are, your soul does expand. There is a greater brightness, a space in you where your light is expansive. This is necessary for your soul awakening and drawing near to you your devoted guides. Have support around you and come together with like-minded souls to nurture your curiosity, answer your questions as best they can and to pray together. It is like exercising a muscle you need to develop, this art of yearning to be close to God and to have God touch your soul. As this is strengthened your desire to be close to God will be in the forefront of your thought. You will have the ability to commune with God, to bring God into everything. Here again we can come and guide and influence, help you with your gifts. 

Desire does play a part. When a soul desires to walk with celestial angels by their side, we can come. If there is no desire or reaching out, it limits our contacting you. He has touched on in his talk about the mental diet, this also is very important. For when your mental diet is on loving things, on seeking for solutions, on yearning for God’s help, we can easily come close to you. 

You feel our presence when you pray together in circle. You can also strengthen the rapport as you pray individually on your own. It may feel less in the beginning, but by strengthening this muscle, making your effort, you will draw us near. Allow your soul to grow in God’s Love. Do not worry about the way in which we will communicate with you. Allow things to unfold and know the hand of God is upon you, taking care of you. We all look forward to having a rapport with you and as the dear soul mentioned earlier in the week, there are many unemployed celestials. They are there to serve you, my friends. So I hope this helps you in your discovery and how to more deeply connect with us in spirit. I hope I have been able to share with you some simple ways. 

I wish to commend the dear soul who has listened to his guidance and his mate has listened to her guidance for being open to bringing all of us together. You are both deeply loved and are serving your purpose. May you all be so blessed to know God so closely that you can discern your purpose. Each day though, one serves a purpose to love themselves, to love God, and to love others. This is each of your purpose.

My friends I thank you for your time. I love you all dearly and this group, this extended group in this area, is very, very dear to me. For yes, many years ago when I walked on earth, it was a great mission for me to form circles and to teach about Divine Love. I also thank you for continuing with the great blessing of the gift of direct voice. May this gift come into a realization of the many souls on earth. God bless each of you. I love you and I am your friend Alec. God bless you.
