I come because you have been thinking of me and my trials and tribulations and my Crucifixion. I wish to assure you that I did not suffer as greatly as you might imagine, that my Heavenly Father made sure that my body was not in great suffering as those who wished to see me die continued to violate and violate my flesh. My consciousness was with God at the time.

Though my death was premature, the Heavenly Father assured me that my mission was successful, that my disciples would indeed understand my message, the Truth that I came to this world to convey. I see even now this message is alive and well, that you my beloved, beloved friends, continue to uphold this Truth and live by this Truth. Yes, I do continue to bring this Truth to humanity and to all spirits, the Truth of the Father's Love. I continue to work to bring this Truth to all. And I work with you, my beloveds, my disciples, who strive to bring the awareness of the availability of the blessing of the Father's Divine Love to all, no matter their condition, no matter their deeds upon this earth. God continues to love all, to bless all who desire this blessing.

It is my desire, as it is yours, that many will avail themselves of these blessings upon this earth, for this is the great opportunity to every soul, to find their road to redemption, their road to at-onement with God. As you have found your way, beloved souls, may you help to lead others to this great Truth, to express within you the beauty of your souls which have been touched by God. May your gifts indeed flow forth, touching many souls, comforting many souls and bringing Truth to many souls as you continue to be a channel of God's Love in the world. There is no greater calling than this, beloved souls, and no greater blessing that may come with your efforts. Continue to work to bring this Truth to humanity, to walk this path as clearly and completely as you can, to express the Love within your souls with each breath, to be with God, beloveds, to be with God. In this all will come, all will flow to you in Light and Love, harmony and grace.

May the Father's Peace be upon you, beloved souls, enveloping you this day, bringing upliftment this day as your souls continue to yearn for the Father's Touch uplifting you into Light, bringing you closer to His Great Soul. Continue to tarry forth, my beloved, beloved disciples. Bring the Truth of the Father's Love to all you meet. Express this Truth in your eyes, in your embrace, in your countenance. Express this Truth. Bring Light to your world. I will be with you upon your journeys always. My love is with you, beloved souls. God bless you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. God bless you.
