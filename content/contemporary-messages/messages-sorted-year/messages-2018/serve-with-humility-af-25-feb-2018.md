Do you remember the story of your brother Jesus who walked the land speaking the Truth of the Divine Love?  He was often met with skepticism until he displayed and expressed in different ways the power of Love in the world.

And so this is your challenge, beloved souls, as you walk in your world bringing this message which is sanctioned by God and you are given all requirements, your needs are being met to bring this message forward. Yet those you encounter, though questioning and thirsting for Truth, may not believe your message. This is the dilemma of the Earth condition is it not? Something that you will be encountering time and time again in your efforts to bring this Truth. Yet you will plant seeds, beloved souls. You will bring the Truth. Keep in mind that for every soul present, there are many other spirits that accompany them, that the numbers that you are reaching is exponential to the numbers you see in the flesh.

So this is a powerful work that you do. It is the beginning of something quite magnificent and you will be called upon again and again to bring this message forward in the world and you are learning how to communicate and connect with many. You will continue to make these efforts to put your focus upon the task at hand. Each opportunity is an opportunity for growth, to cultivate and to refine your message to the world and pray that God will manifest healing, will manifest Light amongst you and Love. Those who are receptive will feel the power of this and will feel within their hearts the Truth of it. It is not for you to judge or to assess the effects of your efforts, for this is God’s Work is it not? It is for you to follow your guidance. Follow it with wisdom, clarity and humility, to allow God to carry you forth, listening to your guidance, listening to the desires of your hearts to be a channel of Love in this world.

And so, you will find some resistance, but you will also find some receptivity. If you go about this in a way that you desire recognition, approval and acceptance, my beloved souls I am sorry to say that you will not receive these things in great quantities. Yet there are some who will embrace you enthusiastically with love and I know this is gratifying to your efforts, but it is not what you seek. What you seek is to serve God and God always approves and Loves and embraces you, my beloved. This is what you must seek always.  And in this way, you will walk with humility and God will clear the obstructions upon your path and open those doors so that you may walk through in joy and a surety that you are following the Will of God. 

So much awaits you, my beloveds. So much awaits you and we are very pleased that you are willing to make these efforts to be together, to teach together, to embrace those who come upon your path without judgment, without fear. Even without the desire to ensure that each soul within their minds knows the Truth with the language and correctness that you know.  For these expectations cannot be met in one meeting with strangers, but you will speak your Truth in Love and many will catch the words of Truth and they will descend into their souls. So there will be an awareness, a flickering of understanding and this is God’s doing beloved souls as He puts the words in your mouth, as He allows the flow of His Love through you to those you meet, as He manifests the healing, the joy, the atmosphere of Love amongst you.

You are enacting your calling my beloveds. God has called you to service and you will see how God creates the Light. Have your eyes and ears open, your souls ready to give in Love and all will be well beloved souls. All will be well. Walk in faith and the surety that you are in God’s Hands, that you will be channel of His Love. There is nothing to fear beloveds. All will be well.

God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you, dear charges. I love you dearly. I am very pleased with your efforts, your desires to serve. God bless you. God bless you.
