# Soul Awakening, a New Birth

October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

 

I am pleased that you had this prayer so that I might speak. This instrument need not take responsibility for the lack of my presence earlier, for I was not present. I was called away to a dear soul in your world who was asking for me to assist her. This happens on occasions, beloveds, for we have many who we assist in your world and in the world of spirit. At times we cannot be with you. There are always angels with you, beloveds, so you need not worry that you are abandoned at any time, for you are not.

Beloveds, we begin a very wonderful journey together. Each day will bring something new to each one of you. Each day your souls will awaken in another facet of your being. Each day you will come closer to God. Each day you have the beautiful blessing of being with one another, sharing your experiences, opening your true hearts to one another. This is a beautiful gift, beloveds. How many in your world are able to share and experience these things together? You are given a great gift, a beautiful opportunity. God blesses you mightily, beloveds, and we will be with you as you continue this journey together. We love you dearly, beloveds. The awakening of your souls is the most wonderful journey you will ever take. The joy that comes in this awakening, the depth of knowing and feeling and understanding is beyond anything that your material minds may comprehend. 

So this journey, unique for each one, is a birth of sorts, the birthing of a new reality that will emerge from your soul and merge with your mind. This we foster and urge you forward and surround you with our love and keep you close. For in this newness of the birth of your soul, there is a sensitivity and a vulnerability that requires adjustment and strength and faith, so that you may come to know this new person that is you, hidden in the recesses of your soul, but now enlivened by the power of God’s Love. Come forth, my beloveds. Come to know you as you really are. 

God bless you and I love you, my tender, beautiful souls. I love you. (Keea-atta Kem)
