God bless you, I am Andrew. Is it not just wonderful, all the varieties of individuals in this world. So many differences yet you all come together as brothers and sisters when love is present. When love is present, beloveds, there is connection, there is the honoring of life, there is the allowance of these differences in your interactions, communications, prayers. Each soul is different in their personalities, not just within the mind, but within the soul, there are differences amongst you. Not only in the conditions of the soul but in the expressions of the soul for each soul is unique. Each soul is beautifully and wonderfully created by God. And God seeds the universe with such a vast variety of life and variety of souls and this is a great gift.  

If there was universal uniformity, the energetic interactions in the universe could not function to create change and movement. It would stagnate. So it is in these differences, in this uniquenesses, unique qualities of a soul, of a being in God’s universe that create the conditions for growth, expansion, allowing greater expression of each soul. The gift of life, the gift of having a unique soul allows your existence to be conscious and aware and open. 

When the soul is imbued with the Father’s Love, it only enhances and expands these beautiful, unique qualities of each soul. Thus your world and all the universe dances with unique and beautiful expressions of God through each individual and each of His creations. And all seeks harmony. All seeks to be in alignment with God. A soul, in all its unique qualities is the same within each soul in as much as there is a deep desire for at-onement with God for this connection and alignment to take place. Follow your longings, beloved brothers, follow your desires to be in harmony with God, in alignment with God, and awakened within your soul so that you may truly know your Creator and truly know all the unique and beautiful qualities that God has put within you. 

Beloved souls, God’s Blessing of His Love magnifies and accentuates all your lovely facets like a diamond shining in the bright sun that sparkles and responds to the light. So your souls, beloved, beloved souls are awakening and its encrustrations are falling away so that the clear beauty and vibrancy of your soul shines forth in the world and in your consciousness. And in this, God smiles upon you. His joy is immense when he sees a soul awakened, awakened by His Love and expressed in love and shining in love. 

My beloved souls, you are that beautiful diamond of God’s creations. You can and will smile with all its beauty and light so that you too may bedazzle the universe in all your beauty that you are and have been created to be. Beautiful souls, continue to allow the encrustations to fall away and for the light to shine through and in time you will be that dazzling creature and dazzling soul that God has created in all its potentials, in all wonderment of this existence. 

Beloved, beloved souls, be in God’s Grace. Allow His Light and Love to shine upon you so that you may truly be who you are and be in the grace and beauty of His Love. God bless you beloved. I am Andrew and I love you. God bless you.
