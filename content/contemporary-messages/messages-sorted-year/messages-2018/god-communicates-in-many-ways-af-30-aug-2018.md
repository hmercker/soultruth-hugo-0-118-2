God’s breath is upon you, beloveds. He pours His Light, His peace and His Love into your circle. In these times you’ve had together, God has uplifted you all, blessed you in many ways, given you insights, encouraged and brought His Love to you in great abundance. You have been instructed to walk in the world with this light, to be channels of love, to uplift yourselves in this light. For God will indeed answer your call and bring you to a place of peace, joy and harmony. It is but for the asking and is always available to you. Within your souls beloveds, there is a deep longing for this communion in light, this deep peace, this acknowldegement and this love. 

Beloved souls, you now realize that God communicates with you in many ways. God communicates to your soul directly and you communicate with God with your prayers and longings and your thoughts and desires. As you build this conduit that is recognizable and powerful, that brings many insights and blessings to you, your soul begins to awaken, your understanding deepens, that  awareness deep within you emerges into your consciousness. The flowering of truth comes to you, allowing you to conduct yourselves and your life in a way that brings harmony, in a way that is in light and brings peace. 

When you have established this bond with God, this way of communication of the interchange of your soulful energies and God’s great energies and blessings, then you have begun a process that will transform you, beloved souls, and open many gifts. For the faculties of the soul become ignited by the Divine Love. Embedded within these faculties is the ability to communicate with God, with we in spirit, with your own true nature and being. 

Many dimensions are opened with the awakening of your faculties. These senses within  are multidimensional. In this way a clear understanding of truth of the reality of God is possible. As the wisdom of the soul grows, expands, intensifies and deepens, we the angels of Heaven, may utilize the wisdom inherent in your soul, the love that glows in your soul, to communicate with others, through you, in many different ways. Not just through words, but through blessings, through utilizing your gifts to connect with other souls in the world so to clear the way of light,  

God utilizes His instruments, and we are all instruments, beloveds. Our awareness and understanding of God’s Will is deep and comes with the cleansing and expansion of our souls in God’s Love. Your capacity to serve and to know is only limited by the progression of your soul. So with every effort you make to be close to God and to receive this great benediction of love, you continue to forge a connection, to clear this conduit, so that you may receive more and more, know more and more, be used more readily, powerfully and clearly, by God. 

Thus you are fledgling angels, beloveds. God is utilizing you to the fullest of your capacities to be used. As you grow, so shall your gifts, your abilities, and this flow of the enactment of God’s Will in your life. In this way, many of your brothers and sisters benefit by your actions and your dedication. By the growing of your soul, so you bring greater light into this world. In this way beloveds, you are precious to us and to God. For there are few in your world who are truly dedicated to the growing of their soul, this world that is filled with mindful concerns as the human condition dominates and effects this world in so many unfortunate ways. 

God’s ability to make a clear and direct connection with His children is lost in the fog of all of these thought-forms and energies and conditions created by man. So few understand what it is that their souls long for with their minds so distracted and carried away by these conditions. You must step forth, beloveds souls, as you grow and expand in this truth with God and declare that there is indeed a different way, a different flow and understanding that will come with the opening of your soul. This is the truth that will be the key for the salvation of mankind and will change the world. 

You brave and beloved souls step forward and follow this Truth of God’s Love. You begin the process of change that will ignite the entire world. God wishes that all your gifts and abilities, the strength of your light, your wisdom and your love will flow forth in every day and in every way to help ignite this revolution of understanding and living in this world through love. It is a formidable task. For the waves of darkness and misunderstanding, error and deprivation are powerful indeed. Yet God desires that these conditions dissolve in light so that love may flow readily, and harmony comes with this change, that all who live in your world and all who are coming, the children and all who may have the blessing of life in this beautiful world may be loved and cared for, nurtured and shown the way to harmony. Do you not wish to leave this legacy in your life and your actions? To pass on the truth in simple but powerful ways. To enact the truth in your own personal life. To be an example. To be close to God always. 

Every soul is given a choice. You have chosen to step upon the highest path. May you reach out to many others in some way and say to them that they are loved by God and that they may pursue His Love and bring Him into their hearts, into their consciousness, into their life. 

Many blessings and gifts await humanity, but humanity first must awaken from their slumbers. Humanity must come to realize that love is the most important thing of all, that a life predicated upon love is a life lived as God intended. So many feel unloved. So many feel bereft in so many ways. You must teach them. You must show them where they must and can receive and be uplifted and infilled with the greatest of all loves, God’s Love.

There is no other way left for humanity, my beloveds. All of their ideas, solutions, expectations that the intellect and the mind will bring in some future time order and harmony to humanity. But for those who think in this way, they forget about the heart. They do not see the importance in expanding the heart in love, of changing their consciousness so that they may love and recognizing the power of the wisdom of love. If all of humanity could but realize the power of love, both of the natural and the Divine, then many solutions would come, many dilemmas would be solved. So much could be transformed in your world so that there would be equality and the needs of humanity would be met so that each may live a life full and rich with possiblities and with love. You must strive towards these ends, beloved souls. For you are willing to go on that journey of awakening, to come to the realizations that are necessary, that the faculties and wisdom of the soul may carry you to truth and harmony. 

This is your gift, beloved souls, the gift of life. What you do with this gift is determined with each day and each breath. May you reach for the highest and find all that is inherent in the awakening of the soul. The power of love, the power of love, beloveds, is what you need. Go to the source. Receive and come to know, in your own way, this truth, and all that I speak of will come perfectly clear. All that you may do, in this world, will be expanded and awakened, expressed and fulfilled, as God will guide you and use you and nurture you and uplift you. 

God bless you beloved souls. May you come to know your true selves, and within that knowing, express your true gifts in love and harmony. To be truly that magnificent individual that God has created and set forth to grow and progress in the world, in your world and in ours, that long and beautiful journey to God. God bless you beloveds. I am Seretta Kem and I love you. God bless you.
