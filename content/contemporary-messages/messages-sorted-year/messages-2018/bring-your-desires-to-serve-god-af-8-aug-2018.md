Â 

It is nice to see the four of you together again in prayer. I would encourage you to do so as much as you can in the next little while in your preparations for the next step in the development of direct voice. Indeed the better prepared you are for this time when you are all together, the more likelihood there will be a manifestation and the fruition of this great venture. As you well know, taking time in preparation is very important. To prepare yourselves on all levels, to be cognizant of the steps necessary to be in the proper condition so that we may continue the development of this gift utilizing the time that you will be together as efficiently as possible. For these times when you are together in one room are precious indeed, though there is much we can accomplish when you are separated, there are certain aspects of the development within each one of you of these gifts that are ignited by your presence together.

You have had your time to enjoy the sunny weather, to be with your loved ones, to celebrate life and be in the flow of life, and in this time that you have travelled, and had celebrations and connections with many, there has been a gift, a blessing given to each one that you have touched at this time. God utilizes every moment in your lives to use you as an instrument of light and love in the world. Remember this beloved souls, every moment of your life must be a dedication to God. Every prayer must say: "Use me Father as your channel of love in the world," that your willingness and openness, your desire to serve may be used and put into action in loving ways, loving measures which God will guide you upon. 

Beloved souls, you are precious to God. Within your souls burns the flame of God's Love. This powerful energy can bring about many blessings, not only for yourself, but for those around you and for this world. If you could but see the many layers in which God may use an instrument imbued with the Love of God, you would be astounded at what may be accomplished. What flows through this instrumentality, your soul ignited in Divine Love, so much can be accomplished. Much awaits your continued growth, the many blessings and many opportunities that are coming and are opening.

You stand upon a threshold beloveds, a threshold of soul awakening, a threshold of increased service, a threshold of deeper love and joy. Changes are coming beloveds, many surprising opportunities and events in your life unanticipated. Through what is coming you must have a deep faith, a trust in God, releasing your own willful desires to the Will of God. In this way, all will come together in harmony, although there will be challenges and with each of you efforts must be made. There will come a deep satisfaction and joy within your heart because you will recognize that you are indeed being used as a channel of God's Will and Love in the world. Each of you, within your souls, continue to anticipate eagerly what is coming and within your souls you have a sense of what is coming. You must follow the desires of your souls which know with their wisdom and truth within, God's Will, the plan that He has laid out for each one of you beloveds. Listen, seek to know in a conscious way the knowings of your soul. This comes not through mental machinations and imagination, but from a feeling, a sense that grows and deepens and creates greater insight into the reality of God and HIs Will for you. Each day is an opportunity to deepen this understanding, this knowing of your soul. Each day that you indeed step closer, in all ways to God, the path before you will be clear, unambiguous and very compelling indeed.

There is an excitement in your souls beloveds, a deep longing, a desire to continue upon this path that God has designated for you. Bring your prayers into focus towards these ends, longing to serve, longing to be closer to God, longing to receive His Love in ever greater abundance. What will come from this is a deep joy, a deep compassion for your brothers and sisters, a deep love for all, including yourselves. All of these dilemmas, these struggles between your mind and the conditions of your mind and your soul will dissipate like clouds clearing from the sky. The clarity of the sun will shine upon you, awakening you to the call that is God beseeching you to serve in Love. 

God bless you my beloveds. God bless you upon your journeys. Know that I am with you and your guides, teachers and many angels continue to uphold you, to uplift you, to guide you and to bring you closer to God. You are truly blessed beloveds. You are truly blessed. May you continue to grow in His Love and awaken in the Grace and Beauty of God's reality and presence in your life. In this, all else will follow in harmony and grace and beauty, joy and wisdom. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem and I love you. God bless you. God bless you.
