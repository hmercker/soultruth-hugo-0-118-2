Â 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Confucius. Yes, I was the first spirit to speak to this young man many years ago. This was a blessing for me to speak to you on earth, any who are willing to listen, for I have dedicated my life and my being to the service of God. So I come to these realms of the earth plane to try and inspire the souls of mankind to seek God, to seek God with their hearts, to seek the Light of God's Blessings and to seek for the healing and redemption of their souls in Light.

So I wish that I may be with each one of you, my beloved souls, to help you with your prayers, to be with you when you seek to elevate yourselves beyond the conditions of this earth plane, to open your souls, that very most precious part of yourselves, to God, to the Source of all life, so that you may be touched within you and feel the resplendent joy of the Father's Hand upon you and that you may open to the wonderment of your personal and beautiful relationship with your Creator.

Ask for this gift of the Father's Love, the Divine Love, and you will find that many blessings will pour upon you, beloved souls, beautiful, beautiful blessings of joy and Love, healing and peace. It is with you now, beloveds. Drink of these waters. Though the thirst can never be quenched, for your souls long for this and shall long for this for all eternity, you shall find the joy and fulfilment that comes with the touch of the Father's Love, healing, soothing, bringing wisdom, bringing joy to all who seek, for all mankind. For this is meant for every soul; it is meant for you, my beloveds, a gift, a gift from God.

Children, you are never alone. You are always loved. May you come to know that you are never alone. God bless you. Confucius loves you. Little birds, fly home to Heaven, little birds.
