I welcome you, dear daughter (H), back into the fold of your loving brothers and sisters. This will be a very productive time for all of you. There are challenges but great rewards are coming, requiring your focus and attention and prayers. Each day, each moment of each day is required that you all reach for the highest, that your prayers are from your heart seeking great inflowings of the Father’s Love. 

These times that you have together are very precious indeed. We will ensure that there will be no interruptions or disruptions with your efforts. You will enter into the chamber with soulful expectations of reaching the highest. In this way, you will have the highest outcomes, the highest blessings. Each of you have grown much in the last year. Your souls are greater, your understanding clearer, your faith stronger. Your interactions will be harmonious, beloveds, because you have chosen to be in the light and to be strongly thus. Indeed you come to know the power of your own free will and choices. 

How important it is to choose carefully and to be informed of what it is you choose. Indeed we need you to be strong, each one in your circle, to not be drawn away by outside forces or intrusions. This is a blessed but crucial time. We will continue to support you in these efforts. We work together in cooperation and harmony, love and acknowledgement. We will not leave anything to chance, beloveds. We will orchestrate, guide, facilitate and assist in many different ways so that we may indeed have the outcomes that are desirable. Be open beloveds. Be as open and trusting and faithful as you can. It is important because we will be working upon each one of you individually and all of you collectively. 

It is important that you remain in an open and receptive stance through this entire time together. In this way, we may be able to facilitate many things, develop this gift with the power and strength that is required. There is a great plan, beloveds, a great plan. Know that you are part of it. That each of you is capable and gifted, blessed within your souls and destined to work in this way, to bring this gift and many other gifts forward, to bring the truth of God’s Love and blessings to mankind. You carry a great light individually and collectively. It is a light that goes out into the universe. It is attracting attention from even those who reside in different worlds. There is a great hope amongst all beings of God’s creation, all souls, that there will be a turning point in your world from its misery and darkness, to light and joy, truth and peace. 

Though not all rests upon your shoulders, beloveds, you play an important part. Thus you need to be focused and serious about your efforts. What may come in your time together will change you and quite possibly change your life. There is a tremendous potential here to bring the truth, to bring valuable information, gifts and understanding to mankind. We have been waiting a long time for those who are willing to step forward, to dedicate themselves in this way, to bring truth, to bring change and to be channels of love in the world. 

Remember that your brother Jesus walked in the world with great faith. He listened to God’s guidance. He did simple things. He spoke simple truth. He was a channel of love, pure and beautiful. Even today his words and his life have affected many souls in your world. It did not come because he made great effort and planned great things. No. It came because he was humble and he knew the Source of all that is to come and may come to humanity. 

The power of God’s Love, the power of a soul redeemed in God’s Love is capable of many things. So much is possible with the burning flame of this light within the soul, with the trust and faith of one’s soul dedicated to doing God’s Will. This is what is required, beloveds, faith in God, opening yourselves up to know the reality of God and the blessings of God. This you must do together. You must trust one another, a deep trust, a deep love and a beautiful harmony shared. Put aside any reluctance, any doubt and step forward with the innocence of your soul, the knowings of your mind, the efforts that you make to be with God in prayer in listening and loving and serving. For in this way, the doors are opened. The floodgates are opened. Great blessings rush into your souls, awakening every part of you, cleansing every part of you, bringing limitless joy and love. With this, anything is possible. Many things will be possible with your efforts together, reaching in love, reaching in faith and trust.
 
May you continue to be blessed, my beloved friends. I will continue to step forward along with my beloved colleagues to work together to awaken your souls and awaken your gifts and potentials for service to humanity. All is given in love. All is blessed by God. How truly blessed you are, my beloveds, how truly blessed. 

God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you always. God bless you.
