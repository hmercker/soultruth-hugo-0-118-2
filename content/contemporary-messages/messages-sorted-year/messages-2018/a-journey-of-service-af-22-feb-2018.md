# A Journey of Service

February 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2018

Adria Hotel, Queens, New York, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike.

 

I am your teacher, Augustine. There is a purpose to your efforts. You will be carried and we will draw in those souls who are eager to know your message, the message of God's Love. Be open with each moment you are together that you may be used by God as a channel of His Love, that each moment you are in this place there are possibilities present and opportunities to serve God. 

As you well know, you must approach this with the knowings of your soul rather than the understanding of your mind. Listen to the Word of God, the Will of God, the flow of His Love as you work together in these days to come. May that grace and ease and harmony and perfect timing of God’s Will  flow amongst you and through you and out to those whom you will contact in your efforts. Keep the knowings of your soul open, my beloveds. Learn from your experiences. Keep the flow of God's Love rising up through you into the world.

God is with you. We are with you, beloved souls. You will see how we guide you, how you touch other souls as this beloved daughter touched the dear soul who sat beside her. Is this not doing God's work, allowing Love to flow? Wherever you go, my beloveds, there is that possibility. So be open, conscious, prayerful, receptive and yearn to be a channel of Love in the world. You are surrounded by thousands upon thousands of souls, both in the material world and the spirit world. In this way each moment is a possibility, a potential to teach, to heal, to serve and to love. May you come to know this more fully within your consciousness, the consciousness of your souls and see that God places before you a great bounty of possibilities to serve in Love.

God bless you, beloveds. Your teacher Augustine continues to uphold you, to love you and to teach you. I am with you. I shall accompany you on these journeys of service. God bless you.
