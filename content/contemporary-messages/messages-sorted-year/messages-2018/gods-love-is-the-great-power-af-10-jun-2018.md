I am Alec Gaunt. I too was a part of your church many years ago, in its beginnings. I too had my challenges and I challenged others on how to proceed with your beautiful efforts in congregation. It is always challenging to bring people together and inspire them to work together for the greatest good. But I see that God has guided some beautiful souls together who have a deep desire to work together in harmony, to bring Light and goodness and Truth and nurturing to those who are a part of this congregation. You do a great service when you educate those who do not know the truth of the continuance of life. This rudimentary fact is an important piece of the puzzle that many do not understand. From there, to encourage each and every soul to aspire to Light, to harmony, to conduct themselves in the world in a way that is in harmony with God's Laws is very important indeed and to not over-complicate your teachings, my friends, for people do not need all of these esoteric teachings and ideas that only in many cases confuse and muddy the waters. Rather they need simple, usable, practical and inspiring ways to be in the world.

Within your teachings, you speak of God in your tenets. I would encourage you to speak of God from your hearts, from that place of Love and to put the highest always as your benchmark, and to understand that once you tap into the understandings of your soul, the wisdom of your soul, you may teach the Truth in ways that everyone can understand. How does one know one's own soul? Through the blessing of the Divine Love, something which I taught when I was on earth. It must be shared with whoever will listen for it is the highest Truth, my friends, that God's Love is the greatest blessing of all. The essence, the power of this great energy of God conveyed by His Holy Spirit changes everything, it changes you and you can change the world.

That was a great ambition of mine at the latter part of my life, to show the world how it can change and that he source of the power of change is Love. I was not able to complete my mission, but my heart is warmed when I see around this circle those who are strong and in the Light, who are seeking the highest Truth and are seeking to serve humanity. This is how change happens in the world, my friends, to step out into the world in Love and Light, to seek the inspiration from God so that each step that you take is guided and blessed. You can't go wrong, my friends, with this. In time, everything that you do, every effort you make is blessed and has and will have positive outcomes. Isn't it a great blessing that God has brought you together in fellowship to support one another? For you have many gifts, my friends, much to give to one another. So listen, listen intently, listen with the ears of your souls, see with the eyes of your souls, understand with the wisdom of your souls. When there is much to be imparted in this world of yours, so full of contradictory information that is at the very best a semblance of Truth, it is important to keep your understanding simple, your ways clear and sincere, your efforts motivated by Love and a good heart, a heart that is filled with Love.

I am so happy to see that this church has survived all these years. I know it has had its struggles but it has kept its Light and its purpose as a sanctuary of Light. This can only grow when I see those who are a part of it, can only grow and become strong and evermore beautiful in Light. May God bless every effort you make and everyone who is a part of it. The world needs more places of Light such as this. You create such a gift for many souls. Remember this, what you do, the efforts that you make is multiplied many times in benefits for others. In this way you are richly blessed, my friends. You become the beneficiaries of being an instrument of God in the world. You benefit the most. Though you may at times struggle the most, the rewards are great, the efforts, though often unsung, are known by God. He continues to bless you with many benefits, blessings, the help of the angels, His Light and blessings for you and for the many. Continue your work, my friends, continue to seek for the highest and to know that in the end deep peace belongs to you. There will be no regrets, only joy and a sense that you have contributed to the Light that is needed in this world.

May God bless you always and keep you in this Light always. His Love is with you, beloved souls. God bless you. God bless you.
