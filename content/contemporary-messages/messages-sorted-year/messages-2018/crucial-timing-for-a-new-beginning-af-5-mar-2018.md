Â 

It is time to speak to you and thank you for your efforts to come together in this Light, for your timing is crucial and the time that you spend together at this time is crucial. For many things are happening upon your world, the changes that we have warned you about and continue to inform you of, are beginning to manifest in more direct ways in your world. I wish to remind you that the purpose of your efforts here is to bring a clear message to humanity, one that is undeniable, one that is powerful and one that is beautiful in its Light and Love.

This gift will be manifest not so much from your efforts, although your efforts are well appreciated and necessary. It is the Touch of God that will bring this about. You have come together today with the realization that nothing may happen without God's Blessing and Touch upon it, so that it may be as it should be and manifest in all of its perfection and glory. So in this room together, you continue your journey of faith, your desire to serve, with your gifts unfolding in all its beauty.

So we are all here with you. We continue to convene together for this purpose and we will work together with great conviction and fullness. I would urge you, beloved souls, to bring your thoughts up high, to be together in harmony, to nurture your bodies, your spirits, your souls and do not let your minds carry you away into thoughts and realms which detract from this effort. Continue to commit yourselves to be held by this condition of Love and Light. We are here, the beloved sister is here, and we will work again together to bring about these specific manifestations in order to communicate with the world on their journeys in ways which they may understand. This is a special gift. Even God and your souls rejoice in this, as do we rejoice in this great gift, great blessing to be together again. Our love is with you. God's Hand is upon you and we will all be blessed in this wondrous effort to bring Truth to humanity, Love to the world, healing to your planet, harmony to all. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. I am very happy to be with you once again in this way. God bless you. I love you.
