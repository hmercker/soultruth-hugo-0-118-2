May the Father's peace be a mantle upon you and His Love pour into your souls, His infinite Love always available, always there for your asking and receiving. May you carry this Light. May you express this Love. May you walk on the footsteps of the Divine Path which will take you ever closer to at-onement with God.

I am Andrew. My love is with you, my beloved brethren. May you continue to pursue this Path. May you have a curiosity that helps you to move forward in your understanding of this Path, the understanding of your souls, the understanding of the wonderment of the Father's Love.

God bless you, beloved souls. May God uplift you and carry you beyond the mundane of this world to awakening the knowing of your souls of God. It is but a prayer away, a touch, as you open yourselves and seek this gift, bringing this gift a portion at a time within your souls, loosening up those conditions within you, those dark energies that every soul in this world carry from a life lived in this world. Bit by bit, God lifts these conditions from you replacing them with His Love. As you breathe it in, open yourselves to this gift infiltrating all the nooks and crannies of your soul, these chambers so in need of the Father's Touch.

This gift of grace is for you, my beloved, beloved friends. This gift of grace will uplift you and heal you and bring you ever closer to God. May you feel the Peace that passes all understanding. May you know your Creator in a personal way, to truly know God, to have this deep relationship with your Creator, personal, beautiful, sacred. Walk with God, my beloved, walk with God. God bless you. I am Andrew and I love you.
