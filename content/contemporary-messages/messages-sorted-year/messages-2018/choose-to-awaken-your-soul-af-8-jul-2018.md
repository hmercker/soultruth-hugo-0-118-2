I am this dear soul’s guide and have been with him for many years. I have come today to encourage you to open yourselves to this gift of Divine Love, this Love that is all around you, beloved souls, but needs an opening to be within you. This substance only comes within your soul by invitation, with a desire to God, a prayer to open the floodgates to receive this gift, this eternal flame of Love, that God will place within your soul, and shall remain forever. Each time you seek this gift and receive it through earnest prayer and longing, that light will build. The flame is stoked by your prayerful efforts. Within you will be a burning light, a gracious gift, a harvesting of fruits of the soul, as all begins to form and grow within you. Many aspects within you that are of the soul will be awakened by the power of God’s Love, His Essence finding its true mark within you. Beloved souls, may you be blessed and know your true selves, that eternal self that is your soul. May it truly be awakened by God’s Love. 

I am Andrew. May God bless you beloveds. May God bless you richly and mightily with this inflowing of the Divine Essence of God. God bless you beloveds. Open yourselves to this gift, feel its presence with you now. It is a gift to you, beloveds, a gift to all souls who seek. God bless you, God bless you beloveds. I am Andrew and my love is with you. God bless you.
