I continue to minister to your bodies, your spirit body and your physical body and to encourage you in your prayers and my commitment will carry on as you disperse in the world. I will continue to assist you and be with you on your journeys. Listen to that wisdom within you beloveds, that guides you in your daily life, that guides you in the foods that you consume, in the thoughts that you have, in the efforts that you make to be God’s channels in the world. For all this wisdom comes from that deep place that God has touched with His Love and it is available to each of you. We will help you to clearly understand the truth that is within your souls and we continue to bring our gifts of healing, of love and wisdom. We continue to touch you each day and help you to grow and help nurture those gifts that lie within your souls. We are with you, beloveds, and our commitment continues as you continue to strive for the awakening of your souls and the fulfillment of your purpose and service to God. 

I will be with each one of you. I will strive to help you to strengthen in your physical, in your spiritual and to help bring clarity to your minds and to assist in this great effort to awaken your souls. So much has been accomplished while you’ve been together. You cannot see everything that has been brought forth by these efforts but you must feel the difference within you, how you have been uplifted, strengthened and how greater wisdom comes to you. This will continue to build within you provided that you make the efforts necessary to extricate yourselves from the earthly conditions, to be strong enough to walk in the world but not be of it. We have given you great opportunities to come to know this way of life and being in the world and now it will require your fortitude and strength to carry on in this light, to push away those temptations that bring you into darkness or disharmony. 

It is a great gift that you’ve been given, beloveds, a great gift. May you understand and see the pearls that heaven laid at your feet and incorporate this wisdom and love in your lives. Walk in truth, beloved friends. Walk in faith. Walk in love and all else will fall into your laps readily. There will be no mysteries. What is meant to come will come as if it was always meant to be. You will see. You will see, beloveds souls, how God will indeed guide you along this destiny and open every door. All you need do is walk forward in trust and faith and all will be as is meant to be.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Lotus Blossom and I love you. God bless you.
