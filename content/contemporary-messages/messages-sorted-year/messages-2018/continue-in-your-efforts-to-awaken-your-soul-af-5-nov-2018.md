Hello, it is Jocelyn.<sup>1</sup> I wish to talk to my beautiful friend and student of God’s Love. I want to tell you how close I am to you, my beloved, beloved brother and how happy I am to see that you have ventured forth in the world, that you continue to learn and to grow in your soul and be a true child of God in His Love. Beloved brother, continue in your efforts to awaken your soul, to know God and be close. Continue to read and to come to make truth out of that which you read and that it may indeed settle into your soul and bring wisdom and insight. The power and the strength of God’s Love will transform all that is in your mind and bring it to truth. You will speak words in gentle ways and strong ways and beautiful ways. It will touch many souls. You will see beloved friend, you will see how all your efforts and struggles will come and bring a great fruition of your gifts and purpose in the world. Yes, it has been hard-won but it continues to grow and flourish and become what is meant to be by God. 

Beloved friend, know that I am well, that I reside now within the Celestial Kingdom and I am with you often as are many of us angels who continue to serve to the glory of God and the Truth of His Love. 
God bless you, beloved, beloved brother. I have never forgotten and never will our special bond together. God bless you. God bless you, my friend.
