I do wish to add my congratulations, appreciations and love to your efforts and to see how you have widened your perspectives and allowed God to guide you along this course of action, prayer and reflection. As also that you have accepted this journey as it has widened and come to a different place than you anticipated. This indicates a mature soul, a wise soul who realizes that the outcomes that are imagined by the mind are not necessarily in alignment with God’s Will and that in this acceptance comes the beginning of knowing God’s Will and allowing it to manifest in your lives with the understanding that what we may dream of, those of you who are human and rely so heavily upon your material minds, is merely a fraction of what is meant to be by God. Therefore your visions are limited, your understanding narrowed by the filters and expectations of your mind. We have encouraged and guided you towards coming to know your souls and the perceptions and faculties of your souls. That in this, the field of knowledge, of knowing, is widened tremendously as your souls awaken in the Father’s Love. 

We have talked of a new perspective, a new reality that comes with this awakening. We have discussed the power of love, the power of prayer, the soul’s capacity for compassion and the soul’s ability to see clearly the truth as it is in deep communion with God. You are coming to know your soul’s purpose, your soul’s possibilities, your soul’s longings and desires. 

We continue upon this progressive path of soul awakening. And yes, you will come together again, beloveds, in this pursuit and you will discover more things about yourselves and the treasures that are laid up in your souls. This awakening is a series of discovery where you may enact and express the many gifts of your soul. There is still much to learn, beloveds.  Your souls have the capacity to expand and express itself in so many ways through so many innate gifts and abilities that are awakened by love. So to think that you may come to a place of awakening is not entirely true. There are milestones upon that path where you may come to a higher place of knowing and being within your souls but this is just one rung upon the ladder, one step forward of many countless steps towards at-onement with God. 

But here we celebrate the steps that you have taken while together, that you made the decision to come together, to be together, to spend this time out of your lives to pray, to focus upon your souls and to be in communion with God. We do indeed congratulate you upon your efforts and what you have accomplished together. Yes it is not one thing but many things. It is not one gift, but many gifts. It is not one step, but many steps. You will continue upon this road, not with a sense of fatigue but with a feeling of joy, acknowledging that you traverse the path that is meant for you, that nourishes your soul, awakens your being to new life, new beginnings and new awakenings. 

May God continue to bless you so. Your friend and fellow traveler Martin Luther is with you and I shall continue to assist you, to pray with you, to help light the path for you. My love is with you, my brothers and sisters. I will walk with you always. God bless you. God bless you.
