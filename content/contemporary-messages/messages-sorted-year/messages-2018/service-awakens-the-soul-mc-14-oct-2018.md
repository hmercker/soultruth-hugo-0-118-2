# Service Awakens the Soul

October 14<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

It was a very great day, partaking in service, serving your brothers and sisters, serving your Heavenly Father, and serving the awakening of your souls. Do you see how these things are intertwined? For as you help to elevate and uplift and be in the light of service, this also brings great light to you. Many were touched deeply as you worked side by side, as you shared in your talk today on the power of love. We were with you and present, helping to uplift, elevate, support and influence all there. 

Did you not feel the great joy of the sun, the fresh air, working side by side with one another and building relations? These very simple acts are instrumental in your growth. Do you see as the power of your circle, the love that is bonding each and every one of you here? Do you see how powerful that love bond is in the effect that it can bring to others? Today was an extraordinary day on many levels and we wish to acknowledge the efforts that you put forth. 

When you are in these environments and giving service, it does not feel like effort for you are giving from your soul. Your mind is aligned with love. There is joy in your expression. There is laughter that is shared. None of this feels like effort. My friends, that is part of alignment. When things simply flow and there does not feel like there is a great deal of effort that you are needing to put forward, that is part of alignment. This beautiful Centre of Light, this sanctuary, emanates love. The idea of you continuing to build your relationships there and continuing to offer your service, supporting those, will bring great strength and love to you and those in attendance. 

It is joyful to see the seven of you and those others that joined you, who are also very close to you. It is wonderful to have time together in such a way that there is such a great sense of ease and peace and service. Beloveds, it was very joyful to watch you today and be working alongside you and to support you. 

In the coming days ahead, continue in the way that you have been. Sit with your prayers, spending individual time and spending time together with one another. And yes, the dear soul leaves in a few days, and we will accompany him home in safety. We ask that he does commit and make the effort to join into the prayer that is right in timing, suitable in timing in his day. This is an important part of continuing to facilitate the awakening. 

I wish each of you a good night, God’s blessings upon you. May you feel God closely to you always, knowing Him, His Love, His Care, His guidance, allowing it to serve you, calling upon your Heavenly Father in all deeds. 

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. I love you and good night.
