We have been working on your bodies and your spirit bodies today helping to prepare you for the gift of Direct Voice. My wish is that you do not think of this project as something insignificant in your lives. It is easy to be distracted by all the aspects of your life in this world of yours. We desire that you place your thoughts upon this project. Give it some prayer and thought each day. Continue to prepare yourselves, to work together in prayer, to give this your focus, to cultivate within yourself a sense of optimism and confidence that you will move forward in this effort. 

Yes you will be required to come together as a group once again at some future time and convenience in order to continue in this development. In the meantime these prayers that you have together and your personal efforts to put your focus upon this project are important. Do not let your thoughts slip away, your enthusiasm be drawn by other concerns. The intensity of this effort, the requirements of this project are indeed important, that you continue to focus, concentrate, pray and be in harmony with the efforts that we make on your behalf.

We will continue to work together, beloved souls. We require your cooperation, your prayers, your enthusiasm and your love that all may come together in harmony. We are not taking a hiatus in the development of this project and in your personal development regarding this gift. We continue to forge ahead. Each day that you dedicate in prayer, that you uplift yourselves, that you make effort towards your physical well-being, pushes this project a little further ahead. Of course each day has its challenges. Each day may distract you but it is for you to be disciplined, to allow us to work with you, to be close to God, to be in the light, to pray for His Love. Create harmony in your lives, beloved souls. Remember that you have dedicated yourselves to this work and it requires your focus and dedication, your efforts in prayer, your enthusiasm, those thoughts that support and encourage this work. 

Much responsibility lies with you, my beloveds. Remember you are together, we are all together in this work and we shall continue to work together. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. I am close to you each and every day, beloved souls and we will accomplish our tasks. The timing of which depends on you and the efforts that you make, the responsibilities that you engage within and take seriously. 

God bless you, beloved souls. May the Father’s Love continue to pour within you and may you continue to reach out to one another in love, that the continuation of this work may be a steady, upward advancement. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. The angels are with you. God is with you. God bless you. God bless you.
