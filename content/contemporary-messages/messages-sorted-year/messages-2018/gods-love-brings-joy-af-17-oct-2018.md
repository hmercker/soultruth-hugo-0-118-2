I am Goldie. It is a good day to feel the warmth of the sun, the beautiful soft air caressing you, the flowers, the trees, the waters and the skies all joyfully acknowledging you with their beauty and grace, beloved, beloved friends. I am with you in your efforts to bring more joy to this world. The greatest joy comes from God’s Love, does it not, as your souls sing in joy and acknowledgement of the beauty of life and the wonderment of your own being. Beautiful souls, I love you and I am with you. Goldie loves you.
