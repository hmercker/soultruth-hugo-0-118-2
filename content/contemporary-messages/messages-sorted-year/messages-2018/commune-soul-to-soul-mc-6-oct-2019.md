There is instrumental growth in each one of you, the expansion of your souls merging with your mind. You feel and sense at different times the greater harmony that exists within you and the strength that this gives you in your expression, in the joy that you feel within your being. 
 
Beloveds, over this time that you are together hold compassion for yourselves and for one another, for there will be shifts that happen within you. Some sensitivities may arise. Your true security, your true saviour is to be in the arms of God, resting in that place of truth and comfort, a forever lasting strength and union that you build, your soul to God’s Soul.

Celebrate your circle of seven, the beauty, the bond, the love, the unity that you each feel.  We see this clearly from our side of life and I come to encourage you to be in nature, to take your time in solace, to be with yourselves and your Creator.  Take a time away individually, be in nature, be refreshed, be uplifted, be strengthened.  Tune into your needs and the needs of one another, building a silent strength amongst you.  Commune soul to soul, words are not required.  Strengthen that in you beloveds, allow your souls to commune with one another.  What does that feel like in you?  Create a stable environment within yourself relaxing your mind, developing and disciplining this communication, this way of communication with one another.

Of course, it does not mean to not verbally communicate, but try being amongst one another in the silence of your souls as you move about.  This too is a valuable exercise, for as you strengthen in your soul expansion and awareness, the tune of the soul does commune greatly without any words.  You each have this ability and capability.  Bring this into your day amongst one another but also as you are out there individually in the world.  Tune into the soul of another. Begin to feel how your soul communes. Allow this exercise to be expressed in your life beloveds.  It will bring deep peace, joy, clarity and a sense of purpose in the way that you relate to those whom God places before you. Nothing is random in your lives. See the work of God in every step that you take and that which comes before you. See the workings of God, the unfoldment of His plan. Allow that to be your dominant way of expressing and receiving and loving that which comes before you. Strengthen in this task beloveds; strengthen in this way of being in the world.

It is such a great blessing to be a part of and working together with beloved souls on this earth who yearn to grow in love, in strength and in harmony.  I bring my love to you, the bright colours and the lights of God to bless each of you.  God bless you in your day in this continued journey.  I love you.  I am Keea Atta Kem and I am with each of you often.  God bless you, I love you.
