God bless you, I am Matthew. Yes you begin the final leg of your journey together, for the awakening of your souls. There is an appreciable difference in your light from the time when you began to now. Your souls have benefitted by your efforts, beloveds. You continue to inch closer to God and to allow the changes and revitalizing of your soul to come to the fore in your consciousness. Beloveds, you are well on your way in this journey of awakening. You continue to focus your attentions upon your soul and your relationship with your Heavenly Father. We encourage you to continue in your efforts and to strengthen your resolve and your focus and your desires upon receiving the blessings of the Father’s Love. 

Since the beginning of your gathering each of you have had a grouping of angels who have engaged in a prayer vigil for each one of you, in constant prayer for the upliftment of your souls. This continues and shall continue. This is a measure of how much you are loved, beloveds, how much the angels seek for the fruition of your salvation through love, the awakening of your souls through love and the expression of your souls in love. Very few in your world have received these attentions and efforts. It reflects the mark of your own efforts and commitment towards at-onement with God within your souls, and for your intentions to serve God and to bring greater light and truth to this world. So as it has been and always will be, the responsibility rests upon you and your efforts, your prayers, your thoughts and your actions. In this time, these few days that are left, may your focus and resolve be great, your prayers constant and your efforts for harmony be a constant focus of your daily life, so to uplift yourselves ever higher in the development and awakening of your souls, whose greatest desire is to be with God. 

Beloveds, you continue to receive the support and love of the Celestial Kingdom. God continues to place His Hand upon you. Many prayers are being said for your benefit, beseeching God to touch you deeply and to heal all that is contrary to the laws of His Love, to awaken all that is within you that is complimentary to the laws of His Love, that you may find the deepest joy, the greatest peace, the most beautiful awakening. All of this lies within your souls, these great potentials. This awakening is available to each one of you and none are excluded. 

Beloved souls, can you walk a little further in these efforts to bring forth the highest, the wonderment and beauty of your own souls in relationship with God? So that you may walk upon this earth as a pure and mighty channel of His Love, that your gifts may be used to touch many souls, that this channel of love that is forged within your soul may be wide, embracing many, guided by God and awakened in love. We can go no further in these steps of development of your gifts without your cooperation and efforts in prayer. Your focus must be clear and complete for these days that come. The rewards from your efforts will be great, my beloveds, this I promise you, great indeed. 

Much will come from the awakening of your souls. Much is possible with the infusion of the Father’s Love within every part of your being, enlivening, bringing greater life to you, to your life, to all that is within your life, and to this world. For God needs channels of love in this world. For His Will to be enacted in this world, there must be those who are attuned and aligned with God, that the blessings of His Love may be strong within you, that the power of this awakening may bring the insights and wisdom and truth that mankind needs in order to complete their journeys on earth in light, love, and harmony. 

Mankind must know that there is a choice, just as you know there is a choice with each moment. They must see the benefit of this choice for love. And this is demonstrated through you, beloved souls, as you witness your own transformation, as you express this in your own unique and beautiful ways, as these many gifts within you are expressed and flow through you for the benefit of many. 

Do you understand what we are asking of you, beloved souls? We are not just making these great efforts for your personal benefit. We make these efforts so that you may go out into the world and bring change and blessings, comfort, truth, healing, love to others as God’s instruments, as His channels of Love. 

As always with God, there will be harmony. All will fall into place, provided that you are able to listen, that you are able to be strong within your resolve and desires to serve God. In this way, all that is meant to be will be revealed and awakened within you, that you will know without a doubt who you are, your purpose, your gifts, your soul, and your connection with God. 

This is your goal, beloved souls, to step into this new way of life, of being in the world, to allow the transformation of your souls to awaken every part of your being and every aspect of your life. You will be changed, beloveds, as this is the Law of Creation. All things change and evolve and strive towards harmony. So it will be with your souls and your beings; to awaken, to be a light and an expression so beautiful, so wonderful, that many will feel the difference within you and will be drawn to you, beloveds. 

God will guide you upon this path of service for the benefit of mankind. You will willingly go with joy and gratitude, for the opportunities that the Heavenly Father will lay before you, and give to you such grace, such strength, such love, that all will be a beautiful outflowing, outpouring, of life and love.

Seek to be in God’s Grace at every moment while you are together, beloveds. In this time that is short, to put every effort possible towards the awakening of your souls, to redouble your efforts in prayer, to be aligned with this great outpouring and flow of love and grace. It pours towards you, beloveds, in support of these efforts that you make so you will walk in light, and accompanied by the angels of the Celestial Heavens who continue to witness the birth of your soul. 

May God bless you, my beloveds, and keep you in His Grace and Love, uplifting, healing, bringing wisdom and strength. God bless you. I am Matthew. My love is with you and I am with you constantly in these efforts to break through the human condition and find your freedom with God. God bless you.
