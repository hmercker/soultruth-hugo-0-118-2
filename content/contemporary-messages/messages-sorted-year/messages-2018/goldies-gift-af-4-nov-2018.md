I want you each to know that I have come to each one of you as you prayed today and I brought a flower to each one of you to signify how God loves you and how we in spirit love you dearly and wish for you to know the joy of this love and be in the grace of this love, to be uplifted always in this love, and know that you have an angel with you always, my friends, always. God always provides for you an angel to light your way, to assist you and comfort you upon your path, and to inspire you to greater prayer and awakening to God. You are loved, beloveds, each one of you, each one of you and you are not alone. In fact, you are never alone, for God is always there with you. We are always by your side and you will continue to have this light and love and comfort and support with you as long as you continue to desire to be in this Grace of God’s Love.

Goldie loves you. Goldie loves you. God bless you.
