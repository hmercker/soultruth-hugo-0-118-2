# Love is the Great Liberator

August 30<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada - Mediumship retreat

Received by Jesper Sorensen

Â 

Love is the great liberator. Love is the thing that will set your soul free from the encrustments and the darkness that has been inculcated in your souls. Divine Love will heal all that and bring you nearer to God. You must realize that every time you receive a portion of this Divine Love you are in at-onement with God to the degree that you have His Love in your soul. At-onement does not just happen one day. It happens every minute that you are receiving God's Love.

I wish to say that is a wonderful group of wonderful people, you are all a part of the plan of God's salvation for humanity. This is a beautiful thing. I love you all dearly. I will always watch over you so you have nothing to worry about. Love is a thing to be sought for as you are doing. This will bring a big change to this world. You must believe that and know that in your heart.

I wish to say that this is good for now. I will be back. God bless you dear souls. I am Jesus. I love you.
