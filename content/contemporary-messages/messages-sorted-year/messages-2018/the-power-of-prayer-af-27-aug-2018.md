There is a great Light encompassing you, beloveds, the Light of Peace, the Light of God’s Presence with you. This Light is bright and powerful. It is beaming forth to many other souls, all souls. For when you pray in this way, and you pray for the world, this Light reaches many souls. Not just souls whom you pray for, not just souls who you imagine are worthy or are praying for this gift, but reaches all souls. So you create a powerful blessing that reaches out into your world and into the world of spirit. 

Many, countless are blessed by God through your efforts to be together in harmony and unity, in love and in truth. The power of prayer, beloved souls, is what brings this gift to you and to many others. The power of prayer, which is little understood in your world, is an effective vehicle to bring healing and change to your world. As long as your intentions and desires are for the highest and the greatest good, you will be a channel of love and light in circles such as these, that will reach out into your world and my world, and have its effects and blessings upon many. 

It is your faith, the knowings of your soul, the beautiful efforts and longings of your soul, that bring these blessings forth into your world. Send your longings forth, beloveds. You have the most perfect vehicle to bring the blessings from God to Earth - it is your longing soul. When you come together in Circles of Light and you are all praying for the same thing with a powerful longing, this is how what you would call miracles can happen. For to have souls in alignment together in prayer brings certain laws into effect and blessings then may pour forth. The floodgates are open. The power and wonderment of God’s Touch upon you may be released in great torrents of Light. Such blessings and gifts are possible at any time. Do not limit your thinking in this regard, but be open and faithful to this truth, knowing that your personal capacity and ability to pray may bring any amount of response and blessings to others. 

You are gifted with many potentials, beloved souls. Much comes with your faithful efforts. This will grow as your souls grow in the Father’s Love. Always begin such prayers with a heartfelt desire for this blessing. All else falls from this and touches many in your earth plane. This simple truth brings many gifts and blessings. 

Blessed souls, you are uplifted in love, gifted in love, healed in love, and many benefit from your efforts. Continue with your prayers. Continue to be uplifted. Continue to be strong in your faith and sincere in your desires. Send your intentions to God and God will always respond for the greatest good and highest blessings. 

God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you in this Light always. God bless you and I love you. I am Andrew. God bless you.
