Â 

I come, I am Jesus. You have brought me with your prayers and your sentiments. I come to be with you, beloved souls, for many times I have come to this earth since my passing into spirit. Many times I have heard the conversations of those who seek the Truth. Many times I have heard the yearnings of the souls of your brothers and sisters in this world. I tell you, I come. I come in Love. I come in peace. I come because my Heavenly Father urges me forward to bring Light and Love to this world and to all worlds. I come because I love you and I love all of humanity for we are all brothers and sisters in this world. We are all a part of this great chain of Love and life together. Those who seek to bring Light and goodness and Love in the world will be blessed by God. I come to reiterate the Truth, that your Heavenly Father, the Source of all, is Love and that you are all loved by God.

Seek His Love. Seek to know His Love. Seek to be in the Light of His Love and you shall be carried forth in Light. You shall be awakened in Light and Love and you shall know the Truth, beloveds, the Truth that I carried, the Truth that exists evermore in your world and all worlds, that the power of God's Love is the greatest blessing of all. Seek you the kingdom, seek God and His Love and you shall be blessed, beloveds.

Blessing to you on this day. A blessing to you, beloveds, on this day. God bless you.
