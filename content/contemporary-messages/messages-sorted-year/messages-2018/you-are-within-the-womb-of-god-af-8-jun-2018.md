I am your teacher Augustine. I welcome you to this circle of Light and this time you will be spending together, in prayer and in conversation together in sharing your aspirations and the desires of your heart. Though the winds may blow and the rain may fall, at this time that you spend together, you are within the womb of God. In this place of Light we ask you to open your hearts, to yearn with your souls for that deep place within you, to be with God at this time and all the times that you are together for these few days feel the longings of your heart. Place before God these longings and desires. Ask that He heal you with His Love, His tender Touch upon each one of you beloved souls. All those who are coming have heard the clarion bell asking for them to gather in this place of Light, that you may all receive together and feel the joy, the peace and the awareness of God’s Presence with you. For each of you that is coming and is here, feel a longing within your hearts to be together in Light, to receive all the blessings that God has to give. God is  bountiful, His Blessings pour forth to every soul who seeks, every soul that longs and desires peace and Love, joy and Truth. God pours His blessings upon you beloveds. Feel the upliftment, feel the Grace of God upon you. Allow this Love to enter your souls, With every breath bring it into yourselves, beloveds, and release all those conditions of this world that bring a stress and a strain that press upon you. Allow these things to fall away. 

God wishes for you to be healed, blessed and uplifted, that the Light within your soul increases and with the awareness of your mind comes the Truth. It comes in this beautiful flow, the on-rush of Love, the uplifting presence of the angels who are with you. Each soul who enters this circle will have an attending angel with them who will be with them for this time. Ask your questions, beloveds, when you are together in conversation, share your stories, share your dreams and aspirations for a more spiritual life, for here you have a place and you will be listened to, beloveds. You will truly be heard, and your hearts shall grow in love and fondness for one another. God will carry you forth, deeper into His Love and peace, closer to His Being and an awakening and  expansion of your true selves, your souls, is a possibility while you are together governed by your willingness to release all barriers and resistance to God. 

Be at peace, my beloveds. Each of you are truly loved by God. Upon your life's journeys it is for you to realize the extent and breadth of His Love for you. This simple longing and desire from deep within is the key that opens this door and allows all good and Light, beauty and grace, Love and joy to enter into your hearts. In this you will release your pain, your doubt and all that is a burden to your life may be released with the blessing of the Divine Love. It gives us great joy to see you willingly step into this womb of Light. God pours His blessing upon you and upon us. It is the grace and Truth of God’s Love being expressed as it flows and heals and envelops those beloved souls who come to receive and to give. 

God bless you, my beloveds. I am your teacher, Augustine and my love is with you. I will be with you for this time and other angels will accompany you. Blessings of Love and Truth, words of assurance and wisdom will be given. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls. I love you.
