I too walk with you on your travels towards God and your desires to serve humanity. 

As you continue to grow in the Love of God and your awareness expands and grows in concert with the Love that grows within you, so you will see the road you must travel, so you will know the work you must do. Do not try to make your plans outside of God’s Will, beloved souls, but to seek the Will of God, to know the Will of God and His Plan for each one of you, my beloveds. For in this way all will be in harmony and flow in grace and peace.

There is no need for struggle, my beloveds. Those struggles come with the resistance of your minds. Allow your souls to take precedence. In this way, all will be known and the surety of your souls will bring you comfort and joy. Yes this world brings on many trials and tribulations, worries and cares. I tell you, with the soul expanded in the Father’s Love, these things will not be so important. These worries will fall away and that which is difficult will not be so. You will rise above the conditions of this world and appreciate the beauty of your souls, the wisdom of your souls and the glory of your souls.

I will walk with you, my daughter. I walk with you, and I will carry you through your life. This is my promise, beloved daughter. I will carry you through your life and guide you thus along this journey of service for God. You have just begun your journey and it will take you through a road filled with wonders and service, blessings and Love. Be at peace, my daughter, you are loved and cared for, you are never alone and we care for your children. Know this, that God has His Hand upon them, as He has with you, my daughter. Beloved soul, God will answer your prayers and bring you into greater Light. As you release the conditions that have held you from this Light, they continue to fall away with every prayer, every prayer. You are blessed and healed.

My son, continue in your prayers. Be true to what you know. Be strong in your heart. Do not allow the negative conditions of this world to impinge upon the Light within your soul, my beloved, beloved son. For God is with you and carries you into Light. God will give you the healing you require to live your life with strength and joy. The only thing that holds you, my son, is you. Let go of your fears. Let go of those things that keep you from God, and you will find your way to at-onement, my son. You are destined to walk through the threshold of the Celestial Heavens, to be with God in atonement, as are all here. You shall one day walk through this threshold and know the joy of boundless Love. 

Beloved souls, as you continue to serve, and seek to serve God, know that every step that you take, every effort that you make in this world is blessed. Do not consider the numbers of souls that you touch, merely that you are a Light in the world, and God will touch many souls through you. Whether you are aware or not, this happens, regardless. Many souls were touched today, many souls. You will continue, as you walk your road, to touch many souls and bring comfort and bring the message of the Father’s Love.

I know you feel a need to see and know, to make your efforts something concrete so that you may have no doubt or worry and see your effectiveness as a servant of God. I tell you my beloveds, each breath you take, you serve God. Each prayer you make, that service increases the power of your gifts, multiplies and counts yet more evidence into this world.

It is important that you have faith, my beloveds, and patience to allow your destinies to unfold in accordance to God’s Plan and timing. When you are within the flow of God’s Plan, you feel the comfort and you know that you are in His Grace. This is your signal that you continue to follow the Will of God. You feel the joy of it, the beauty of it. And the Love of God pours upon it all.

You will not waste your time, my beloveds. You will continue to grow and to serve and to serve worthily within this wondrous flow of God’s Plan for the salvation of mankind. Be at peace and know the angels surround you, that God’s Love continues to pour into your souls. Do not let your minds convince you that you are not serving God. For you do and you will. All is in the flow of the Father’s Will. Be at peace, beloveds, be at peace.

Know you have the highest angels with you, walking with you, teaching you, inspiring you, serving through you and bringing you closer to God. This is your truth now, my beloveds. This is your life. Be joyful that you have found the road to God and at-onement, the highest road of all. How precious you are, beloved souls. How beautiful is your Light. God bless you.

I am Mary, and I love you, my children on earth. I love you, and I care for you, and I am with you. God bless you, God bless you.
