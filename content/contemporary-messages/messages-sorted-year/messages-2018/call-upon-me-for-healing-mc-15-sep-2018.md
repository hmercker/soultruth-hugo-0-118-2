# Call Upon Me for Healing

September 15<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Phoenix, AZ. U.S.A. - A.R.E.I. Conference

Received by Maureen Cardoso

 

I offer to you to invite me to be near you for healing, for it is not easy to be in such conditions and some of you are feeling drained by spending time in the conditions such as you have these past couple of days. I am there to offer you healing. Call upon me as you retire at the end of your day and to be around you when you are feeling some weakness or lack of energy from these conditions. It is important that you do pace yourselves and you take the time to nurture your well-being. It is good that you gather in prayer together while you are here, for your souls to be nourished and healing to be offered to your bodies and your minds. 

When you return to your homes, should you feel the need to retreat into some quietness, it is important to listen to your body and to de-clutter your mind if you feel an effect from being in these conditions. Yes you have the cloak of protection, but somehow still these conditions can affect you. So beloved souls please call upon me and I will be with you offering my healing and my love. 

Thank you for the times you have taken from your lives, hearing your guidance and being in this place. Know that there is much more that has happened than you can see with your eyes. You’ve walked through the door, planting seeds, embracing souls, and doing the Will of God. Do not place judgement if you feel that you have not made strong connections at this time. Let things unfold and watch, watch how the orchestration will be played out. 

God bless each of you, my love is with you. I am Lotus Blossom, God bless you.
