Ah my little birds, how you love to flock together and pray together in the light of God’s beloved touch upon you. Indeed you will take flight as the world draws you to many places, to many souls who are in deep need of this Truth that you carry, in deep need of the comfort that you bring, in deep need of the light and the blessings that comes with your instrumentalities in the world. May your flights be swift and reach its mark as God lights your way, beloved souls, and carries you into deeper service to God. You are protected and no harm will come to you, my beloveds. Many, many doors are opening. Walk willingly into this lighted passage of service and many blessings and miracles will follow in your stead. 

Beloved souls, you are given a gift at this moment to strengthen you and propel you upon this path. You are dearly loved by many in the world of spirit. Many will be drawn to you, beloved souls, as you carry the Truth beyond the measure of your own lives to many lives in the world. God bless you. Yes, you carry the waters of life and you shall quench the thirst of many in this world. God bless you and keep you in His care and Love. Confucius loves you dearly and I am with you often. God bless you.
