Received by Al Fike

 

I am Jesus and I walk with you my son and as you make your efforts to teach the children of the Father’s Love, know that I am with you. I stand by your side. I whisper in your ear. I bless those who are with you. I will continue to work with you, my son, as you make these valiant efforts to break down the barriers of the children who seek love, but know not how, whose minds are filled with inaccuracies and distortions, and yet their souls long for this gift. I will be with you, my son, and help you to speak the words of truth in ways that they may understand and accept. 

I am with you, my children, as you continue to do the Father’s work and be the messengers of love and truth. I am with you and my love and prayers go out to you always, beloveds. God bless you. I am Jesus. God bless you.
