The world is in need of you, all of you, and many more of you for how is this Truth to come to the world if there are not those who carry this Truth with strength and faith, who are brave and strong in the Love of God. You see about you many lost souls, souls who go about their business but are completely unawares of their deep need for Love and God and Truth. They are asleep, my beloveds, they are asleep. God will wake up the souls in ways that they will have a deep need and desire to know Truth. This is God's plan for the salvation of mankind and this plan is being activated now and will continue to be activated in the future. God needs you, my beloved friends. God needs all souls in this world who are themselves awakened by Love, who are true to the simple truths of God and His creation.

You must continue to pray earnestly, to redouble your efforts in prayer and continue to seek for the awakening of your souls ever more beautifully and powerfully so that you may be channels of Love, leaders of Light, purveyors of Truth, beacons in the world. For who will go out into the world if not those souls that God has nurtured and carried in Light and brought them to a place of awakening, strengthened them in many ways through their life's experience, through the tests and trials that each soul who is earnest continues to endure as the steel is tempered in the fire, as the Love continues to burn away all those conditions within them that are not of Love and in harmony with God's Laws of Love.

Yes, my beloved souls, you continue to be challenged and you continue to walk in faith. We see your Light. We know what you are capable of. We know you better than you know yourselves. And I say to you, each one of you have many gifts and strengths and abilities and possibilities that you are unaware of, that continue to emerge within your souls. These awakenings come day by day as you grow in the Love, as you pray for the blessings of God upon you. This is not an easy path, my beloved souls. It continues to challenge all those parts of you that are of the human condition and beseeches you to be strong, to choose Light, to be in harmony with God. It is the power of the Divine Love entering your soul that gives you the impetus and the ability to change and grow and bring greater Light and harmony within. Listen to these yearnings within you. Listen to God's promptings as He guides you along on your journey of awakening and truly understanding yourselves and the Truth of God's creation. In this comes profound wisdom and profound strength and wondrous, wondrous joy as the Love of God works its miracle within you as you continue to open and flower in the Light of God's Love.

This is a magnificent journey, is it not? This is a wondrous, wondrous opportunity to awaken in Love, to truly understand the power of Love, to express Love, to teach Love, to emulate Love in every way. Beloved souls, God needs you. God encourages you to step forth. God desires for you to be His channels of Love, His beacons of Light in the world. May you fulfill your destinies to be that beacon and channel. May you be strong enough to take up the challenge and to be that higher self, that aspect of you that is your soul resplendent in Love, expressed through every part of your being. God will ensure that you have every opportunity, every benefit, every blessing, everything that is required for you to come to that place of purity and strength and Love. Are we not all blessed, beloved souls, with such great and wondrous bounty that flows from the bosom of God to each one of us? We carry one another, beloveds, we walk together, we in the celestial kingdom, you who continue to grow and struggle in the world. We walk together and this shall be a wondrous journey, a wondrous journey.

My love is with you, beloveds. My prayers are with you. The prayers of many angels continue to be directed to God for your benefits. May you know this, truly know that you are loved and cared for, that God's Hand rests firmly upon you. May the peace that passes all understanding be yours, my beautiful, beautiful friends. May you come to know all the wonders of this journey, all the blessings that God has to give. God bless you and keep you in His Light. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you. God bless you.
