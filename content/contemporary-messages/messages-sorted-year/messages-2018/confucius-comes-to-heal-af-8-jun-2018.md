Â 

I am Confucius. I will be in charge of healing for each one of you and those who are coming. I will attempt to bring to you healing energies that you require for your betterment. I am blessed and happy to serve you in this way, beloved souls, for when you come together in such a circle of Light, you draw to you many blessings, many gifts to help uplift and to help you to unburden yourselves, physically, emotionally, within your minds. As the blessing of the Divine Love flows into you, so it heals your souls, your souls that carry all those conditions and experiences of your life that are not in harmony with Love shall be released by Love. As it flows into your souls, so it pushes forward and away these conditions that affect you but do not enhance your life. It opens the way for God to be within you and with this awareness of God, you will find peace and Truth. And so you enter a journey to Light, greater Light, beautiful Light. God bless you beloveds, God bless you.
