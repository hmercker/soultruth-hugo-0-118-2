Received by Al Fike


The world is opening to you now in your lives. God has made this possible. You will come to many different places in this world and bring the Light and Truth of God’s Love. This message is meant to be given and shared with many. 

I ask you, beloved souls, that you may indeed open yourselves to these possibilities, to not place before you any restrictions or concerns or ideas as to where God will take you in the times to come, but to live each day in the flow and beauty of God’s Will and Love for you. These matters will indeed be taken care of by God and His angels. You will be guided and you will be carried. Be at peace, my beloveds. Be in the Light of God’s Love always, and in this Light, all good and beautiful blessings will come to each one of you, beloved souls. God bless you. I am Andrew, God bless you.
