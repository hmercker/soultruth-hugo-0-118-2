You are all awakening, my beloveds. Each of you in some way has been asleep. Parts of your souls which are eager to awaken shall now come to life. Those perceptions and understandings that you have longed for my beloveds, are coming to you now, in openings subtle yet powerful, in awarenesses deep and infused with Love. You are awakening my beloveds. God is calling you from your slumbers to a place of acute awareness and powerful Love. 

Much awaits you beloveds in these times which are so very close, with shifts and openings, true awareness and understandings which are bubbling forth from your souls. Can you not feel the change, the depth that is coming into your consciousness as you come closer to God, as you come to truly love yourselves, as you come to truly love one another and all those in your lives, all those in this world? These are the signs of the awakenings, beloved souls. It is your capacity to love, it is those feelings deep within you that bring joy and a depth and steadfastness within you that knows that this is truly the Light within your soul. Walk in this Love. Express yourselves in this Love. See the world through this Love and be in the world as God's Channels of Love. You awaken my beloved beautiful friends. Like the bird perched on a branch and which begins to flutter its wings to seek to go higher, to be in the air, the air filled with Light. So you soar ever upwards, closer to God and your souls sing in joy and praises, recognizing the beauty of your own creation and the beauty of all of God's Creation. So you awaken and you shall learn to fly as easily as you breathe my beloveds. You shall come close to God, fluttering in the Light of His Presence, knowing with the eyes of your soul, being in that wondrous, joyful state of recognition, with your souls alive and enlivened by Love. 

My beloveds, the angels walk with you, never to leave, always accompanying their charges along the path to Love and Light and awakening and joy. God bless you my beloveds. I am Andrew and I love you, each one so precious and beautiful in God's Sight, each soul a Light in the world. You are loved. You are Love and may this Love continue to flow through you and all about you and within you recreating and bringing new Light to your being. God bless you. God bless you my beloveds. I love you.
