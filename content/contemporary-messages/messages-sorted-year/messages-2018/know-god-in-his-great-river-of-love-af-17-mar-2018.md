I am Tahlia and I once lived in the Incan empire many years ago. I have a particular connection with you, my daughter and I work with you. You will feel my power. You will feel the energies that come through me and through you as you continue your work in this world to help peoples to heal and to come to Truth and to guide them in the world. You will know me. You will know me.

We will work together to bring the Truth of God's Love in this world. Many angels work with you, all of you here, all who are willing. All who are with God will have many angels working through them and will bring many blessings, many events that will change the lives of others in unforeseen ways, that will bring harmony and Truth and Love. According to your personalities and the Laws of Attraction and Rapport, these angels will come close. As your gifts grow and the openings within your souls start to emerge and become clear to you and as the gift of sight comes, the gift of knowing your God, your Heavenly Father, comes to you. So you will find those angels who will dedicate themselves to you, not merely for your betterment but for the betterment of others through you.

These gifts will come through with such strength and such beauty that you will not deny them nor will others, whether it be healing, perception, giving guidance and Truth, uplifting others in Love, or clearing the dark conditions away from those who are eager to change and to come further into the Light. God will use you in many ways. God needs you in many ways. For who will carry the Light, who will carry the torch to guide the brothers and sisters out of the darkness? It must be those who are strong, those who know the way, those who carry the Love. You may think that your life is an interesting journey as it is, but I tell you the interesting part is coming, the surprises, the awakenings and the openings, are coming. This is just the beginning for each one of you. For when the time comes that God says: *“It is time to work, to set forth, to show the way, to light the way”,* and you will be ready. God is preparing each one of you and you are beginning to recognize those things within you that have been hidden but will emerge, possibilities and potentials that come unbidden but flourish in the Light of God's Love. This is not something that you must consciously create. It does not require that kind of work to make it real. It comes with prayer. It comes with your eager connection with God. When you feel that wondrous, awakened, awareness of the Touch of God, many things flow and much comes in this flow.

So wade into the river, the river of God's Love. As you go deeper, as the depth of that river is beyond your own height and you make that tentative step to push away from the shore and be carried by the river, to float in this wondrous condition of Love, God's Presence will be with you and He will take you to many places. You will journey to many awakenings, understandings and soulful knowings. It is a journey for those who are faithful and strong enough to let go and allow this flow to take them where it must. In this way you will know God's Will, for God's Will is within this journey. God will awaken you. You will find that true self that resides within you. All those thoughts and ideas, all those ambitions and perspectives of the mind will be drowned in the river, let go, like stones falling to the bottom and thus you will be more buoyant. The river will carry you ever more swiftly to a destination that never comes, for it is the journey, my friends, the journey that is all important. Do not stand on the bank looking upon this river. Be strong and brave and wade deep within. You will not be harmed. Nor will you be lost. Instead, you will find the journey you have all been seeking, the journey of the soul.

As your soul becomes awakened, being washed by these waters, cleansed and strengthened, filled with Light, you will have no need for that old life clinging to the rocks. You will merely let go in joyful abandon and loving recognition that you will be like a fish in the river, carrying you along. This is your home now. This is where you belong. May that Love that rains upon you touching your soul, being absorbed by your thirsty soul, compel you to dive in, to be at one with Love, to trust in the power of Love, the current of Love, the beauty of Love. Let go now, my friends, let yourself drift and drink and know God in His great river of Love.

God bless you, my beloved, beloved friends. Join me in Love. I am Tahlia and I swim with you, all of you. Follow yourselves to the Light of God's Love. God bless you.
