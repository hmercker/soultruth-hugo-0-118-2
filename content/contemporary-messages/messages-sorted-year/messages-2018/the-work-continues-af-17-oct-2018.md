God bless you, I am Thomas Aquinas. I wish to thank my dear charge for his efforts, his deep and sincere prayers, his desire to grow in God’s Love, to release all conditions that are not of Love. He has made great progress, great progress in this regard and his intentions to sustain this are admirable and will be blessed by our support and efforts to keep him in close connection with you all and in close connection with God. 

It is our desire beloveds, it is our thought and our intentions, to bring these blessings to you and it is important to be focused and strong in your efforts and prayer in creating harmony and love amongst you. You have learned many lessons in this regard. You have accomplished many things by breaking down the barriers between you and between you and God. May you continue in these ways, in this way of prayer, of faith, of trust, of desire and longing.  Knowing your souls, my friends, knowing your souls is of the upmost importance at this time in your lives. That all barriers that prevent you from this awakening may continue to dissolve in love. 

Keep yourselves dedicated to God, to your relationship with His great Soul that nourishes and awakens you my friends. We continue to serve together, to grow together, to pray together, and though my beloved charge will not be here in the flesh, he will be here with you in his spirit and the chain will not be broken. The circle will continue to be infilled with each of you present and the work will continue as we together make our efforts and prayers. So the blessings shall pour upon you all and bring you into greater light, greater awakening, a depth of knowing, seeing, hearing, being in the flow and alignment with the Father’s Love.

We continue my friends, we continue. God bless you, I am Thomas. God bless you.
