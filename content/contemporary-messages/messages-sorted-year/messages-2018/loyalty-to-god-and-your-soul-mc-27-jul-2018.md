# Loyalty to God and Your Soul

God bless you, I am Keea-Atta Kem and I come to give you a message as you move forward with your preparations for the time when you will come together for your continued efforts with direct voice.  

You continue with your weekly prayer time, your weekly appointment. This is excellent as in this time there is much that we do while we have your attention and focus and your prayerful states receiving the great blessing of God’s Divine Love. As it is through the attainment of this Love in your souls that this gift will come into realization, we in spirit who have longed for many years to speak with our own voice and manifest before mankind, will have this great opportunity. We so greatly appreciate every effort that you continue to make.

We would like to encourage you to continue you in the way that you do to let one another know when you are praying outside of those times of your weekly appointment, as currently there are a few of you drawn together. As you do this you draw in your circle of seven, there may be some in the sleep state, and we ask that you continue to make your efforts in this way as well throughout your week. It is very important, this time is very important in your preparations for coming together in the short time ahead.

My dears, this circle of seven, this strengthened bond that continues to build amongst you, this soul connection is of the highest order. We see your great efforts that you are making physically, mentally and spiritually. Each time that you reach to God asking for help the answers come, the help comes.  

Bring into your awareness as much as you can, as often as you can throughout your day, a connection with God. It is a worthy cause, a worthy effort to strive to be connected with God at all times. It is a lifetime process. It is not something that you will do for this week or until these gifts are realized, no my children. It is an effort that one can make for all eternity. We teachers who come to you are constantly connected to our Heavenly Father. So your guidance is to make your effort to have a constant communion with your beloved Creator. The One who will guide you, who bestows the wisdom and the truths in your soul, the One who gifts you, the One who provides for your needs, the One who protects you and cares for you, the One who has created you. My beloveds, this is the most important connection, friendship that one can develop. Become so close to your beloved Creator elevating you in every way possible. This is the deep guidance that is required, that is given. The effort, your effort to be so close to your beloved Creator having a soul to Soul connection and awareness of this, at all times.

My dearly beloved brothers and sisters, this is what will bring forward this gift of direct voice, receiving the blessing of God’s Love upon your soul and having the deepest relationship with God.  Please do your best to keep this in mind as you move forward in coming together. It is vital at this time that your efforts come into a singleness of purpose for the gift of direct voice.  

We see you moving through your recent challenge to let go of judgments, to be aware the many times that you are in judgment and as our beloved teacher (Seretta Kem<sup>1</sup>) was suggesting, it is a noble exercise and one to help to strengthen you. It is so important that you are aware of your mental diet and the way in which this part of you inhibits your closeness to God and inhibits the closeness of your teachers, guides, your angel friends, inhibits their ability also to come close to you, piercing through these mental blocks that you are so readily and habitually challenged by. Yes my dear friends we ask you to elevate, to step up your game so to speak. Each of you knows the way in which you are required to make your efforts. Stop fooling yourselves. You do not fool God, you do not fool us, it is only yourselves that you fool. These words may sound direct and may sound harsh, more so I hope that they sound clear.  

Focus on your loyalty. To what are you loyal, to whom are you loyal? Be loyal to God, be loyal to your soul and all other matters will receive this benefit. First and foremost, be loyal to God and to be loyal to your souls for your souls know what is the purpose that is unfolding. God knows what is the purpose He desires to unfold through you. Commit, commit to this loyalty, commit to that deep place inside of you, that knowing, the truth, the wisdom, the joy. Commit to this place giving it an expression in your life, allowing your soul to be the part of you that guides, directs and drives you here on Earth. Come to know your souls beloveds, this most precious, precious place within you. Spend time each day giving this place within you a voice. Sit with yourselves in the quiet and stillness and come into a relationship with this part of you. It is the only way. You must make an effort to know this part of you, allowing it to infiltrate and inform every part of you. Trust this wisdom. If some of you find this challenging, this is excellent because then that is the place you know you need to continue to go to. It is an exercise that is worth your time and effort. When the gift of direct voice is realized, it is through your soul that your life will be guided and will need to be guided, allowing it to inform your mind as to what is the next right step. Your soul’s guidance comes from God. And us, your teacher and angel friends, also commune with you on a soul level.

There is still much to do when we will come together in a very short time. My dear friends, it is my great hope and encouragement to you that you deepen your commitment to this gift, this gift of direct voice. That you now again, become ever more vigilant with the awareness of how your day does unfold. When you go about and are caught up in your everyday tasks that can distract you, I am not saying that these are not important, but when you are caught in the throes of these mindless activities, bring God into them. Be in a silent prayer continuously; bring God into everything that you are doing. This is the way, this is the way.

My love is very deep for you and we, your angel band circle of seven and many others, the entire Celestial Kingdom, is dedicated and committed to bringing this gift forward.  We need your dedication, my beloved brothers and sisters, we need your dedication.  Though there are many distractions in this Earth life it is something you have committed to, you have committed to God, to one another.  Be loyal my friends, be loyal to God and to your souls.

God bless each and every one of you and thank you for taking this, these words of encouragement and love and clarity, thank you for taking it to heart. Thank you for your loyalty, your commitment and dedication. I love you, God bless each of you. I am Keea-Atta Kem, I love you.
