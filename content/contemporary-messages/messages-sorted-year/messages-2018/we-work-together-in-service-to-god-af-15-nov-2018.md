Â 

I am your earthly friend James<sup>1</sup> and I will continue to be with you in your prayer vigils together. And I am so happy to see the three of you together. If I were still on the earth, I would have loved to have joined you in this circle of spiritual men. I wish I could tell you of my journeys, how wonderful and how awesome in nature have been my experiences while progressing in the spheres of spirit. Beloved, beloved friends, I want you to know, that there are many, many things awaiting each one of you when that time comes to pass. I will be there to greet you, each one, as will be many spirits and angels, who will want to welcome you into the greater life of spirit.

I see you have a deep desire to make plans to reach out to your brothers and sisters, to assist them, that they may have the clarity of this truth. I want you to know that your desires are not misplaced, that your efforts will come to fruition, given patience and persistence, and that there are many on my side of life working to help open doors and bring possibilities forward in your work. 

The light that is around you, my friends, is great and is powerful. This light penetrates into the dark spheres of spirit, into the deep spheres of darkness and the greyness and those even of light. You see, you cause great interest and curiosity from many spheres and many spirits who inhabit these spheres. In fact as your life continues in service and prayer, a great deal of the work that you do is in bringing greater truth to these spirits. For you reside in a very fortuitous plane of existence in this regard, that many can be reached through your instrumentalities and your efforts to pray, to be together. I dare say and I do not wish to inhibit you, but I dare say that even your conversations are overheard by many, many spirits who are curious to what you say. 

So my friends, each moment is an opportunity to serve God, to be a channel of truth. Consider your words, consider the truth that you speak and how this reverberates out to many others, whom of course you are not aware of, nor do you need to be, but they are present nonetheless. 

My friends, know that we surround you in light, that we continue our work together in the great effort that God is making to cleanse this world of darkness, to bring the peace and harmony and joy and love that every soul on your world is entitled to receive and know. You are a part of a plan, its scope is vast and complex, and each of us, whether in spirit or in the flesh, play a part and in this effort that we make in dedication to our love to God, we will all know a great joy and the great benefits of spiritual blessings poured upon us for our efforts and through us in our efforts to serve God and to serve humanity. 

My brothers, many work with you and many seek to work through you and as long as your desire is for the highest and many beautiful gifts nand blessings will manifest through you. Know that every life continues upon the journey, a process of awakening and growing. You have gleaned much truth and knowledge in your lives and this helps deeply in your growth and direction and ability to serve and speak the truth. 

My friends, your brother James is with you. God bless you. It is a gift to assist you in your efforts and in your growth of the soul. God bless you. God bless you. Your friend James, is never far away. 



**Note 1** I (Geoff Cutler) consider James a very special friend and we spent many happy hours talking about spiritual things and praying together. Sadly as he lived in Queensland I did not see him and his lovely wife as often as I might have liked. He had only recently passed over as of this date.
