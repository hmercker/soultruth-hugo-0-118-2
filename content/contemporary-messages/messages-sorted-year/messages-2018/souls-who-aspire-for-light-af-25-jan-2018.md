# Souls Who Aspire for Light Shall Bring the Change

January 25<sup>th</sup>, 2018

First United Spiritualist Church, Burnaby, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

 

The Love of God shall spread in the world from the souls who aspire for Light. They will bring the change and this change is coming, beloveds. Prepare your souls, be open to this great blessing of Love. You shall usher in an era of peace in this world through the power of this grace that comes from God. Walk on this road and you shall know the joy of an awakened soul and shall know God and be in the flow of His Love and Light. It is your gift from God. It is your choice to receive and to know this gift. 

Beloved souls, you are blessed. You are in this Light. God has prepared a place for you in this sanctuary. Come and pray and know His Presence here and you shall not be disappointed but will know a deep communion with the Heavenly Father.
Be at peace, beloved souls, and know that you are loved, loved beyond measure, loved in the grace of God's pure blessing to you.

God bless you. I am Peter. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
