# Seek the Love That Will Carry You Through the Changes

February 24<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Hollis Woods Community Church, Queens, New York, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike.

Â 

This place will be a refuge for you, my beloveds, in times to come. For there is great change coming to this world and there are times when you will need one another, and you will need the comfort of God in your lives. I urge you to band together in community, to work together to help the many souls who will be in need, who will be confused and distraught. 

For the world is changing and the world is beginning to heal from the conditions that humanity has brought. The clouds will clear my beloveds. The pain will end, and the Truth will be made clear to every soul willing to listen. You must find within your hearts great strength and Love that will carry you through the changes that are coming and help you to see clearly the road you must follow that will bring harmony, not only to you in your lives but to many others.

Your souls seek this, beloveds. Your souls seek to be in the flow of Light. Listen, listen to that deep desire within. Seek to be open to what God has to give to you. Awaken yourselves so that God may use you as a channel of Love in the world. 

Each of you walks a different path. Each of you sees differently the world, but together you have great vision and deep awareness, and this shall deepen and strengthen as you continue to grow within your souls and awaken to that part of you that continues to desire to grow and to become formed in Love. 
Listen to your hearts, beloved souls and know that God hears your prayers and your longings. You shall be blessed and those you love shall be blessed and those that are coming shall be blessed. God will touch all who so desire to be in the Light.

God bless you. I am John the Beloved and I love you. I love you. God bless you.
