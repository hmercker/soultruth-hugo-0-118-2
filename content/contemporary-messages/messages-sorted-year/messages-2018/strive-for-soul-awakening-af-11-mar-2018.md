Â 

I wish to encourage you upon your path and your efforts to receive the gift of direct voice. You have been blessed in many ways while you have been together in this place.

Your efforts have been worthwhile. Your work continues to grow and the development of this gift inches closer to reality in this world. You must continue to make efforts together in prayer, to designate those times in prayer, no matter where you are in the world, utilize your time in this way. It is important to come together in a serious way, a committed way, in prayer. It is very important. And to continue to strive towards the integration of your mind and your soul to that place of harmonious blending and fusion, so that you may be closer to us, that you may more readily work with us for the manifestations which we wish to bring forth.

As you are well aware, it requires considerable prayer and effort to receive the Father's Love in order to bring forth this integration, this transformation of your consciousness, so that we may communicate and have a stronger rapport with you and be closer to God. This is your next step. This is the most important goal of your lives at this moment, to put aside the dominance of your material mind in favour of the harmonization of these two minds within you. For within your souls, the capacity, the faculties and the power of the Love within you will bring about a radical transformation of your consciousness. You have been prepared for this and you are close to this goal. It is our hope that when you come together once more in this way that you will be in that important stage of consciousness, of awareness. It is not that far off, it is not that far off. But it does require your commitment and your effort and prayer. It requires your discipline in taming your unruly material minds and changing those patterns which often set you off course from the realization of a deep spirituality and awakening of your soul.

In the world but not of the world, my friends. Yes you have heard this often. It is required that you are closer to God than you are to the conditions of mankind. You continue to walk in this direction, to strive for the highest and to allow those vexing conditions of the mind to be allayed by the Love within your soul. You are stronger than you think, my beloveds and you are closer than you think. You feel it when you are together in prayer. You recognize the power of the Love within you. You feel the Touch of God upon you. You feel close to the angels who are with you. Is it not far away, you are not distant from this wondrous flow. In reality, that is the awakening of your souls and the acceptance that comes from all parts of your being so that it may be integrated and become one harmonious whole within you, a wondrous example of the Light, an indication of the power of the redemptive Love of God.

So we thank you for your efforts. As our brother Jesus has indicated, you have a special place within our hearts, this small group dedicated and sincere, earnest and pure of faith. May you continue to grow in the Father's Love, walk this path that God has laid before you and to be true to your souls, true to that eternal place within you that continues to grow bright and enlightened by Love. We will never leave you, my beloveds. Continue in your efforts to bring about your individual transformations and your collective efforts to bring this gift forward. They go hand in hand, my beloveds, hand in hand. So you must, with each day, dedicate yourselves to this awakening and transformation so that you may fulfill your purpose in this world, what God wishes for you to do. Do you have a glimpse of what you are meant to do, my beloveds? Do you understand the importance of your efforts? Do you not see that what you have dedicated yourselves towards is a very rare and beautiful dedication to God? Thus you have the attention of the angels. You have a blessing from God to bring this forth.

I know you may crave acknowledgement of your brothers and sisters in this world. I say to you, you are seen and known and loved and acknowledged by those whith eyes to see, those who have great Love within their souls, those who truly understand what it is that your souls crave for and that is to serve God in Love, to be a Light in this world, to bring change and healing to this world. You are seen, beloved souls. See yourselves, see one another and honour one another in Love.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am Seretta Kem and we will come together again to continue these prayers and in some day, hopefully some day soon, you will go forth in the world demonstrating the Truths of God's Love, bringing many souls to the awakening of this potential, showing the way with your wisdom, the Love within you, the compassion that you have for your brothers and sisters, serving God with every breath and every step you take. It is not so far away. It is close. May you continue to make the efforts that you are aware of and must be made. Be in the Light always, beloved souls. We thank you and we bless you for this time you have taken in love. We are with you. I am your servant Seretta Kem and I love you. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. We are with you.
