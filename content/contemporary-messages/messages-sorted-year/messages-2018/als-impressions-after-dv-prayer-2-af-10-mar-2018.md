# Al’s Impressions after DV Prayer

March 10<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by A.F.

 

The angels were behind us and then these two rings merge together. They are quite tall, they are all quite tall. Well, Lotus Blossom was not the tallest one. In reality, she's about what, five foot something or four foot something.

Anyway, I don't know how they can do this physically but they did, they stepped forward and they joined hands and they were with us, like merged with us, joining hands. When they did that, we just went shhhhew, right up. I wondered, maybe that's how they do it, they get us up there, by doing this little joining hands and away we go. That's the first time I've seen that, I just wanted to share that.

J1: I felt all that physical manifestation, they were merged, they were more than overshadowing, they were manipulating from the inside out. 

Our guides with each one of us and the golden, I would call it the golden ring, so I saw our golden ring and I saw their golden ring and it was like they brought it together. They were almost merging or overshadowing each one of us. I could see, I could sense each purpose, how what I was talking about yesterday or the day before about these sashes and all that stuff.

I sort of got a deeper insight but I can't really explain what I saw but I got a deeper insight as to what that meant. I also got the understanding as how they can work with us in this condition compared to the dark room, that this merging that they are doing allows them to see more clearly into our physical bodies and all the layers of us and work with that through their perceptions and their gifts and what not. So the dark room isn't necessary anymore. Something was established there that they are now using and can continue to use in our development. So they don't need the special conditions, special physical conditions. But they are appreciating the conditions that are here, something about the air and the sea. It's kind of flushing out the human conditions, I don't know.

So that was lovely. And then I got into this deep kind of perception and vision of the condition of the world. The sense I got is that everybody is so tired and that the world is so tired, that the enthusiasm for life, the vitality for life is being drained away by the conditions of this world and what we are making ourselves go through. I kind of realized how lucky we are that we can actually detach ourselves to a certain extent from that condition, but it still holds onto us. I really felt it in me. I felt like it was like sand in my brain or something, something kind of heavy and I could see how I am motivated to be distracted and everybody else is the same from that heaviness by all the distractions that we create for ourselves in life and all the distractions that everybody creates for themselves in life. People spend huge amounts of money to go on these holidays and do this and do that and all the other things. It's because we are all running away from the condition of reality that we have created in this life. That's our job, it is to break it. It's not just us, it's others as well as us. I kind of had a sense that the reason why things are going to fall apart, the reason why the world is going to change, the reason why everything is kind of coming up now is to break the cycle and to bring life back.

So it seemed kind of heavy. I felt kind of sad about how humanity has created these conditions and we are all asleep. They said in our souls we are awake but in our minds we're still asleep. When they keep saying get beyond this, merge your mind with your soul and all that - that's what they are talking about, that we continue - it's not our fault, I mean this is the pervasive condition of this planet. It's very, very difficult to be removed from it. We do, we get those moments, we get those moments in prayer, we get sometimes just moments when we awaken. Yeah, you were talking about waking up and feeling joy and all that. That's how our normal condition should be. That's what is meant for humanity, to awaken, to be in the world and to be alive and joyful. That's what's meant to be for the world, for everybody in the world. That's our message. But we have to live it, we have to be it. We grumble about the weather, whatever you know. There's lots of things we grumble about because we want to be taken away from the reality or the sense of that and to be happy, to be joyful in our own soul, in our own soul, in our own being, in our own minds.

So the challenge remains for us to go beyond that condition that keeps getting reinforced day in and day out, 24 hours a day it's here. The mist - I saw the clouds, the mist is everywhere. It's like you can't get away from it really, only in prayer, only with that effort and that work to rise above it. So it takes our conscious, willful effort, prayerful application of the Truth in the ways that we know to go beyond it. When we see ourselves entering into those old patterns, it's because the energies, the conditions of this world hold us there. We keep getting pulled back, we keep getting pulled back and this again is the need for strength and for discipline and to recognize what's going on.

J1: That sure makes it clear why we are here.

Yeah, so we're getting a bit of a holiday but even here you know we tend to pull ourselves back into dynamics and you know thoughts and all of that that are not of joy, you know. I didn't feel like spirit was condemning us or blaming us or anything. They are just saying that this is how it is, we understand this is how it is, we are trying to help you, we're trying to help you every moment. I got a feeling that more we get to that place beyond, the easier it gets. It's like the more you reinforce it, the easier it gets. But we have to make that conscious effort to go there, you know. It's not, it's a 24-7 job. It does you know when you put it that way it kind of feels like oh I really got this responsibility of work, I can't indulge myself in my old patterns and all that stuff. Maybe that's the case, maybe that's why they say you have to be strong. I don't know but it really you know - this experience I had really reinforced so much of the messages that have been coming through of late regarding elevating our condition, that this is our challenge right now. This is why we don’t  - they said as soon as you are there, the gift of direct voice will just come, it will kind of just go plunk. Like it won't require anything more, but that's the challenge right now, that's why we’re -  it hasn't come through in the way that we thought because we made it another one of those distractions. You know we've made it *“Oh this is something to be excited about, this is something that takes us away from that condition that we all carry to one degree or another.”* We see it differently, we experience it differently, our lives, the expression of it is different in each of our lives but it's there and pervasive.

We're a little further along than a lot of other people in the world. I mean we are waking up, you know, we're getting insights. We wake up and then we go back. We wake up and then we go back.

G: If we weren’t further along, we'd all be wasting our time, wouldn't we?

Yeah, we do need to be further along and we are, what we are doing is working but we can kind of ease, or make it easier for ourselves by not working too hard, just working enough. Staying in that stuck place which is what it felt like for everybody, we're all kind of stuck at this, you know, this greyness.
J1: I just wanted to cocoon and be in prayer and be in our bubble! Sorry.

If we do it that way, we'll make slow progress but we won't get there. It's got to be a little more dynamic and we have to kind of amp it out as we go along.

G: We have to operate in the world and be able to handle the conditions of the world.

Yeah, in the world but not of the world.

G: So it's no good falling back and saying I want nothing to do in the world because in the end we have to deliver in the world.

All these people in our lives that don't have what we have, they are dealing with this. So you have got to have compassion for what they're dealing with. Gary is dealing with it. Bill is dealing with it. Our children are dealing with it. All these people are dealing with this and they don't have, or at least in a conscious way they are not utilizing the tools that we understand, to have to try to neutralize it, so you can't, you can't judge because it's just so pervasive and what they are able to do without this strength that we are building within ourselves, you have to have a bit of admiration for their tenacity and to try to stay positive and live their life in a good way.
