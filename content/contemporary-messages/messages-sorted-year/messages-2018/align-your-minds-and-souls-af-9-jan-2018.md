God bless you beloveds, I am Confucius. My beautiful little birds, how you love to flock together. How eager you are to continue your journey and to grow in Love. I say to you my beloved beautiful birds, souls of a feather, you are progressing in Love. Your souls continue to expand and grow. It is for you to align your minds and souls together. This is your challenge at this time. To walk in this harmony that is the integration of both aspects of yourselves so that the Love of your soul may inform the thoughts of your mind and that the thoughts of your mind may be an expression of the wisdom of your souls. God pours His Love, His blessings, His guidance, His insights within you and you absorb each experience, each thread and drop of Light. You bring it into yourselves and you must hold it dear. Meditate upon what God gives you and bring yourself into full alignment with God’s Will and Plan. 

It will not be long my beloveds and you will be walking on this earth with great strides and steps. You will be a powerful channel of His Love and Truth that continues with each day. And yes, it would be good to write your perceptions and Truth to share in whatever way is possible your love, your wisdom, to bring peace wherever you go, my beloveds, and harmony and to walk as a child of God that is truly within the flow of His Love.

May His blessings continue to pour upon you beloved souls and bring you into at-onement with God. As you fly together within this Light, soaring ever upwards, soaring ever closer to the Source of all, know that you are in God’s grasp. That though you feel, you strive and flutter above to come to that at-onement, it is God that lifts you my beloveds, it is God that lifts you, for you are in His hands. My precious birds perched upon Him as He carries you forth in Light.

Be in His precious sight. Know that you are blessed and carried and loved beyond measure. God bless you beloveds. Confucius loves you, is with you. God bless you.
