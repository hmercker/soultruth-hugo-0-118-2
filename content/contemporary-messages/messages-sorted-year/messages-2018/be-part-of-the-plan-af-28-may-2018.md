God’s Plan for the salvation of mankind envelops you all, my beloveds, and all those who are willing and eager to be a part of this Plan, the unfolding of God’s Will in this world, bringing the blessings of Love and upliftment, dispersing the darkness and bringing Light. You are a part of many and you will work together in this way. You just begin this journey, beloved souls. This great association of souls of Light and Truth that is coming together and coalescing into a beautiful movement that shall indeed push back the darkness and bring Truth, compassion, Love, comfort and many blessings. 

Continue to pray that you may be used as an instrument of God’s Will with each day and indeed those prayers will be answered. Each step forward will bring you to a higher place of knowing and being a channel of Love in this world. Each day my beloveds, each day, a blessing, a moving forward in Light and a channel of Love, clearing, widening and being a mighty flow for your brothers and sisters. You are blessed my beloveds. You continue to be blessed. God’s Hand is surely upon you and shall never leave you. You are not alone. You are with God and you are surrounded by His Angels, His Gift of Love to you, my beloveds, His Gift of Love. I am Jesus and I bless you my beloved, beautiful friends upon your journey, the continuing awakening of your souls through the Father’s Love. God bless you. My love is with you beloved souls. My love is with you. God bless you.
