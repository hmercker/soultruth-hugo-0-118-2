# We Will be With You

September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Phoenix, AZ, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike

Â 

It is not easy to walk in these conditions with so many who are so psychically gifted.<sup>1</sup> There are many there who will take as much as they give. You must be careful to guard your own condition, to not open too wide to those who you may be impressed with, with their gifts, but who are not so spiritually inclined. This is the dilemma of the gifted souls.  They manifest physical gifts but do not know their own souls. It is for you, beloveds, to discern this when you are with others. It is a test and it is an opportunity to learn. 

We will be with you, beloveds. Continue to pray for the cloak of protection around you and continue to be inspired, for you are indeed meant to connect and to approach many. This is part of your work, part of your task for God.

Remember, we are always here to support and uphold you, beloveds. Keep us with you in your consciousness and prayers and you will be protected. God bless you beloveds, God bless you. Confucius loves you. You are my little birds and I keep you in my nest of love, beloveds.
