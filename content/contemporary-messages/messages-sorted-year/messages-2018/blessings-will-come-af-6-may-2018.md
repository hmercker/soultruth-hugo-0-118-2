I am Mark and I am guardian of this church. God has given me this blessing and I take on this responsibility gladly and with love, for this is a place of Light. This is a place of refuge, and sanctuary for those who wish to come and share their understandings and their love and fellowship with one another. 

God pours His Blessings upon you my beloved, beloved friends. He lifts up this place for you. May you be open and receptive to the blessings that God has to give to each one of you. May you come here in an attitude of prayer, a desire that your souls may be opened and that the great blessing of the Father’s Love may pour within you. May you awaken to this Truth and to this blessing. For the more you can bring this Love within you and shine this Light from you to one another in this beautiful place, the more these blessings will come, the more manifestations will come, the more God will bless you. As you build the Light, the Light attracts light. The Truth attracts truth, Love attracts love. Keep this in mind my friends. When you come here, come with an attitude to give Love and Light to your brothers and sisters who are a part of this fellowship. Come to give,  to pray and to learn the Truth and know God’s Love in your hearts. Yes, God has many blessings waiting for you, my friends. It is merely the response to your desires, what it is that you truly wish, that will bring these blessings forward. May you be gifted abundantly by God. May your lives be gifted abundantly by God and may you come to know God as a constant companion in your lives. 

God bless you, my friends. I am Mark and my love is with you. My love is with you in your efforts to bring greater Light to this place and to this world, for with the Law of Attraction when you so desire and you so pray for, there will come a response and a blessing. May you desire for the highest and come to know your own soul, awakened in love. God bless you, beloved. I am Mark and I walk with you. Bless you.
