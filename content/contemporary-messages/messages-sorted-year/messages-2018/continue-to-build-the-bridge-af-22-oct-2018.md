Alec here. Yes you can see, though the mind may harbour certain beliefs, if the soul is attuned and aligned to God, that the blessings of the Father’s Love continue to flow. We all take our twists and turns on this world of yours seeking truth, wrestling with our minds as to what is true and what is not. This struggle is universal in your world and so few are able to go beyond the insistence of the mind that brings you not necessarily to truth but error.

My friends, you are coming to a place which is beyond this struggle, your faith deepens and your heart soars in love. My friends, you will know the truth in all its clarity, purity and power. You will feel the power of God’s Love in your heart and you will walk in the Light of God’s Touch always. There is little for you to release in error and there is much for you to gain in love. Know that those of us in spirit that have known you, have prayed for you, have assisted you in your growth and awakening of the soul will not ever leave you but are committed to stand by you, to walk with you, to work with you in this great effort to bring the truth to mankind. In order to change the hearts of men from stone to love, from error to truth, from weakness to strength, so much needs to be done, so much can be done by those who are committed and dedicated to their alignment with God in His Love.  

Given this powerful bridge between your soul and the great Soul of God, all truth will flow, all love will manifest, and beautiful gifts of the spirit will be possible and manifest readily in the Light of God’s Touch. We struggled on earth to bring these gifts forward but I dare say that you understand more than we did, that you recognize that the power of love is what will bring the gifts that you desire and what we have desired in the past. These things will come as a natural outflowing of the growth and beauty of your souls, allowing God to use you in many different ways, expressing many different aspects and gifts of your soul that will bring beautiful blessings to others and powerful truth and great comfort to many. 
You will see my friends, you will see how Gods plan will work in each of your lives and bring about wondrous results, awesome and beautiful. All with the power of God’s Love, all as you recognize and embrace this Truth and are changed fundamentally changed within by this Love.

God bless you. Alec is with you. I have never left. God bless you.
