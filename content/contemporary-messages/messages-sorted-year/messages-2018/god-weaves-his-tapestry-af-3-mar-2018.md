I am Keea.  We are so pleased that you have come together to help reinforce the bonds of love that you share, to work together to bring the Truth of God`s Love to those who are interested in receiving this message.  You have worked well together beloved souls, in harmony and love, and we are pleased with your efforts. We continue to encourage you to spread the Truth of this Love wherever you go, whoever you are with.  If they have some interest, please speak this Truth.  Give love.  Be a Light in the world.

Yes we will help you to arrange your efforts to come together once more.  For it is important that you come to support and reinforce one another in your efforts in this Truth, to further strengthen your bonds and to be unified in Love.  For every moment is an opportunity to reinforce and to bring further development of your souls in Love.

Yes there are plans my beloved friends, plans, that God has laid forth that will involve all of you in the coming years and it is important that you establish this harmony together, this understanding of one another, this deep love and respect, awareness and acceptance. It is that unified approach that you build in your understandings and your conversations, through your desire and your prayers that will indeed bring many blessings forward through you as a channel of Love in this world.

You cannot stray very far from one another my beloveds, for the bonds that you carry together are strong and bring you close to each other.  No matter where you are in the world, these bonds sustain a Light, a nurturing flow, a loving acknowledgement which will help to sustain you all and bring further work forward as each of you comes to understand and to enact God`s Plan, His Will in this world.

You are blessed my beloveds.  Are you not blessed to have one another?  Such a great blessing from God, as He continues to build this web of Light in the world, weaving each of you into this tapestry that will be a message of Love for the world. You will all play your parts.  God will use your gifts.  God will help you to open further to what lies within you, in your hearts, your souls, these treasures of Love.  And you will find your way.  You will be clear in your direction, your focus and your efforts.

May you continue to grow in His Love, my beloved, beloved brothers and sisters and seek the Source that will open the doors for this service that is coming, these efforts that are needed, this plan that will be enacted through God’s Instruments in this world and in our world.  We will all come together beloved souls in a great wave of Light and Love, Truth and healing for the world.  This is coming.  Do not let your minds doubt this, but go to your souls which know this to be true and feel the power of this knowing, the joy of this acknowledgement that you are meant to work together for the advancement of the Kingdom of God through the blessing of His Divine Love.

May the Holy Spirit continue to touch your souls my beloveds and shape you into that beautiful person that you are meant to be, that God has created with such wondrous potential possibilities.  You are beautiful, each of you, beautiful Lights.  And your Light will shine.  You will see, beloved souls.  You will see. God bless you.  I am Keea and I love you.  God bless you.
