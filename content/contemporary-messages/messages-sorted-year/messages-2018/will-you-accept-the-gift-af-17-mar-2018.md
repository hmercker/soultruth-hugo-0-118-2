# Will You Accept the Gift of God’s Love?

I am your teacher Augustine. Yes, may you carry this Light with you wherever you go and the memories of these experiences together, which are foundational in your relationships with one another and will open the doors to many other experiences that you will share together in times to come.

There is a Plan, beloved souls. There is a Plan that God has to bring greater Light to this world, to utilize all those souls who are willing and receptive to being a channel of Love and to hearing the Will of God and following the Will of God in this world. Each of you have been called, each of you have the possibility and the potential to work in very effective ways to bring greater Light to this world. For many of you in the past, you have worked independently, have utilized your minds and created within you a spiritual awareness, your efforts to be educated, to understand the mechanics of the metaphysical world. But in many cases this did not include to any great degree the inclusion of God, the awareness of God. Yes some vague awareness possibly, some sense of God's Presence as your souls continued to seek your acknowledgement, your recognition of this relationship with God.

But it is our hope that you have now come to a clearer picture, a greater understanding of the importance of accentuating your relationship with God in whatever you do to serve and bring Light to this world. For in this relationship, everything that you do will be blessed and accentuated by this gift of Divine Love and by the budding awareness of your soul to know God's Will. At this time in your world God is putting a great deal of effort, pouring His Love and blessings into this world, calling all of those souls of Light to rise above the human condition, to come into greater rapport and connection with the Heavenly Father, so that you may understand, be in alignment with this Plan. You have felt the ease of which you are in the flow of God's Love while together. These many blessings that flow into you and upon you, this great Light that is created amongst you, this is a gift from God, for it is not your efforts insomuch as it is God's Blessing and the efforts of the angels that have created these conditions, have brought you together in this way and have made it possible to be in this situation, in this blessed arena of Light.

So, beloved souls, keep this in your consciousness, that there is a Plan. There is a purpose for each soul who is willing to put aside their own mental constructs and projections and egotistical ideas as to what they may do to serve God. Come to a place of humility, of listening and willingness to act in harmony with God's Desire and Guidance to step forward as a worker for Light as you call it, a channel of Love as we call it, to bring the changes that are required in this world. A world that is continuing to head towards chaos and darkness and thus to divert the momentum towards Light. Are you capable of this, beloved souls, capable alone to do this? No, you must band together and you must raise your eyes to God, to listen, for even if you were all together in unanimity, you could not change the world in this way. You do not have the power to do so, but if you come together in unanimity and in alignment with God you have multiplied the power and the possibilities for change exponentially. Thus you are being called. You are given the invitation to consider, to continue to explore the possibilities of your soul, to receive this gift of God's Love thereby attracting to you at all times the presence of an angel who will help you and guide you and work towards your soul's development and enrichment so that you may indeed hear the Will of God, know the Will of God, to act in the flow of God's Will. It is your choice, beloved souls.

For those who seek for more information, there is much available to you to understand things of which I am speaking, but in your hearts, that most precious place within you, you know what I say is true and something within you calls you forward to seek this precious connection with your Creator, to be awakened within you to this new reality and to be a part of the new day that dawns for humanity. God needs many workers, many who carry Light within, many who are wise and strong, compassionate and faithful. Are you willing? Do you have the desire to follow this Path, the Path that not only leads to the redemption of your soul but will in time lead to the redemption of mankind. 

As you walk day by day, as your prayers continue to intensify, as the Light of God's Love continues to grow within you, so the answers will come, the work will unfold, the possibilities will become evident as your soul awakens, as your eyes open and God peels the scales from your eyes, the illusions, the error, the misunderstandings, the hurts within and the conditions that are not of Light, all of these things God will bring to you and heal you from. This is God's Promise to you, beloved souls, that your needs will be taken care of. You will find your way and you will live a life free of fear, free of deep worry and concern, that of joy, that of awakening, that of Love, a Love so deep and pure and wondrous that when you look back to this day you will wonder why did I wait so long to come to this place where I am free, I am in the Light, I am with God?

It all awaits you, my beloveds. God awaits your choice. God awaits your prayers. God always loves you no matter what. It is for you to discover the wonderment of His Love. May the dawning awareness of your souls rise up into your conscious self and inform your choice. God awaits and God already knows, for He knows you more than you know yourself. Be in that consciousness of God, that consciousness where Love resides and Truth is clearly apparent to both your mind and your souls. So many gifts await you, my beloveds, so many blessings. It is yours for the asking.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your teacher Augustine. My love and blessings are with you as you journey forth. God bless you.
