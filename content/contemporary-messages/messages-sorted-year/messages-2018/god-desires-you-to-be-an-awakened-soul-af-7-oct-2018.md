I am with you beloveds, always, and indeed it can be. Given your efforts, desires, prayers, actions, thoughts, motivations to be in alignment with God, to be in harmony with His laws of love, and to continue to allow your souls to awaken and emerge as a conscious part of you. You now understand that the reason for you to come together is in mutual support for the awakening of your souls in deeper measure and greater expression and the wonderful, wondrous blessing of the Divine Love. 

Each of you will know this in your own way and will experience this in your own time, and will come to this recognition with clarity and joy. God gives you this gift, beloveds. God’s deepest desire is for you to be an awakened soul so that you may indeed have a deep and gratifying and beautiful relationship with Him. God created you so that you may be with Him in this glorious Love, that your souls may sparkle and shine in beauteous acknowledgement of God’s creation, to know the bliss, the joy, the wisdom, and the knowings that are meant for you. So much awaits you, beloveds. So much is meant to be given that will fill you up and overflow and touch others. In this wondrous life and being in God, you are truly His children, beloveds, and you are truly loved. 

God bless you. I am Jesus and yes, I am with you. In theI nurturance of your souls and these times of holy communion, in your yearning and stretching for the freedom of the awakened soul, I am with you. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you.
