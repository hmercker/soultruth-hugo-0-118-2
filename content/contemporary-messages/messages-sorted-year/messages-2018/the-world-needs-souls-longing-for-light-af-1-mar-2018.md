I am Mary, mother of Jesus.  May you feel within you the burning longing of your souls to be close to God, that you may come to God with the desires of your heart, the concerns of your life, the pains and difficulties of living a life in this world.  Lay them at God’s Feet and say: “My Beloved Heavenly Father, lift me up, bring me into the Light of Your Presence.  Infill my soul with your Love so that I might live in harmony and peace, joy and Truth, of the Truth that you wish to give me may be blessed within my soul and percolate up into my mind so that this Truth may be clear and powerful, that I might be awakened in Love”.

The world needs souls longing for Light.  The world has a deep need for souls who are strong in Light and clear in Truth and loving in their demeanour.  For the world is drowning in materialism and the minds of humanity are focused upon the basic conditions of this world and not upon their souls.

And yet, when a soul, an individual is in balance between the needs of their bodies and the needs of their souls, then there is joy and happiness, goodness and harmony.  You must exemplify this, beloved souls.  Be a child of God living in this world in harmony and peace and these gifts that come from God will be given to all who seek them.  God does not choose who receives.  He Loves all His children and will give to each and every soul that desires to be blessed with His Love and His blessings of healing and Light and Truth.

Know within yourselves beloveds that you are Loved and come to know the power of God’s Love in a conscious and real expression within your life and your being.  So much awaits every soul who desires to be with God.  God will push away the barriers, will Light the path and will bring you ever closer to His Light and Presence.  It is for you to desire this and to act upon the promptings of your souls to come to know your Heavenly Father.

I bless you with my love.  For I love you dearly beloved souls, and all who seek Light and all who seek Truth, and all who seek this Love, this great blessing from God.  God bless you and may He keep your soul in His Love and Light.  I am Mary and I am with you and I love you. God bless you.
