# Integrate Soul Awakenings with Mind and Body 

October 24<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada


Received by Maureen Cardoso

 

I would like to come and speak to you, to inspire you to take away with you from this time of being together somewhat of a study of all the teachings that you have received in this past time of gathering together. Make this a study of your soul, the science of your soul and that which is connected and carries the soul, the body and the mind. There have been great awakenings that have been happening within each one of you. In your prayers together and while you’ve been praying on your own, each of you has felt these various awakenings. It would be good for you to carry on in connecting and identifying these various parts that have strengthened and are deeper in your conscious awareness. For as you continue to strengthen in your walk and in your journey - your own development - this is important. But also as you share and teach this to the many souls that will come before you with great curiosity and a desire to have their souls too awakened by this love, you will find many of these people will look to you for guidance, reassurance and comfort. 

Beloveds, you have been nurtured in deep ways in your soul awakening. There is much that you have learned and discovered in this period of being together that if you are to look back and study these teachings that have been brought forth and the guidance that has been given to you, you will see there is much to carry and to deliver, to share and to support others with. So I would encourage you, beloveds, as you learn to become more aware of your own soul, you truly study this science and bringing this like a second nature, into your awareness for this is your soul awakening. But beloveds you do walk with a physical body and are gifted a physical mind that also is in service to your soul. So as you strengthen and deepen in that connection to yourself, share and teach each others the unity that they are. 

It is important of course, to understand the soul. But beloveds as you begin to walk as a whole being, they will find that your strength and your ability to share with others this fullness of who they are, rather than just separating out the soul, this will take time, this will take strength. It is not something you have to worry about in your discovery of this, but simply allow your connection to grow and observe it, taking note in your own personal development. For you will be able to share with others the true value of this beautiful vessel God has gifted you with, your body and your mind to serve your soul, to allow your soul’s purpose to be expressed in this world. For without this physical body, it is not possible for your soul to express its purpose.

The physical human being is a precious, precious gift from God. So bringing this unification of these three aspects of you, body, mind and soul into a greater understanding, you will walk that much stronger in this world. It is not to discard the mind and the physical body. It is to bring it all into alignment, allowing this love that infills your soul to have an expression with grace, with humility, with integrity, and respect. 

So I invite you to take up this study as you complete your time here together, an exercise of recognizing the harmony that these three aspects can live in. God bless you. My love is with you. I am Keea-atta Kem and I love you.
