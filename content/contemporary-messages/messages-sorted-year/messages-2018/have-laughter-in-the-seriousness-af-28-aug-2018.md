# Have Laughter in the Seriousness of Learning Spiritual Things

August 28<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Gibsons, B.C. Canada - Mediumship Retreat

Received by Al Fike

 

Sometimes my teacher friends are too serious I think and they forget that joy makes all learning fun. We indeed need to be joyful together in love acknowledging how wonderful life is, how wonderful you all are in your unique expressions and beauties. 

I come to tickle you all in love and I come to inspire you to laugh. So when you feel a sense of joy, don’t hold back, but laugh. Be joyful. Love. Be with one another in the acknowledgement of how wonderful life is, how beautiful you all are. Create the joy and know that joy brings you close to God. 

I love you and I am with you. I am with you often to help up-lift, to inspire you with laughter, to bring love. God bless you. I love you. I am Goldie and I love you.
