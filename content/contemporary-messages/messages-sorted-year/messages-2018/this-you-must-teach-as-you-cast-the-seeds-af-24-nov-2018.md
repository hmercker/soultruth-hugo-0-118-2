# This You Must Teach as You Cast the Seeds

What a great light you are building in this home with your prayers and your conversations, keeping your minds upon the higher truths and nurturing one another in this effort to bring light into your midst. Indeed it is having its effects. You are feeling and experiencing the upliftment of your souls in this beautiful condition of light. 

This is what humanity needs my friends, not the distractions, not the intense mental machinations, not the bickering about truth and arguments about reality. None of these things bring the soul to a place of receptivity so that it may awaken in the fullness of the Father’s Love. **No, it is that quiet surety, that beautiful peace, that loving demeanor that brings the angels in your midst and God’s blessing upon you.** 

This you must teach as you cast the seeds about you. Yes these seeds may fall on fallow ground and fall on fertile ground. It is not for you to judge or to be concerned, merely to go about your work as channels of God’s Love and Truth in the world. As you do so with humility and grace, with focus and purpose, many will be touched. Those seeds will be deposited within the consciousness of those to whom you speak. In this way, you will have done your work. Yes in your world there is always a desire for immediate results and this, in the flow of God’s Universe, is not always possible nor likely. It requires patience. 

As you continue to pray for all those who have been touched and connected to you, asking God to continue to bless your brothers and sisters, asking God to widen the scope of His efforts in your world so that in time there will be a tipping point where these truths and all the Truths of God, the Truths of Love, the Truths of Light, will take hold and create a shift in the consciousness of mankind. 

It is a great and noble work that you do, my brothers. All who engage within it must be steadfast, consistent, faithful and make all the effort that they can muster so that you may indeed bring this truth to the ears of those who are curious, who wish to listen and those whose souls will reverberate with the words and love that you bring so that God may bless you all in His Love. Continue to be God’s purveyors of truth. Continue to be of good faith. Continue to ask God to guide you, to inspire you with words, to enwrap you in His Love, that as you walk and speak, as you heal, inspire, and pray, this Light may indeed manifest and flow to many. 

As you become the conduit, a purveyor for God’s Love and Truth to flow, God needs your effort. He needs your sincere and wholehearted desire to serve. As His Light and Love continues to flow and be transmitted through the many angels and spirits and mortals to this world, though you see your work as humble in comparison with the need of humanity, you are enacting the Will of God and you will bring many souls to the Truth as you continue to be persistent and put forth the efforts that are required. 

You do not know the future. You cannot see where you are going, not in any great detail, but I tell you, you are on a beautiful and mighty path that will take you to many souls and will afford the sowing of many seeds of truth and light. Every time you step forward as you are willing to do on the morrow, you step a little closer to your purpose and to this great task of teaching the truth of God’s Love to humanity. In your efforts, much flows to you, to your soul, strengthening and widening the condition of love within you. This will bring greater power and beauty to your efforts and in this ever-increasing flow of this work, you will see the doors open of which you ask and speak of. It must come in response to the power of God’s Love within you. It is a matter of faith. It is a matter of effort, of prayer, of consistency, and of joy. 

May these gifts and blessings continue to pour upon you my beloved brothers, and we will continue to accompany you upon your journeys and bring you face-to-face with many whose souls seek the truth. May you have the power as God’s channels to penetrate the resistance of the mind and touch the soul with the great sword of Truth, laying it bare to receive the healing of God, His Touch of Love.

God bless you. I will be with you on the morrow (a talk and prayer in Fitzroy Falls NSW) as will many. Each soul will have an angel with them and you will all be inspired in your work and talk and efforts and prayers. God bless you. I am Faith. My love is with you, beloved, beloved brothers, with you all. God bless you.
