You could not leave without me saying goodbye, your friend Goldie, to wish you a wonderful journey and a wonderful day together. I have been with you too. I am like a little sprite that follows the great light of the Master and I come to bring great joy and my love to you. So I have been with you each and every day, to bring my blessings and love to you. I am one of many, many angels that have come to minister to you in these times together. Beloved beloveds, all the resources of Heaven have been poured upon you like a great rainbow of light and love, soothing all parts of you, enlightening and enlivening all parts of you. So much has been given from your simple acknowledgement, prayers and love. So much will continue to be given in God’s great bounty of blessings. And I will continue to be by your side, to help lighten your day, to help bring joy and a sparkle to your eyes. Goldie loves you. God bless you my beautiful friends. God bless you.
