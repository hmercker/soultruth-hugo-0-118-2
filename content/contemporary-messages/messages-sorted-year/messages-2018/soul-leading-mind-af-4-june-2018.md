# Soul Leading Mind

A question has been asked and I am happy to respond, with the intention of bringing
clarity. The world is a very complicated and layered place, filled with many thoughts,
feelings, ideas, intentions, desires, emotions of all sorts. When you come to soul
awakening, there is a greater sensitivity and awareness of these conditions in the world
and how they press upon you, when you are vulnerable and confused. When you feel
many emotions swirling about within you, and you ask, “where do these feelings come
from, where does this confusion come from?” In many regards it is the mind’s
interpretation of the soul’s longings that causes confusion. This misinterpretation of the
longing soul that seeks to be with God, affects the mind in many ways. The mind
interprets, transforms the feelings of the soul, the thoughts of the soul, and formulates it
into ideas and feelings that conform with the condition of the material mind. Thus the
material mind tries to make sense of the world and of your inner world, in ways that are
not necessarily in harmony or truthful to the conditions of the soul, the understandings
of the soul. Thus conflict arises, discomfort, confusion, because as you transition from
the ways of the mind, the material mind, and the ways of the soul, this in-between place
is a place where these two conditions collide and cause a measure of chaos.


You have not teased out the Truth that comes with the knowings of the soul from the
error which is the result of the workings of the mind and its patterns long established in
your life. This discomfort will continue as long as you entertain these conditions and
allow the mindful perceptions to invade the Truth that comes within the soul. It is
understandable that you will feel confusion and that you will feel the discomfort with this
transition, this change within you of perception, of motivation, feelings and thoughts that
continue to originate from the soul. Yet, as you try to integrate these things from the
soul, you find it difficult to put it together in a way that is sensible and understandable.
This is an object lesson in the differences between the soul and the mind.


The language of the soul is quite different than the language of the mind. Its way of
knowing and being in the world does not conform in any significant way to what you
have been taught and what you have absorbed in your lives by functioning from the
awareness of your material minds. Indeed, there are two minds within you, one of the
soul and one of the material mind. To integrate these two parts of yourself, these nodes
of consciousness, one that is growing ever stronger and one that is weakening because
it holds less sway upon your modes of thought and action in this transition time, there is
conflict, there is the need for adjustment. To truly understand what is happening within
you and then to apply these changes and differences to how you respond to the outside
world is again another challenge.


So you go back and forth. You pray to be with God, you feel His Love pouring into you,
the influence of Love and Light changing you, and then you must venture out into in the
outside world. Almost immediately you sense the difference. You find it difficult to
reconcile these two areas of consciousness with one another because for so long you
have used the ideas and knowledge of the mind to motivate you in life. Yet God has
asked you to walk a different path, to be in a different mode of awareness, to be
motivated differently, motivated out of Love, and not just the natural love but the Divine
Love.


When we ask you to be God’s Channels of Love, His Instruments, to be a shining
example of the Truth, this cannot be fully realized without such transition and change
within you. This change is taking place and you are feeling its effects. Yes, at times this
is very uncomfortable, confusing, even aggravating as you try to match up these two
realities in a way that brings a semblance of harmony within you. These are your tests
my beloved children, to walk in the world but not be of the world, to be a channel of
Love rather than joining humanity in this great venture that humanity has created, this
reality. It is difficult and requires strength, clarity, faith, Love.


You must focus upon your souls, my beloveds. Indeed, there are times when you wish
to withdraw in silence and prayer. Even the Master Jesus withdrew often to be with
God, to seek guidance and strength in His Love. So your souls feel compelled to be with
God, to take that time to be quiet, to be in prayer and communion with God. Yet life
continues to beckon you forward, draw you away from that place of deep comfort and
peace. It will ever be thus, for the world is in great need. The world feels the comfort
that you give, and that you are a Light. Many are drawn to this. Can you refuse those
who are drawn? Can you refuse those that God has placed before you? The soul never
will refuse Love if the soul is infused with God’s Love. So when you feel ambivalent
about the opportunities that God places before you, to be a channel of His Love, to
bring peace and comfort to others, ask yourself, what part of me feels this way? What
part of me is in a state of conflict? In most cases, it is your mind.


Indeed, it is difficult to dampen down the conditions of the mind and accentuate the
Light of the soul, and yet this is your challenge at this time. This is the challenge and the
opportunity for growth that God has given you, to walk in the world but not of the world.
Think of this, beloved souls, for you have come to a place where God is asking you to
be in the world, but not of the world. So you are continually challenged by this invitation,
and yet God does not ask you to be so because He wishes for you to be in conflict. No
my beloveds, He asks you because you are ready to be in that place of soul awareness,
the dominance of the soul. The question is, are you willing to take that leap of faith, to
follow this guidance given, this invitation proffered to you because you are ready to step
forward in this way? It is not as difficult as you might think. Yes, there are things to be
released, attitudes and ideas that are outmoded and not necessary. Instead you must
take on this new way of being and thinking and doing. Each day offers you the
opportunity to choose. Yes, it is wise to retreat to God, to be with God, to pray and ask
for His Love and strength, to be tutored by God in the ways of Love and Light. This
comes as your souls open, your sensitivities increase, your awareness of God’s
Presence becomes strong, and a vital part of your reality.


You walk upon this path and sometimes you look backwards, wondering about the road
you have walked, sometimes regressing to old ways and thoughts, but often you move
forward. You continue to grow and to take on the challenge of change. God will uplift
you and uphold you in His Love. The angels will be by your side, always. We continue
to support you in your efforts to change, to be in greater harmony with God, to make
Love the motivation of your life, to bring Truth into your life, enacted and proliferated in
everything that you do. This is not easy, but it is rewarding indeed. God needs those
strong souls who are willing to be a shining example of Truth and Love in the world, to
teach this, to exemplify it, to be this in every way possible. This is your life, my
beloveds, those of you who have chosen this life, so that you may teach and heal and
be a comfort to many, but first you must bring all of these things to yourself.


To be in that place of great strength and Light, harmony and Love does not happen
overnight. Many of you have been praying for many years and you do indeed recognize
the changes that you have made, the growth that has come to your soul. This
continues, it becomes more acute and your awareness deeper. You see the challenges
that are ahead of you, the obstacles that still must be cleared so that you may be in that
place of great strength and Truth. God will continue to bless you, my beloveds. You are
not alone in this. You will never be alone in this. You are greatly upheld by the Hand of
God. Be strong, my beloveds. Be clear in your intentions. Recognize the longings of
your souls and enact this in prayer. Be of great faith and be at peace, my beloved souls.
You are carried, you are growing, you are shedding the old ways of being.


You are in the midst of a great change within you, preparing you for the great change
that is coming to the world. This you must keep forefront in your minds that all of these
conditions and conflicts within you need to be recognized and released in preparation
for your instrumentality in the world. Your soul leaps in joy with the understanding of
this. Your mind is riddled with a lack of surety, yet you persist. The soul is stronger. The
soul knows and needs to forge ahead, to realize its purpose in life, this life, and to serve
God in Love. May you do so, my beloveds. May you do so with great courage and faith
and strength. My Love and prayers are with you. I love you dearly. I am your teacher,
Augustine. May God bless you, beloveds. May God bless you. Thank You
