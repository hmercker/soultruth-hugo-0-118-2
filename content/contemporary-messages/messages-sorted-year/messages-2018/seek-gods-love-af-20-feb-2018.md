# Seek God’s Love to Awaken Your Souls

Seek to know your souls, for within your soul lies the keys to all the answers that you seek. Only understandings that are spiritual in nature come from the awakening of the soul. So many seek with their minds and they construct understandings and realities that they believe are true and plausible. Yet in many ways the mind cannot comprehend the ways of God. The mind can observe, can deduce certain things, but to truly know you must understand with the faculties of your souls. So I urge you, my beloveds, I urge you to seek to know that place within yourselves that is of God. For your souls are the image of God, my beloveds, and in the pursuit of the Divine Love comes the substance of God flowing into your souls, His Love, His Light flooding your souls and awakening those parts of you that are long dormant.

With your sincere prayers, your longings, the expressions of your heart will come many blessings, many beautiful blessings that will awaken the passions of the soul and bring you close to your Creator. It is a journey, beloved souls, a journey of awakening, of opening the eyes, of knowing, of seeing, of being in the flow of God's Love. In this comes other gifts, blessings unimagined, opportunities and experiences gifted to you by God. So I urge you, my beloveds, to patiently seek the awareness of your souls, to feel the Love of God, that those gifts that are hidden within your souls will  lead you to many Truths and awarenesses that the mind cannot bring you to, my beloveds.

There is so much to know. There is so much to be given. And you spend little time in this world. Soon you will be in the world of spirit, for an earthly life is short and yet within this life you may learn a great deal and experience many things, but you must do so by the laws of God's Creation. He urges you to seek Him from the depths of your soul, to ask for His blessings of Love, to allow this gift to enter and to flourish within you. It does not require a certain prayer but you may ask from your hearts, that a deep longing asks and urges God to come close. When your souls open to that flow of Love, capture this Light within, allow it to pour in every corner and chamber of your soul for in this comes a deep healing, a deep sense of peace and a beautiful awakening. It is gentle. It is of God. Each day this may come, each day an opportunity to grow, each day a little closer to God. So say your prayers, my beloved souls. Feel the urgings and the desires within. All will be given, all will flow to you. With this rapport,  a heartfelt desire, a seeking that will give deep understanding and great joy and knowing.

May the Peace that passes all understanding be with you, my beloveds, for God is present with you. Drink deep His living waters, drink deep and know that He is with you. God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine and my love is with you. God bless you.
