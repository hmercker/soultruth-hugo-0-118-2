I come, I am Jesus. Take respite in this Love, the Light that God pours upon you my beloveds. Take respite in this great peace of the presence of the Creator.

Each of you is a Light. Each of you carries a Light. May your Light shine in this world beloveds. May your love flow in dark places and bring comfort to many. For God needs those who are willing to walk this world as a channel of His Love, to lay down all conditions within themselves that are not of Love and to allow the purity of the Father’s Love to flow into every part of them, enlivening their spirits and souls. In this way they may walk this world as an example, as an instrument of God.

For what this world needs more than anything is Love and what the soul needs and longs for is Love and yet so many do not know this unlimited supply of Love that comes from the Father’s Soul to your soul. Merely a longing and a prayer, a desire expressed, brings this gift within you. The gift that shall never leave you. A gift that shall multiply within you. A gift for all eternity, my beloveds.

It is and shall always be my message that God’s Love is the redeeming grace of the soul. It is what will heal your burdens, uplift and bring forth the great potentials of the soul. For each child carries many gifts and there are many possibilities to bring forth these gifts in Love. To see the world from the eyes of Love. To touch all of those around you, my beloveds, with the embrace of Love. To care for your brothers and sisters. To bring this Truth in simple ways in your lives, in all that you do.

My beloveds. Walk with me upon this path. Serve God in every and in all ways possible. Come to know the Will of God as He speaks to you within your souls and be at peace my beloveds and know that God has claimed you and shall carry you forth into at-onement. 

It is Love that is the key and has always been the key to great fulfillment, joy and peace. May it be what you seek always, beloved souls, and as you do so I will be with you. The angels will be with you, as you continue to seek the empowerment of your souls through the blessings of the Father’s Love that come with the Holy Spirit. 

This simple way is what will change the world. The simple way is what will change you my beloveds and you will come to know the world through different eyes and come to hear the Will of God that may be expressed through you, my beloveds. 

May you find the path prescribed for you. The path that is meant for you. The path that will bring you to the fulfillment of your purpose in this world. It is clearly laid before you my beloveds. Open your eyes to see. May the scales be peeled away and your understanding clear as your souls awaken and your minds come to accept the power of Love. God bless you my beloveds. I am Jesus and I love you. I embrace you. I am with you. God bless you.
