# Remember God Whatever the Day Brings

November 27<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Sydney, Australia

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am pleased that my friend will allow me to speak. It is important to not be in a rush. In this group of five runs the gamut from scheduling your day to spontaneity and of course, everything in between. But the question is, will you remember God, whatever the day brings? It is not a matter of scheduling/not scheduling, but being in the flow, as you say. This flow is remembering God whatever the task, whatever the journey, whatever the place you find yourself, bringing your love to each soul, being in that flow which recognises the sanctity of each soul.

This does not mean you must stop and greet every single person on the street or in the store or wherever you may be, but there are those who are directed towards you and as you know, they show up at just the right time. This is your opportunity to be a blessing to them. Each of you has the Light of Love, of God’s Love, in your soul. As the Master said and as the song goes,  do not hide the lamp, but let it shine.

My dear friends, your love will change this world. You can touch every soul reaching out. I encourage you to make these events available to the many and to utilise the talents of those in your community, because everyone has gifts. Everyone contributes to the work of spreading the Truth of the Father’s Love and of course go deeper, which is to be a Light.

There is much Light in this place because all of you have kept it sacred. We are very pleased with this and you should know that God Himself has ordained this sacred spot. So do not rush. Be in the flow. Take time for each one that appears before you. Remember God. Share the love in your soul as you do with each other, with much humour, share this with all.

Thank you for allowing me to share this with you. May God continue to bless you, each one. May His Love fill your souls and guide you each day. My love to each one, I am your brother and friend, Yogananda.
