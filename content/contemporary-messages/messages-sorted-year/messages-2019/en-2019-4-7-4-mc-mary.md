Mary received by Maureen Cardoso

It is Mary. Yes, as the dear soul indicates, there is no competition in Divine Love, but as you say in your world, ladies first. So I am here. All my beloved, beloved children, what a joy it is to see you gather in such a way, bringing light, streams of light across your Earth, helping mankind come to the awakening of their souls.

My beloved children, when you pray for the gift of Divine Love, the Grace of the Father’s Love coming into your soul creates a transformation, transforming your soul, allowing your true self to come forward. My dear ones, as you do this, your gifts open. As your gifts open, our Father desires to use those gifts for the awakening of mankind and us in the Celestial Spheres desire to use your gifts as well, to speak messages, to bring healing, to bring comfort, joy, and peace into your world.

So as you progress in your soul and you find a gift opening, as your dear brother has and you will now witness, another gift come forward. It is natural to have some inhibition, some doubts, to resist slightly. But my dear friends, know that when your gift opens, there has been years of preparation. God has nurtured this gift in your soul by His Love. We the Celestial Angels have helped in the preparation much longer than when this gift opens. So, my dear friends, as you walk along this path and you too experience the gifts in your soul opening, rest assured that God’s Hand is upon you, the Celestial Angels surround you, and we desire to use your gifts for the highest possible outcome.

So I wish to just come and say, my dear and beloved son, embrace your gift, allow the angels to bring forward messages to your brothers and sisters. Embrace who you are in the Truth of God’s Love. Embrace your true self, your soul, and rest your mind. Rest your mind, dear son, and all will be well. You are a blessed soul desiring to serve in the highest way, but you must step forward and take the step and show yourself that this gift is true, is pure, and has been opened by God. I am with you, my son, my love is with each of you. I am Mary. God bless you this day. I am with you.
