God bless you, beloved souls, my name is Keea-Atta Kem. I join you from the Celestial Heavens. There are other Celestial Angels who are gathered here with you as well as you come together in this Circle of Light welcoming the presence of Love from your Beloved Creator to touch your soul, to nourish your soul, to transform your soul into the purity of Divine Love. This is a Love, this gift of Love, which is the highest gift available to all. It is an Essence given freely from your Creator to your soul, one that only requires you to long and to yearn for and to desire to receive. 

When you do reach to your Beloved Creator in such a way, with a clear intention, there is always a response given. This Essence will flow into your soul and bring great peace, and a sense of well-being. It will cleanse that which is of a condition that is out of harmony, out of harmony with the Laws of Creation, out of harmony with all that is good. As this Love works upon your soul and begins to transform the very essence of who you are, you are changed forever. 

It is a process that comes in drop by drop, shall we say. As one puts forth a great effort, so then this response is great. There are many distractions for you who live upon Earth, many demands upon your life. So it can be that your dedication to that spiritual part of you is set aside or perhaps even ignored. For these many distractions on the material plane grab at you and require your attention.

My encouragement, beloveds, is to nurture and nourish that spiritual part of who you are, the truth of who you are. For all souls leave the Earth plane and when you leave, the condition of your soul and the condition of your mind is what goes with you. There are many practices to train the mind to be disciplined in good thought in a meditative way. It this is very important also for your mind to be aligned and connected to your Beloved Creator.

Yet, at this time, what you sit for, this Essence of Love, this gift from God, is for your soul. It is an elixir that will bring all into harmony. As you experiment and experience that which can be given by this Love, you will come to understand what we know in a great, great way. My love and encouragement is with you.

We will to acknowledge the dear soul who has opened his home, to offer his space, to draw forward those in the community, to give a place of sanctuary and refuge from that which distracts you, and to offer a coming together, a coming together of souls with a singleness of purpose of nourishing their true selves and the awakening their souls.

You are mightily blessed, dear son, for the openness that you share with many. So as you will sit in silence now, there is a Celestial Angel with each one of you who is there to bring their love and their light to you. So I will close now and as I do, I leave my love and I bring my light to shine down upon all of you, helping to assist each one of you as well.

I am Keea-Atta Kem and my love is with you. God bless you.
