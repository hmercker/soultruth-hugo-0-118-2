I bring you my blessings, beloved souls, my brothers and sisters whom I embrace in love, who are truly beloved by God. I come to acknowledge each of you, beloved souls. I see your lights. I know your souls and I wish to tell you that as you continue to grow in the Fatherâ€™s Love, I will be by your side. I will insure that you find your way to God. As your elder brother, I will lead you to the Holy Communion and at-onement with your Creator, our Heavenly Father. I am with you, beloveds. I am with you. God bless you. May His Blessings continue to pour into your souls awakening, awakening all that is within you. I am with you and I shall always be with you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
