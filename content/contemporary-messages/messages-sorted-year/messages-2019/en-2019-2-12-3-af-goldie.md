# We Will Be with You in Your Travels

February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2019

General Collection, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

And I will be with you dear daughter who travels. I will be with you, walking with you as will many of us who will be making deep rapport with those who are seeking in their souls. There will be many opportunities to speak the truth, to be a channel of love, to walk in the light as strangers and friends alike. We will be with you in joyful anticipation of the blessings that God will bring to you all.

I am with you. I am always with you, my friends to lighten the load, to bring joy where I can, to help and love and encourage because I love you. I am your friend. Goldie loves you. God bless you.
