FUSC Strategic Planning Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Alec Gaunt received by Maureen Cardoso

It is Alec. I wish you to know that I have been with you while you have been gathered over these past couple of days in prayer seeking guidance, coming together to support one another, for the many changes that are upon this beautiful place, this sanctuary where you all work and gather.

Offer loving support to the community, for this is what this beautiful place requires at this time. Is People who are banned together, unified in a vision, willing to work through the nature of love for one another, for the community, for the growth that will happen, open to support those who have ideas. Those who wish to share their gifts. For there comes a great strength in community. When love is the power from which you work and share and exchange, there is great harmony.

So, my dear friends allow this bond to strengthen. Allow the others who will join you to feel close to you also. Allow a great experience of family to be shared and to be felt. For as the many lost souls are guided to this place, they will need your strength. They will need your comfort, your wisdom, your experience, your knowledge, your compassion, your embrace, your love. You will see, beloveds, that great harmony will exist amongst all. So, you are encouraged to continue to strengthen your relationship with God. For when one acts from their highest being, acting from your soul, all fears melt away, worries melt away. For you know Godâ€™s Hand is upon your life and guiding you.

Surely as you live in this material world, this earth plane, there are worries, there are concerns, there are challenges and struggles. This is part of the earth existence. But you, my beloveds, you know how to overcome these worries and struggles leaning into God, the support of one another, and the support from us, your angel friends. So, what 

you will find over time as you strengthen in your soul with this love developing your relationship with God your worries and fears, struggles and anxieties are washed away. You then again are centered in your soul, in the true being of who you are, releasing challenges from the mind and these anxieties from the mind.

You are on the cusp of great, great change. This you are all well aware of. Your friends who are invested in the changes and the development and the growth of this beautiful place work closely with you. I am but one of your friends who support you. Continue to be close to God. Gather in these prayers and may I suggest that before these meetings, prayer may become something that helps to truly establish the environment before the meeting occurs. Bring the Love of God into these meetings and watch, beloveds, watch the power of love unfold and guide and direct the future of this beautiful place.

Many angels watch over and work closely with you. We thank you for your dedication and we are here to help and assist. For we too serve God, just as you do. May God bless each of your efforts and your continued bond with one another. Be at peace, beloveds. I am Alec, and my love is with you. God bless you.
