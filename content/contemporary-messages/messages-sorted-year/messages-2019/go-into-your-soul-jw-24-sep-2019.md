# Go Into Your Soul

September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Punalu’u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


The mind has such a dominance over humankind, so much to process, thoughts, all kinds of information, often conflicting one with the other. That this why, my dear friends, I encourage you to go into your soul where there is always truth and where truth prevails.

It is true, a calm mind and meditation, withdrawing from the world, is a very good thing. Certainly the world needs more of that. But you my friends, who know of this great Love that lifts you up and above this world, that awakens your souls and your soul perceptions, this yoga of Divine Love, I will always encourage, because it leads to the very transformation of each soul who receives it. If you wish to be changed, this is the path that is required. It is never demanded, only offered. Seek the kingdom first and all things will be given. Did not the Master say this?

May your day be blessed. We shall watch over you. There are healing angels and spirits with the dear brother in hospital, per your request. Many are praying. Blessings will be received. Have no doubt. May the Creator’s Love flow in you, reside in your souls, and transform them. 

I am your brother and friend, from the Celestial heavens. I am Yogananda. God bless you. My love to all.
