I am here, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. You know me as a writer. The books that I wrote, the stories that I wrote, are still read widely to this day and often exaggerated (in film) to fit the musings of this time. Oddly enough, my works were quite rational. They debunked, to certain extent, what was deemed as mysterious. Yet, at the same time, I was a great believer in the spirit world and the angels. I devoted a great deal of time to studying the spirit world.

This may seem a bit of a dichotomy to those who only know one side of me, but because the theme today, as my gracious brothers, beautiful Celestial brothers, have spoken about, is the mind and the soul, I wish to say that my mind was pre-occupied with telling a story in a unique and engrossing way and I was quite successful at this. At the same time, my soul longings were deep and I did promote spiritualism and those who I believed were true mediums. 

I felt the Grace of God, though not at all like I have now in spirit. I encourage each one of you to pray often, to leave your doubts behind and allow this beautiful Love of God to enter your souls. This is the best advice I could give. I am so pleased that this one has allowed me to come through. I shall come again and I thank you for allowing me this moment with you, in this beautiful Light you have, which drew me to your circle.

God bless you, I am Arthur Conan Doyle.
