# Know You Are Blessed by God

October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come, I am Jesus. I come to tell you that God has blessed each one of you here, that He has put His Love within your soul. Each of you carries a light that signifies that you are claimed by God in this Love. Carry this sure knowledge within you, beloved souls. Take comfort in this truth that you are touched by God deeply within your soul, and that you will continue to grow and come to that place of at-onement with God, that you are indeed blessed, beloved children. You are indeed a part of my family, and that I shall lead you forth upon the plains of your world and the plains in spirit. I shall lead you forth and show you the way to at-onement, and to habitation within the Celestial Kingdom.

Each of you are blessed. Know the warmth of that blessing within your heart. Know that you continue upon that journey that will bring at-onement and deep joy.

God bless you beloveds. I am with you. I am with each one of you beloved souls. And I care deeply for each one, for each is my brother and my sister. I walk with you. I walk with you. God bless you. God bless you deeply on your path. God bless you.
