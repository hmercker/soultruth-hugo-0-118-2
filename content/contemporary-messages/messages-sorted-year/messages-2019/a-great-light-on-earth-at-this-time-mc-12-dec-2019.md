# A Great Light on the Earth at this Time of the Year

Received by Maureen Cardoso



I am Mary, the mother of your elder brother Jesus. Dear friends, at this time of the year on earth there is a greater light that emanates from your planet for there is something very special about this time of year that for most it brings a spirit of light to them. There is celebration, there is an extending of love from the heart for one another, strangers offering kindness to others which is the very essence that this time of year generates. I wish to bring clarity and understanding to the truth of the gift that Jesus brought to earth.

There was a time when the first man and the first woman were given the opportunity to receive the Essence of God's Love, what we call Divine Love, into their souls. As it was, this gift was refused by these two individual souls, these two humans, for at that point in time they felt an abundance of the natural love that they were born with and there was a sense that there was no need for the Divine Love. So because at that time as this Love was not accepted, so it was not given. Now it was when Jesus came to earth, the most incredible gift that he brought forward upon his birth was the return and the availability for all souls to receive this Divine Love, all souls of earth and all souls in spirit.

This beloved son of mine was born free of sin with a pure heart. As he lived his life he was very drawn to spiritual things and God from an early age. As he continued in his path to come closer to God he communed from his soul to God's Soul and he understood the gift of Divine Love. As Jesus' true mission was awakened in him to teach mankind of the glory of this gift, it was often that he was misunderstood. There were very few who understood what he was teaching and who came to open their souls to the receiving of this gift of Divine Love.

Now, dear beloveds, as this gift still remains open to all souls through time, some have been awakened such as the apostles at Pentecost by the gift of Divine Love inflowing into their souls and transforming them. And they too set out to teach what it was that Jesus tried to teach. Many refused and you know his story, how his life was ended. But even though his physical life came to a quick end, he continued in spirit to teach of the importance of awakening the soul and freeing the soul from the dark conditions by receiving the gift of Divine Love. 

This gift remains to this day and it is what you, beloved souls, are experiencing at this moment, this energy of Love, this Essence. This Love will transform you, awakening your essence, the truth of who you are and bringing forward your gifts that God has implanted within each one of you. These gifts when they are awakened by the grace of Divine Love, they bring great harmony to mankind, great light upon your earth. At this time that you are living each one, each one here, each soul has a desire to help mankind to awaken to light and to love and to harmony. So by receiving this Love within your soul, you are serving your brothers and sisters for as you call forth this Love, the energy of this Love from within your soul ripples out to all those who are in your presence. It plants seeds of curiosity within other souls, creating a lattice of light one soul to the other, awakening breath by breath, receiving the Love of God. 

It is our great hope and mission that every soul may be connected in this lattice of light that is here upon your earth or at least a great number of souls connected so that those souls who are in a darkened condition can be uplifted to some degree and feel a great blessing by being in your presence. Beloved souls, allow God to awaken you, allow the Divine Love to awaken your souls, awaken to the purpose that you have agreed to upon your incarnation and allow this Love to be who you are in all its glory.

I thank you for hearing my words this evening and for hearing the call of your soul to come and sit in circle and be with one another in this precious building that is blessed by God. Fill your souls, beloveds, with the Essence of God. I am Mary and my love is with you. God bless you.
