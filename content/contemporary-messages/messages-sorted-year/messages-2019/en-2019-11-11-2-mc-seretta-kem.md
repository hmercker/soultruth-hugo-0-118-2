# Portal of Light at Fitzroy Falls

November 11<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Fitzroy Falls, NSW, Australia

Seretta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

I am Seretta Kem and I come to share the joy in this celebration through the past of couple of days that you have shared the teachings of God's Divine Love with many, few who were aware, many who received these teachings for the very first time. I worked much behind the scenes during these days assisting with the portal that is here in your home. I wish to let you know that much has been added to this portal, elements and structure changed so that we may assist you through this portal in the circles that you have in your home.

My dear sister, we know you are slightly resistant to be in service with your mediumship and we understand you concerns though we ask for you to take into consideration at the level of your soul there is a great desire to have this gift be used, activated and realized in service for the many who will come to these circles. We ask that you allow us to assist you with the teachings through your gift of mediumship that we may come in support of you and your beloved partner who work so closely together to serve God. When your soul gifts are in service to the souls of your brothers and sisters, you are honoring your true self. So with the resistance of your mind we ask that you take to God these concerns and have these concerns to be nurtured and taken care of by the grace of God and for you beloved sister, to align with the soul, the gift of your soul that desires to be this instrument to God in such a way. Of course, your free will is part of your decision through your free will. But we know your desire to serve God in the highest way. As was said by the beloved Celestial earlier, God will not burden you through this gift. God will bless you and many through this gift. You are needed, beloved soul, and I come on behalf of the Celestial realms, the Celestial teachers, to invite you to open to this invitation of service through your grace and through your love, honoring the gifts of your soul. We will love you and support you as always. As you progress upon your path and find yourself standing to teach before many, we will be with you and we will teach through you. So this gift can be in service in many ways, dear one. But we await your decision with great compassion, love and understanding of the concerns you have with the gift.

God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. Many, many are with you as you well know. God bless you, my sister, and I love you.
