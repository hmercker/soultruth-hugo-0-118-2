# We Are Pleased with Your Efforts

July 14<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Q&A Retreat Gibsons, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

So you have continued to expand in your service to God and the ways in which you serve God. As you come to know your souls, so your souls reach out through the veil of your flesh into this world as a living channel of love for all whom you are with and pray for and become involved with their lives, beloved souls. Your gifts will continue to expand, the use of them, the ways in which they may be used will continue to grow.

There is much coming, my beautiful friends, much coming for you to do, much time when you will gather together and do God's work in many places in your world as God infuses His blessings and energies in this world, waking up those who are asleep, helping so many come to that place of soul awakening, at least know the possibilities that the soul may take and be in your world and the world of my world.

We are all very pleased with your efforts in this last week. You have made great strides and progress. You will continue to walk forward and seek to serve God in His Love and Truth, channels of love for humanity. May God bless you, beloved souls, on that journey. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. God bless you.
