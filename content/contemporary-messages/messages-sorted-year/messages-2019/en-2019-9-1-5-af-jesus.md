# All Who Desire to Work for God Will Find a Way of Expression

September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May your souls be blessed, beloved souls. I come. I am Jesus. Though my brother is eager for you to step forward in Light and come to heal the world of its troubles and error, I say to you, any soul who desires to work for Truth and Light will find some way of expression, some opportunity to serve God for the Laws will be fulfilled by the desires of your souls expressed in this world. Know that any and all who are willing to step forward, no matter how humble the task, no matter that they do so without a clear understanding of what they do, they will be blessed. God will utilise your gifts and your Light for the benefit of others. There is always a way, beloved souls. There is always a way to serve God.

Allow the flow and beauty and wonderment of Godâ€™s Love to be enacted through each one of you in the world. You will find as you walk in faith that you will be guided in faith and Truth and Love and that we in the Celestial Kingdom will walk with you. Indeed, the way will be open, the path will be made clear, the possibilities to bring the Truth to humanity will be realised for this is the Will of God. God bless you beloved souls. I am your brother and I walk with you. God bless you. God bless you.
