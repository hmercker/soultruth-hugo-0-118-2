# Jesus Incarnated as a Complete Soul and Has No Other Half or Soulmate

God bless you, it is Master Jesus, your friend and brother who resides in the highest of the Celestial Kingdom.  There has been a question posed by our dear brother from far off regarding the existence of a soulmate in my life. 

Mary Magdelene was never my soulmate for when I came to Earth there was an agreement between me and my Heavenly Father that I would walk this path alone and would not require a companion such as this as do all other souls in God’s creation in your world and mine. This was a singular blessing given to me because of my particular work and role in bringing humanity to the Truth of God’s Love.
 
There are no other souls that have reached my place of habitation in the Celestial Heavens and there is no need on my part to have a companion in these places. And yes, in this way it makes me a unique creation of God and yet I do not feel a lacking or a deep desire for this onement of love between myself and my soulmate. This may surprise you, my beloveds, but this is not a sacrifice on my part. It is merely my truth, the truth of my existence and who I am. So I will never entertain the at-onement that is the partaking of soulmates in the great scheme of the soul’s transcendence to at-onement with God. Yet my love for all of humanity, for you my precious brothers and sisters, brings a great fulfillment to my soul, a sense that I am with you all, that I walk in the Truth of the Father’s Love. I am engaged in such a ministry and effort to bring the Truth to you all that I have little time to entertain these requirements of a relationship. 

I do walk alone and yet I walk with my Heavenly Father. I walk with my brothers and sisters. I walk in a world that is filled with great love and joy. I want for nothing, beloveds. I need for nothing other than the nourishment of God within me. I know great joy and fulfillment in this. Yes there have been many years of speculation and assumptions regarding relationships between myself and others. I say to you, my desire for such is not present within me and in this I walk a singular path for I have no need. I am one soul and was one soul when I incarnated, not half as is with all of you, but one with God, one in my own self. This afforded me many blessings and insights and understandings of the soul complete and pure in my incarnation. 

Yet, as you know, I continue to grow in the Father’s Love and awaken thus in my ministry and efforts in this world and in the next. Yes I continue to grow in Love as do you all. I continue to forge the path for you all. I continue to love you all. I am your brother, your friend, and I walk the path that God has chosen for me and I have chosen with God to attain in my existence. 

God bless you, my beloveds. I hope that this may answer this question of my soulful composition and need for a soulmate. God bless you and my love is with you, beloveds. I am with you in all that you do for the sake of Truth and Love. God bless you. God bless you.
