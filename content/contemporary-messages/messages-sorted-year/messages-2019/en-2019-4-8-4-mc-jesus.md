Jesus received by Maureen Cardoso

I come. I am Jesus. May the Breath of God wash over each of you. May your light be illuminated by the gift of this Love. May your souls be cleansed and washed pure. May you open, open deeply to the reception of this Love, allowing a purity to come, a purity of knowing your Heavenly Father in your single way of allowing God, God’s Love to exude from every pore of your being. Allow this Love to illuminate, illuminate your being. Allow this Love to heal and wash and cleanse.

My brothers and sisters, there is no greater gift than awakening the soul by the gift of God’s Love. There is no higher attainment than awakening your soul and knowing our Heavenly Father, allowing, allowing yourself to be carried by the Hand of God. Allow God to bless you, my children. Allow God to bring these blessings through you, these blessings of Love, of comfort, of joy, of peace.

Remember, upon your creation, this was your agreement with your beloved Creator. You agreed to the awakening of your soul through this Grace of Love. You agreed to walk in your world as a soul awakening in this Love and to share this great gift and knowledge of God’s Love. Awaken, beloved souls, awaken! Awaken to this grace that is yours. Awaken to the Heaven within you. Open to the experience of Heaven on Earth.

I am Jesus and I bless you, each one. I bring a blessing of love and healing to each one of you. May the Breath of God bring life, pure life to your souls. I am Jesus. God bless you.
