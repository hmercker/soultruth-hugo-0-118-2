I am Keea-atta Kem.  How delightful it is to see you together in this place, to reaffirm your love for one another, to be working together and to seek greater development and harmony of your gifts together. Yes it is good that you come to pray to help reinforce this Portal of Light in this place on your world. It is an important element in this great endeavor, to have this portal strong and functioning well in a place so remote from many others. It is like that center pillar that holds up so much in a structure. This portal is a kingpin in this network that continues to grow around the world. So we encourage you to continue in your prayers and thoughts and efforts to bring greater Light to this part of your world, to assist God in His efforts, for the blessings to flow and the Light to expand and the Truth to be seeded in many places. 

You do not see the work that we do, how involved and complex it can get as you pray together in this simple way, but it is having its effect in the world. As you come together in a particular place in the world, so you are utilized fully by we in spirit to seed the awareness, the possibilities, the channels and the awakenings. So do not underestimate what it is that you can accomplish together as you travel and bond together as one unified force, a clear channel for God to work in this world in ways that from your perspective are simple. But truly, the amount of activity and efforts, flows of energies, touches of Light, healing and Truth that flows in tandem and in harmony with your efforts, is very important and powerful. 

Walk in faith, my beloved friends. Walk in love. Allow whatever it is that God wishes to accomplish through you to flow and be unimpeded by your actions and senses of any particular situation. Be God’s innocent and open channel of Love. In this way, all is possible and nothing is restricted by your thoughts. You are here to act as God’s channels of Love, emissaries of Truth and instruments of blessings. Be together in harmony and love. As you link together in this way, in your prayers, in your efforts, in your thoughts, you become ever more powerful with each day, reaching out further each day and many, many souls will benefit from these simple prayers and efforts together. 

You are blessed, beloved souls, upon a path full of possibilities and potentials. You are doing God’s work. So with humility and trust and faith and love, you will travel together and do God’s bidding. May God bless you upon these travels. We are with you. Many, many angels are with you, beloved souls. Know that this is indeed a great blessing for you and for us to serve in this way. 

God bless you. I am Keea-atta Kem and I am with you. My love is with you and we will work together. May God bless you.
