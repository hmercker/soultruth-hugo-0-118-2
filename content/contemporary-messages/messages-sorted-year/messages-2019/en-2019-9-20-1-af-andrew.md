# Awaken to the Call

September 20<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Andrew received by Al Fike

This is Andrew. The world still continues to need your prayers. So I ask you, when you take time in prayer to pray for the world, to pray for those whom you know are in need, to pray for the blessing of God’s Love to enter your souls, to reach out to your brothers and sisters in love, to make efforts to sow Truth and Love wherever you may go. The world needs your efforts, beloved souls, needs your prayers, your love.

May you grow in His Light. May you awaken in His Love. May you seek to be an instrument of Light and Love. As you continue to progress upon this Path Divine, may your insights deepen, your understanding of Truth be awakened, and your capacity to love grow.

May God bless you, beloved souls. Know that an angel stands with each one of you, ready to assist you, ready to inspire, ready to be with you in prayer, ready to use you as an instrument of service, for Light and healing, Love and Truth in the world. For God works through His instruments, does He not?  We are just as much His instruments as are you. Though you continue to grow and discover your gifts, we continue to intensify and awaken all that is within us so that we may serve you more deeply, with greater love and greater insight, to walk with you, protect you, guide you.

May God’s Love find a deep and mighty inflowing into your souls, my beloved brothers and sisters. Awaken to the call, the call that tolls the bell to every soul to come to know Him, to come to know their own souls, and to come to know love in all its forms and glory and beauty, the highest of which is God’s Love.

May God bless you and keep you in His Light. I am your friend, Andrew. God bless you.
