I have come to bless you, to be with you in this Circle of Light for you have worked diligently to bring truths to this world, to help to awaken those souls who are drawn to the light that is here and to dedicate your time and efforts to fulfill God's Will. Precious and beloved souls, God will put before you many opportunities to serve in this way and in many ways in your world. You cannot and will not be able to count the ways in which God will use you and bring forth many opportunities to reach the souls of your brothers and sisters. For as you grow in the Love of God and have a great desire to love all those in your world, to be a channel of God's Love in the world, so God opens the opportunities to fulfill this desire of your soul and awaken the gifts of your soul so that when you are in the presence of others you will be able to manifest the grace and blessings and Will of God.

This is the fulfillment of what we have spoken to you of over these many years, bringing you in the midst of many diverse souls with many different perspectives and experiences in life. You have embraced all in love, accepted and reached out towards them with the truth of God's Love upon your lips, within your gaze, in your embrace. You have brought this light and love and those who are innocent and open and yearning have felt this embrace and this truth. God will guide to many who are in this place of yearning and receptivity. Be humble, beloved souls, do not restrict the flow of your efforts and work because you do not see what is possible to manifest as you move in the world, as you walk as God's instruments. Do not restrict the Will of God, beloved souls, but carry the great light, the torch, the flame of love wherever you go and it will light your way and warm the hearts of many and bring the power of truth to the souls of many.

Yes the power of God's Will within your lives increases. You begin to feel the impetus and impulses that are within the soul to move with this Will in many places and circumstances in the world. You will be guided, beloved souls, forever guided and this guidance is only restricted by your capacity to travel and act upon these visions and understandings and invitations from God to be in many places in your world. My beloved son continues to reach many souls. When he was on earth, he traveled a great deal. He went to the many souls who were receptive to his teachings. He was obedient to the Will of God and joyfully expressed that Will, that guidance with every day.

And so for each soul who truly desires to serve God and to know His Will so there is a need to put aside your own desires and inclinations in life and come to that perfect flow and plan that God has for you. In this you give up nothing, beloveds, but gain the world, gain the salvation of your soul through service and love, through awakening in love, through knowing God's Will, through the power of His Love. 

Seek to serve, beloveds, seek to allow God's Will to manifest in your lives and be the touchstone for all that you do. May it be in your love for God and your love for your brothers and sisters. In this depth of dedication, in this true understanding of what love may bring your lives will be filled with many possibilities and opportunities and God will provide the ways and the means for you to reach out and touch many. This is your destinies, beloved souls, this is your destinies, to be in that great river, that flow that God has designated for each of you. In your acceptance of His Will where you allow with each moment and each breath to be an instrument of His Will then there is great joy, fulfillment of the soul and  a beautiful light builds within you, a depth of wisdom and understanding of truth, an accumulation of the light of love within you. You need not worry of the details, you need not worry how you will be provided for in this life of yours for within God's perfect Will and designs for you. All is provided that is required and necessary for your needs of this world. It will come in a flow of grace and love from God.

May God bless you, beloveds. May you come to know God's Will for you and realize with great joy the possibilities and potentials of your soul. We are very pleased with your efforts, beloved souls, we are very pleased with how you have embraced God's Will for these moments together and come together in love and peace and joy. This is an example of living your lives in harmony with truth and love. You will continue to grow in this and awaken more deeply within this truth. God bless you, beloveds. I am Mary and I love you. I feel close to each and every one of you. You are my brothers and sisters in this world and I am close. God bless you, beloveds. Mary loves you. God bless you.
