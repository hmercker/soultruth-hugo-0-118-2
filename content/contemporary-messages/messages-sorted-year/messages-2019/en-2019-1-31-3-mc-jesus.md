Jesus received by Maureen Cardoso

Beloved souls I come, I am Jesus. 

*Our Mighty and Heavenly Father, I pray for these beloved souls who come together at this time to open themselves to receive a mighty inflowing of your Divine Love into their souls. Send your beautiful angels Heavenly Father to these souls, to assist them to feel the presence of your Love, to receive healing and to know your Presence from this moment forward. That your Love is available at all times and it is only for the yearning and the asking of the soul to open to your Love. Father help these beautiful souls to know you, to reach for you and to yearn for you. They are the workers of Earth, they are the ones who bring light to this world, they are the ones who yearn to help their brothers and sisters, and they are the ones who yearn to bring harmony upon Earth.  These are the souls that are part of your great plan for the many changes in this world. Bless them Father, bless them deeply.*

Beloved souls, I wish to let you know that when I walked this Earth my message was just this, to teach mankind to yearn for the Divine Love, the Essence of the Creator, for this great inflowing to come into their souls. Much of my message has been distorted. Beloved souls, this simple message of opening your soul and receiving the very Essence of the Creatorâ€™s Love will transform your soul. It will bring deep healing that no other way can, it will allow your soul to be awakened, it will bring forward your beautiful gifts that God has implanted within each of your souls to help in service, to share your love, to be guided and to know, to know your souls. 

The way of the soul is different than the way of the mind, beloveds. There is much distortion of truth from the mind. It is the soul that knows truth, recognizes truth, carries truth and can share truth. Beloved souls take time in your day, each day and be with God just as you are now in the silence of your heart in the feeling of your heart allowing your soul to be touched, to be blessed, to be changed and to be awakened by this Love. This is the way, beloveds; this is the way to awakening your soul. Allow God, your beloved Creator your Heavenly Father to touch you deeply and to bless every part of you upon our journey to at-onement with your beloved Creator.

God bless you beloveds, God bless you and keep you. I am Jesus, the Master of the Celestial Kingdom and I welcome each of you into this Circle of Light to be blessed by the Love of God.  God bless you, I am Jesus, God bless you.
