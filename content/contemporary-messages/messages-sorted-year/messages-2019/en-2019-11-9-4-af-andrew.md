Andrew received by Al Fike

I am Andrew. May the Father’s Love wash over each one of you. May you feel His Touch. May you absorb His Love so that you may come to see that God has given each of you an invitation to receive this gift, a gift that will be with you for all eternity, a gift that builds and expands and awakens all the beautiful aspects of your soul.

You are loved, beloved souls, you are loved. There is nothing else in the universe that will express this Love in such a way that you are never turned away, that you are never without this gift, given with your prayers and longing of the soul. Come to know this part of yourself, my beautiful friends. Come to know that the treasure that you lay up within your soul is the only thing that you might take with you as you transition to another plane of existence.That this Energy, this Essence of God, will inform your life, change your soul, awaken you to all that you are.

So my friends, with a simple prayer, “Beloved Creator, open my soul to an inflowing of Your Love. Awaken those parts of me that long for at-onement with You. Help me to truly come to know myself, all the goodness and wonderment that You have put within me, in Your Creation, Your deep and abiding Love for me.” With this prayer inviting God into your heart, you will come to know such joy and relief from your pains and your concerns. You will walk in Light. You will be able to bring to you many more blessings that God has to give. In this transformation that comes with this gift of Love, you will come to know the many gifts that God wishes for you to express in your lives.

In this expression will come the opportunities to serve humanity, to bring Truth, healing, peace, love, upliftment. It is so very simple, beloved souls. It is so very powerful in its Truth. Step forward and seek it and you will come to know these things which I speak of. It will become a truth and reality within your life, shifting all towards Light, shifting all towards Truth. Clarity, peace, and joy will come into your heart like you have never experienced before. It will burn and expand and be truly a part of you. May God bless you on that journey, beloved souls. May you come to know what it is that your souls truly long for. May you come to recognize and awaken to your true self.

God bless you beloved souls. God bless you. I am Andrew and I am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. I am one of the ones that walked with the Master Jesus as he spoke the Truth of Love. God bless you. My love is with you.
