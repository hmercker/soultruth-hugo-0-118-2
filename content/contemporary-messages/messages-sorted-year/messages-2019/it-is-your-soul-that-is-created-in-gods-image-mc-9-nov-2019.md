I am here, It is Mary. I bring to you my deepest love, my touch of grace, my showering of peace. For I have a deep and abiding love for all children of Earth. I watch over each and every soul upon Earth as a mother, as a nurturer, as one who comes when the child is wounded who offers love and comfort and shares the essence of her soul that has been redeemed by the Grace of the Heavenly Father. 

It is a great blessing you are all here, sharing in this Love that your beloved Creator, the way you see God and know God, comes to Touch you by this Love, comes to draw you close, and comes to awaken that part of you that has been created in His image. It is your soul, beloved children. It is your soul that may live forever, you who come to understand the power of this Love Divine that you may open to at any moment in time, open to receiving, open to be touched by. Your call is always answered without condition and in pure Essence of Love. It is this Love that I love you with and watch over you with. It is this Love that our beloved Jesus shares with you. It is this Love that all the Celestial teachers, those who live in the Celestial Heavens share, teach, and care for the children of Earth. 

You are in a time of awakening. Many changes are happening upon your Earth. Some that are very challenging and difficult to watch and see. Please know, us in the spirit world are involved in many ways of helping the balancing come back. Your Earth will once again live in harmony. So we need all Lightworkers that you are, to awaken, to share love, to be harmonious and to live in peace. It is this Essence of God’s Love that will transform you, beloveds. Your souls have been long here. Your souls know what they need, what they are drawn to, this Divine Essence. 

It is often the mind that will resist and even reject, for the power of the mind can be very distracting. Yet as your soul begins to awaken by the power of this Love, great harmony will come within your being. With enough of this Love living in your soul, your mind will be changed as well and will desire to serve your soul. For when your mind is in harmony with your soul through the wisdom, the Truth and the guidance that your soul carries, great peace will exist within you. So your awakening, dear and beloved souls, as Lightworkers upon Earth, is vital. As you gather here, learning of the Divine Essence, we ask that you continue to nurture your soul with this Love. We guide you to tune into the wisdom that is within your being and allow this Love to change you, allowing your soul to be transformed into the Divine. 

I am with each of you. You are each unique and special, each one needed, each one loved deeply by the Beloved Creator, our Heavenly Father. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is always with you and I watch over you, precious as you are to me. I am Mary, the mother of Jesus and my love is with you. God bless you.
