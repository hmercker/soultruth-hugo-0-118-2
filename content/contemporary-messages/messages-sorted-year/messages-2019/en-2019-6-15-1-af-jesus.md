# We Shall Commune with God Together

June 15<sup>th</sup>, 2019

General Collection, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Precious and beloved souls, I come. I am Jesus. You are in the Light of Godâ€™s Presence at this moment, beloved souls. The Peace of God flows upon you like a mantel, a cloak of Light. Open your souls beloveds, to the inflowing of His Love. Be in this Light and we shall commune with God together.

Seek His council and you will know the way of your life guided by God. Express love, love in all that you do and all that you are and you will know joy in every moment. Release all that is not in harmony with love. This is the way of Truth. Love is what leads you there beloveds, where all knowledge and Truth comes from the awakened soul and all that is of spiritual sustenance comes from the Essence of God within.

Beloved and beautiful friends, join me in this communion. Allow all that is of God to be with you at this moment and together we will ascend into great Light and Love, peace and healing, kindling the joy in our hearts and the wisdom of our souls.

May God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. I shall always be with you, beloved souls. God bless you. I love you. God bless you.
