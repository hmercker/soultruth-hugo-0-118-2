# Focus on God's Will and Have Faith

January 4<sup>th</sup>, 2019

FUSC Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mark received by Al Fike

I am your spiritual leader and guardian, Mark. Today we gather together to mark a new year for our beloved church, to bring the cleansing and the changes to this place so that all that God intends for this church shall come to be. You beloved souls constitute the heart of this church, the wisdom of this church, the expression of love for this church, though there are some others who join you in this. You are like a council of wisdom for the future of this place that has been endowed with many gifts and blessings from God. So you carry a great responsibility, beloved children. A responsibility to uphold the light, to uphold the truth within this place so that all who enter the doors, the threshold, may be blessed.

It is the power of the light of your souls, beloveds, that bring the light and peace as God’s instruments to this place. You carry the dedication of your souls to God in order to bring these blessings forth. Work together, beloved souls. Work as one. Work to bring harmony. As your souls resonate together in love, so all challenges that will come will be met and overcome with love.

There will be changes within the structure of your church. Some will leave, for they do not find that their needs are met, though these needs be of the mind, not the soul. Many others are coming where they feel drawn by the love, that they find sanctuary in this place, peace, nurturance of the soul and the heart. You see, my brothers and sisters, though many believe that the great importance of your work there is to teach various ideas and concepts of the spirit and truth, it is to embrace your brothers and sisters in love, as this is your foundation and your strength. All other issues will dissipate with your loving grace, harmonious embrace of all.

All disagreements, friction, fear, error, dissipates with love. This you must carry with you always when you are working together for this cause, for this sanctuary of peace. Yes, you are responsible to uphold the physical structure of this place, to keep things in good order. Those are your material responsibilities, but this is in order to maintain the opportunity for light and blessings to come in this place blessed by God.

Remember, beloved souls, precious lights all, to be a channel of love in the world, to be a beacon of light in the world, to put aside your thoughts that are not of love, your disagreements that may indicate a variance of ideas of the mind. Within your hearts, each one, is the power of love glowing and growing within you. And this flame that constitute a great light amongst you, you must support with one another. Pray together. Speak in terms of love. Speak in terms of the knowings of your heart and souls, where God speaks to you and guides you forward. In this way, the strength and light of this church shall indeed grow and expand beyond your imaginations.

You will cause change, important change, in your part of the world through your efforts. For this place becomes a beacon of light, waves of light that pulsate out through your city and your area affecting many. Yes, the work that you do there is wide-ranging and all-encompassing on many, many levels of reality and expression. This is God’s plan, beloveds, that a great beacon of light be established, this portal that brings many, many blessings, important and necessary for the well-being of your world. You will see that what you establish there will be a template for other places which God intends to establish in your world.

As you beloved souls work together with a clarity and a purpose, a deep faith and a deep love, you will accomplish what you may consider miracles, deep healings, manifestations of spirit, beautiful lights, and the Presence of God in your midst. Is this not the goal of every church of God, to have the manifestations and blessings of God so powerful and deep, so beautiful, that many will fall on their knees in wonderment, will know such deep grace, their hearts touched so powerfully that it will change their lives? This is doing God’s work. God has provided the place and the means for this to be accomplished. But first, you must tread softly but firmly. Establish the light within this place in every way and aspect, that love and acceptance will flourish, that conflict will not.

It is good that you come together, beloved brothers and sisters, to speak your mind, to share your vision, to be as one in this work together. God has brought you together because your souls desire this. You know this is what is meant to be in your lives. God has given you a great opportunity, beloved souls, to be a clear and pure channel of love, to be His instruments, to listen and enact the Will of God.

Beloved souls, you will be guided, protected, upheld, blessed. There will be no dilemma, no situation that will be beyond your capacities to bring to resolution and harmony. This I promise you, my beloved brothers and sisters. As one who guards over this church, I tell you that God’s Will will be done. Peace will reign. Love will flow. You need not worry or concern yourselves of those who may desire to cause disruption and disharmony. Your strength, beloved souls, is far greater than these conditions which concern you. You will see how resolution comes about in surprising ways, in beautiful healing love, in wise and considered solutions. We will help you and guide you upon all matters. Ask for our help and it will come.

Be of great faith and God shall move mountains and clear pathways and eliminate any and all obstructions. You are about to enter a great adventure, seeing the unfolding of the power of love, together and with your brothers and sisters who join you.

May you be blessed, my brothers and sisters, beautiful souls. May the Light of God’s Love continue to pour upon you. May you come to know the great power of your soul awakened in love, the beauty and glory of your relationship with your Heavenly Father, Creator of all, Source of all Love. Blessed be the peacemakers. Blessed be those who venture forth in the world and carry the banner of love. Blessed are those who love God above all else and bring love wherever they go. You shall be blessed, beloveds. You shall be blessed.

I am with you. Mark loves you. Continue in your efforts and walk in light. God bless you.
