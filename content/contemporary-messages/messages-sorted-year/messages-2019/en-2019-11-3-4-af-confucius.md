# Healing and Blessings for the Journey

November 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Punalu'u, Oahu, HI, USA

Confucius received by Al Fike

I am Confucius and I bring a gift of healing for each one of you, beloved souls, to help sustain you in the week to come, a blessing, a gift from God. You will feel renewed energy and sense of well-being. Your bodies will feel a little lighter and your demeanor will be of joy.

Godâ€™s gift of healing is for all and is given abundantly for those who beseech God for this support and harmony created with His gentle Touch upon your bodies and spirits and souls. God wishes for each of you to be uplifted, to walk in the world as a Light, to not be burdened or downtrodden, but to be in joy and peace, to walk with love and wisdom. Indeed, blessed are the children who walk in this Truth. Know that great resources of Love and healing are available to each one of you, beloved souls, for the asking. In your prayers, in your attitudes, as you walk through life, God will bless you and uplift you and guide you.

Much can be given and much can flow through you, beloved souls, as you continue to lift yourselves up into the Light, to seek the highest blessings, to be in harmony and at-onement with God. In this way, nothing can hold you in darkness or strife. You will know great relief and great joy in this most powerful of Blessings from God.

God bless you. Confucius loves you, beloved souls. I am with you often.
