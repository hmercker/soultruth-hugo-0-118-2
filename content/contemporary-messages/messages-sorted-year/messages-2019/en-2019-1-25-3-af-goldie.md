# Feel the Joy of Communing

January 25<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Angels' Q&A Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

How happy we are that you are together, beloved souls, and that more are coming. I want you to know that we are making it possible to open doors and possibilities that you may gather in harmony and not be distracted by the daily life that pulls you hither and yon. Feel the joy of communing with your brothers and sisters in loving prayer, the joyful acknowledgement of life, life of the soul, the life that bubbles forth within you, the life that comes from God, and bringing your soul to that place of truly knowing and being in love. I am with you too. I will be in your dreams. I will be in your prayers. I will be everywhere because I love you. We all have our jobs to do, do we not? And I will do mine in joyful abandon, in loving caresses, and kisses.

God bless you, beloved friends. God bless you. Goldie loves you.
