Your teacher Augustine here. Thank you dear beloved daughter for your efforts in song and prayer and in bringing light to the world. You will find, my beloved brothers and sisters, that great Light is coming to the world through many different channels and in many different ways, because it is the time for the souls to awaken. God will use many instruments in order to awaken souls, in order to teach souls of Truth and Light and understanding. 

You have found your way to this Circle of Light and so you have come to beseech God to receive the Great Blessing of Divine Love, the Essence of His Great Soul. As you continue to seek and as you continue to pray and open to this Blessing and to many blessings, you will find that you will come to meet many who are also seeking, who are also channels of Love and blessings in the world. Though they may not speak your language, they may not understand the way you understand your path to God, still, within their souls and within your soul is a resonance, a common language, a common understanding that is of God and of the universe in which you live. 

So, my beloved souls, continue to be open and receptive to all things that are of light and come to embrace your brothers and sisters, to see with the eyes of your souls that we are all children of God and that we are all together in this great journey of soul awakening, seeking at-onement with the Great Source of all and that on your path, it is the power and the wonderment of the Divine Essence that opens these doors, awakens these sensibilities within you. May you all continue to seek out the Truth, seek out God, and seek for this blessing for your soul. 

God’s great desire is that you awaken to Light, to Love, that you will know the peace and the joy, that you will know the Truth and the Light. God will carry you there, beloved souls. Each of you are in the firm grasp of God who uplifts you, upholds you, and carries you into Light. May God bless you upon that journey, the journey that we are all travelling, holding one another’s hand, supporting one another upon that road and coming to that place of Light through our prayers and our desires and our efforts to be in the Light. 

May God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine and I walk with you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
