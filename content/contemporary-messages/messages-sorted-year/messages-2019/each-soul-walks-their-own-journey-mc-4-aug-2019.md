I am Guru Nanak. Yes my daughter, thank you for sharing the experience of the dear soul who found the garden that is named after me. There is much healing that is brought to this place for those who visit and it brings me great joy to see those souls come to this place and be touched by the healing Essence of Love that is there. My dear friends, these religions that separate you upon this Earth, is to some degree unfortunate, yet every soul has the opportunity to learn and to grow, which is how Love, the Essence of God’s Love upon a soul, unites all beings. 

As you walk this Earth knowing of this great Essence of the Divine, you are indeed mightily blessed. And we from this side of life, use each of you in many ways. As you are before those beautiful people who follow various religions, there are blessings upon the soul given that you are not aware of. It is through your instrumentality that God can bless many and plant seeds into their souls. When such souls come into this side of spirit and hear of this great news of the Divine Love, there is some recollection. Though they may not understand from where, but somehow this Truth sits well in their soul. Though it may be a slow journey to the Truth of the Divine Love Path, this is a beginning for this soul.  

And we on this side of spirit, as you well know, who are on this path come to help many. When those souls follow let’s say, the Sikh tradition and they see those of their Gurus, their teachers, who they so revere, will be coming to them with these teachings and these understandings and guidance, so they are more open, more open to what we say than perhaps would be from a visit from a soul who is much brighter and further along on the Divine Love Path that they do not have a connection with.

So your work on Earth is very instrumental and is greatly needed for it assists us on this side of spirit in helping all souls come to the Light. Though I speak on behalf of all the religious leaders who walked your Earth teaching what they understood as truth and those teachings that many still follow while they are on Earth, I speak on behalf of all of these great spiritual teachers and leaders the importance of your instrumentality in sharing with many of these people who follow other traditions. Allow this Love that is within your souls to be activated, to radiate from you, to touch another. Look deeply into their eyes and allow your soul to touch their soul. Allow the essence of you, the love that you carry to touch them. Some you will see very wounded, the sadness in their eyes. And some, dear friends, you will see the brightness and the light that they carry and your eyes will dance in the light of this love. For you will recognize their light and the brightness of their essence.

It is a great blessing to share these teachings and these truths of Divine Love with all. Please do not judge or condemn others for their path. Each soul walks their journey just as you have and you are. If you are to observe what has been your journey and the many changes and shifts along your path and how you have arrived at this great Truth of Divine Love, you will have compassion for all souls who are yet to learn of this Truth. 

So your work is to embrace and to love, to understand and to empathize, to share. Each of you are at a different place upon your journey. Yes and even those who understand and have the great knowledge of this Truth, Divine Love, are in a process of awakening. You all are, beloveds. So you need to be compassionate and loving towards one another as well. As you are but you can always do more. 

My message to you, beloveds, is one of great appreciation and gratitude, one where souls such as myself, who taught, who led many people on Earth through the truths that I was given. It is a great privilege to work with souls such as yourself, who carry a very high truth and who are workers for God. We all work together. 


I am Guru Nanak and my great blessing of love comes to you, beautiful souls who are filled with the Love of God, whose lights expand, who emanate truth and touch many. God bless each one of you. I am Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh tradition. God bless you all.

**NOTE.**  Guru Nanak (1469 - 1539) was the founder of the Sikh religion and Guru Nanak is said to have travelled far and wide across Asia teaching people the message of ik onkar ('one God'), who dwells in every one of his creations and constitutes the eternal Truth. With this concept, he would set up a unique spiritual, social, and political platform based on equality, fraternal love, goodness, and virtue.
