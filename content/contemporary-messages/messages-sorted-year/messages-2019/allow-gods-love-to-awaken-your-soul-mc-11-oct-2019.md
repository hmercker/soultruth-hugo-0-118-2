Received by Maureen Cardoso


God bless you, beloved souls. I join you in your circle where you long to draw in the Love of God into your soul. As you sit in the circle and focus upon the essence of your soul being touched by the Grace of God, the power of your longing and yearning draws forth the Divine Love into your soul. It draws forward the Celestial angels, bright spirits and spirits of all spheres on our side of life. 

My name is Lotus Blossom. I join you this evening and wish to share with you some inspiration and Truths of the Divine Love. For this Essence of God is a true and real thing, a living water, a living bond, a living Essence, the highest gift given by God to His beloved children, a link that will draw the soul of every child back to God. With this awareness of this Love coming within the soul and bestowing the soul with the grace, and the healing, and the purity of this Love, an awareness within your soul grows. An awakening of the soul begins to flower and an unfolding of a journey where your soul will continue to desire to be in communion with God. For when your soul receives this Love, it is like a thousand rays of sunshine bringing warmth, and peace, love, great contentment. 

As the soul experiences this extraordinary bliss, it desires more. You will find, should you devote time in your day in prayer and meditation with God, that a great desire will fill your soul, longing to come to know more deeply about this Love and this connection, this immediate connection, with the One who has created you. It is a very dynamic relationship that awaits each and every child of God. It is a relationship that will continue for all eternity. 

Oh my dear friends, your friends in the Celestial Heavens continue to yearn, to come closer to God. We desire to know more than we already know, of our beloved Creator. It is as though we are locked in with God, linked in, yet we know there is more. For our soul continues to rest with God, to expand in the Truths of God and to fill ourselves with an awareness of the expanding ways of God. 

So as you, beloved souls, sit here in your circle, opening your heart, longing from your soul, this true place, your true self longing from there, we come with our love, and our light and our gifts to assist you. We ask that you humbly fall into grace and acknowledge the soul that you are. Allow your conscious mind to embrace your soul, to release your soul. Allow your soul to be expressed, to receive the great fire of God's Love to burn away all those things that are not of love that hold you back, that are filled with fear and error. These things that can come from the mind, through your lives’ experiences, which you hold onto tightly, resisting the urge to forgive. 

I wish to direct you into the arms of God and to open to a beautiful blessing of Love, where forgiveness will be possible, pains released and healed and thoughts of the mind that disturb and destroy can too be released. Experience this Love, beloveds. 
Experience the Truth of this Love in all its potentials. God awaits you and God responds immediately to your soulful request, an outcry. 

May you all receive the peace, the love, and the joy that this Love brings. I am Lotus Blossom, and my love is with each and every one of you. God bless you.
