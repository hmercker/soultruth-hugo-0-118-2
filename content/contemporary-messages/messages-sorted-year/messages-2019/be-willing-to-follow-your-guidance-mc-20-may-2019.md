I am Matthew. I join you in this time of prayer, where you open your souls, longing for Divine Love to bless your souls, for this great Essence to come and change the very being of who you are. As you walk your individual path to be close to your beloved Creator, you do so in the seeking and the yearning of your soul. For there is a deep curiosity, a deep desire to know your beloved Creator, to know deeply this Love and this communion and connection at the level of your soul.  Each of you in your unique ways, are reaching to God and with God blessing each of you, helping you along your way, helping you to choose well, to be aware of what you choose and to be reflective upon what you choose. 

For God is always there beloveds, always there. It is only you who choose to not reach to God. In this way you may feel separated or distant, but you may be reassured that your beloved and Heavenly Creator is always there waiting for your call, for your sincerity to ask for help and guidance upon your path. You must have a willingness to hear and to listen and to follow that which is given in guidance and promptings, for as you do this, you enact out the guidance, the inspirations and the insights given. You will find your connection to God growing ever more deeply in your life and you will realize that the hand of God is guiding you and you may reach out at any moment. 

Your lives are becoming very rich in a spiritual way, that deep place within you awakening by the Grace of receiving the gift of Divine Love. When a soul is awakened in such a way, the potentials are limitless. There is no end to the wonderment of the gifts and treasures in the life that you will experience. It is important to discipline your minds, to keep them upon the Grace of God, to keep your thoughts high in nature, to enact patience, compassion, empathy and grace towards yourself and toward others. This is doing Godâ€™s work, beloveds. For you need to embrace yourself deeply, allowing those parts in you that carries some darkness, to be released and blessed by the Grace of this Love. And then, in that place in you, this Love that you have longed for, will reside within you. 

As this Love continues to nourish your souls, you will see deep change come, bit by bit by bit. If you were to look back one year from now, the person you were, the decisions you made, the thinking that you had, you will see to a great measure, the effect that this Love has had upon your life. And so it goes, beloveds. Continue to walk your walk hand in hand, reaching to the beloved Creator, being guided, allowing your angel friends to be near you, to serve you and to bring their love to you. 

It is what God desires of you, beloveds, for your love to be expressed towards God, for your loving essence to come so deeply to understand and know the Essence of God. This is what God desires and wishes, for this deep and rich communion with each child. 

I am Matthew and my love is with you. It is wonderful to come and speak to you, to encourage you upon your path, and to share my love with you. God bless you. I am Matthew. God bless you.
