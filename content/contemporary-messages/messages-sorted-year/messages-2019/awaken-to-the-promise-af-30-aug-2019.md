August 30<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

I am your teacher Augustine and I welcome you to this Circle of Light, this place that has been blessed by the angels and touched by God. A great Portal of Light is established in this room. All of these things you may take advantage of while you are here together in circle and prayer. These are blessings that God has bestowed upon this place as a result of the prayers and efforts of those who live here and those who have prayed here and may be given as a gift to your souls if you but open yourselves to the flowing of God’s Love, to the Touch of God’s Touch so that you may be uplifted from this condition of the Earth plane to a condition of Light and Love. 

It is yours for the asking, my friends. It is a powerful Gift to merely say with sincere desire: *“God, open my soul to the inflowing of your Divine Essence. May the Holy Spirit touch my soul conveying the Essence of God to my soul.”* Can you not feel the power of this Love? Can you not come to know the blessing that this Love brings, that awakens many things within you, that carries a great promise that you and God may come together in at-onement? This is the power and the gift and the beauty of God’s Blessing upon you. Do you wish to receive this Blessing, beloved souls? Have you come to be within the Grace of God’s Touch? 

Focus your desires. Focus the yearnings of your soul and receive in response to this simple effort to reach God, the Source of All, and to open the channels for this Gift to come. As you do so, the great flood of Love will wash over you and help to heal all that is not in harmony, all the hurts and pains of your world, the condition that is here and is not meant to be. So all will come to love. All will be in harmony. This is the promise. This is the gift. 

May you come to know it deeply within you. For you need not just pray here. You may pray anywhere, at any time, to receive this gift and it will be given, provided you are sincere with your desires. God does not hold anything back from His children. God is eager to give you the bounty that is of His Soul to each of you. Breathe it in, beloved souls. Receive from your heart. Be in the Grace of God and all else will fall away in this sacred time together. 

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine and I am with you in this time of prayer and communion as are many angels and many spirits, many spirits who are connected to each one of you. Those who have gone before you, they come and be with you now in this great Light, in this great hall. May God bless us all. May God indeed bless your souls. Awaken to the promise and all will come easily and in abundance. God bless you.
