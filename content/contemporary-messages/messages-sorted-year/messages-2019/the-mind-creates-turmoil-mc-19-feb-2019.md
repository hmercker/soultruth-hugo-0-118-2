God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine. Your prayers are heard and they reach to God in their sincerity. Please know, my dear son, that your prayer for the dear soul who has entered the Earth journey, your prayer for Divine Love to bless this dear soul is heard and realized. And yes, please keep praying for this dear soul for this is a way that you may help to bring love to this newborn child.

My friends, yes, your prayers go out for healing for many which include your world leaders. A prayer for balancing and harmonization of soul and mind, for it is the mind that creates much turmoil in your world as we have told you many, many times. My dear friends you know the way to awakening your souls and healing that which is preventing your soul from shining its light forward - this is powerful key. And then there is the way of the mind which is what dominates the operation of your world. It is unfortunate that the mind of many is undisciplined, full of greed and self-fulfilling acts. It does seem a very large task, does it not, in order to bring harmony to your world on this grand scale? For your world leaders to lead in unity and to have the good of their fellow brothers and sisters in the heart of matters  - yes this is unfortunate and it does bring much darkness and turmoil to your world.

I wish to encourage you to not let this overcome you and bring you into greater darkness. For my dear friends, first and foremost you are responsible for yourselves. As you bring God’s Love into your soul, which establishes an awakening in your soul and you discipline your mind using the various techniques that are available for disciplining the mind, you will come into harmony and will be able to enact God’s purpose for you. Though it may seem that you are but one soul, it is very important, you as that one soul making effort to cleanse the darkness that is there in the soul and to balance your minds bringing your thoughts to God, bringing your thoughts upon high things. This is very important to do, beloveds, and this is your individual work.  

Take the responsibility that God has placed in your hands for your life and allow all the changes that occur within you to emanate out into the world and to be a shining example for all those that come into your midst. We understand that this is a very big task, but it is the most important task that you can take part in, aligning yourself with God. As you do this, you will see that many doors open and you will see that you have the strength and the ability to walk through the doors that God opens for you, to share the way you have reached greater awakening in your soul and the responsibility you have taken to discipline your minds and to care for your body as well bringing a harmonization into these three parts of you.  

This will show others and your light will shine so brightly you will attract many. It is always difficult to recognize one's own light, one’s own brilliance and one’s own gifts, but beloveds, others will see this and they will be drawn to you. You will have the courage, the heart and the desire to speak the truth in the way that you have come to that point in your life where your soul shines brightly and you have peace of mind. This is a guarantee on this path, beloveds, it is a guarantee. For as you continue to pray and receive the great gift of Divine Love into your soul, alignment will come. It does require your continued efforts. It does require your discipline, but my friends, what is there in your life that is more important that this? 

Your material world has many distractions. We understand this, but bring into your awareness that these material things are fleeting. You cannot take them when you pass onto our side of spirit. It is your soul and your spirit body that will remain. Each day take time and let God bless you. Allow the blessings of God to come into your soul. Allow the blessings of God’s Love to awaken you. Allow these potentials that sit within your soul, these gifts implanted, allow them to be realized while you are here on Earth. Bless yourselves, my dear friends. Recognize the gift that you are. You are a gift to yourself and you are a gift to others and you are a gift to God.  

It is good that you come together in prayer in this way for it helps to strengthen yourselves as light workers here upon Earth.  We are very pleased at how these Circles of Light are expanding and reaching many.

God bless each and every one of you beloveds. I am Augustine your teacher and I stand with you, guide, influence and teach you. My love is with you ever more, God bless you.
