March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2019

Soul Awakening Tour Eastern US, Manhattan, NY, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

….through the tortuous and treacherous path of life and find light. Each one of you I promise, will find light in your lives and know the joy of the upliftment of God bringing you to that place of truth and salvation from these earthly conditions to a place of joy and peace. Blessed are those who come with humility but determination that light shall be in their lives, that they will live not in darkness but light, not in fear but joy, not in ignorance but truth. That they may be in light and love, the Grace of God to uplift and carry them forth in life. Blessed are you beloveds. Blessed are you who carry the lantern of light. You will come to know my words and understand the greatness of God’s Love. Blessed are you who seek love and truth. Blessed are you.
