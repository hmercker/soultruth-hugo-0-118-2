This is Augustine. I have been in the Celestial Kingdom for many hundreds of years and continue to grow in this Light of God’s Love. Beloved souls, settle into the peace of God’s Presence that is with you. Breathe in the Breath of God, which is His Love. Allow yourselves to be enveloped in this Light. It is the power of God’s Touch that must be the foundation and beginnings of any spiritual exploration. For without the Light and Grace of God, much can be misconstrued and misunderstood upon that journey for Truth. 

Ask to be guided. Ask for your soul to awaken. Ask for truth. But most of all, ask to be blessed with this Great Gift of Divine Love which will open the faculties of your soul, awaken the gifts that are within and open to the possibilities of communication with God and with the angels. It is not a difficult thing, but it requires focus, dedication, and faith. For without your application of will and desire, to trust and open yourselves to what God has to give to you, the possibility of communicating with we, in the Celestial Kingdom, is slim. 

Yes we do come to try to influence mortals, but often that influence is lost in the great flow and chatter of the mind and the mindful, thoughtful currents of your world. Here we ask you to be quiet, to listen, to attune yourselves so that you may indeed come to know us and come to know God. Remember that the way is simple, but the application of this Truth is often difficult for mortals who walk this Earth constantly distracted, constantly finding obstructions, in a state where all is fast and intense and distracting. Calm yourselves and be at peace. Know that what comes in this reaching for God, has great value and purpose and is necessary for a soul to be in harmony. 

If you but follow this simple request to receive this simple gift, you will find your way through many storms and many circuitous distractions to a place where Light reigns supreme and Love becomes the great foundation of your life. For a soul who is serious in their desires and efforts to come to that place of Grace, nothing will detract them or keep them from this. The power of your own soul’s desire, the power of your intentions, both conscious and buried deep within your soul, will always lead you to the Source of Light. Even in times of trouble and difficulty you will have the ability and the strength to come to this place of peace and replenishment, of Love and joy. In that place, we are there to greet you, to accompany you. For we are your friends and helpers, your guides and healers who are eager to utilize our gifts, our wisdom, our capacities to uphold you and uplift you and to give to you in whatever way is possible. 

Remember you restrict the possibilities. You hold yourself back by your condition of light, the conditions of your thoughts, and all that which is not in harmony with God. This is the human condition and it is powerful. It has a powerful hold on all of you who live in this world of yours. It is a struggle. It is a challenge. But what is worth having that is not worth the effort, the desire and the application to receive it? 

God will not force anything upon you. So much is blamed on God. But indeed God has all good will for you, for your lives and for your wellbeing. It is the human condition that makes it difficult for God to reach you and for you to be in harmony with your life and your being. So is this not the basis for spiritual pursuit, to be uplifted, to walk in Light, to know truth, to know joy, love and all good things in a life and all good things that may be expressed in your life? 

We are always there to help you to come to that place of Light and peace and joy. Know this, my beloved friends. Know that all the blessings and treasures of the spirit and the soul are offered to you. Provided you accept and strive to receive, they are given, given freely and in abundance. It is for you to decide. It is for you to set aside that which holds you from this. It is your responsibility and that which God puts upon you to choose, to step forward in Light. In this way once you make that first step, all good things, all beautiful blessings, all that is of Light and Love will come to you. 

This will not change the conditions of the world and the challenges that are of this world, but it will certainly change your perception of them and your ability to cope with them. For in your heart you will sing with joy. In your consciousness you will know and act with wisdom. In your countenance you will express Love and Light. In this way you will indeed change some of the conditions of your world. Given enough individuals who are willing to walk a path of Light and Love, you will change the world. You will reverse the tide of darkness and bring Light. In so doing your life will change in ways you cannot imagine. Your journeys will be surprising and wonderful. All these things God offers to you, beloveds. All these things are available to you, given with a mere prayer and desire to connect and receive from the Creator.

May you find your way, beloved souls, to that place of truly knowing and understanding of what I speak and know that we will be with you and that you will never be alone. When you are with God, you are never alone, but will know the Grace, the wonderment, the joy of His Love. May you receive this Gift and come to know this Gift as part of your life and come to know us as friends and helpers who will indeed help to clear the way for you and bring your life into harmony. May God bless you with His Love. May you feel this Blessing and absorb it and come to know it. We are with you and our love and support are with you. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Augustine and I come as a teacher to your souls. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.
