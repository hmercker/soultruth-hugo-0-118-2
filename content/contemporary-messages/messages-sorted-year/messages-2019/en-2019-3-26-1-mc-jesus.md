# Blessing from Jesus

March 26<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Blackpool, UK

Jesus received by Maureen Cardoso

I come. I am Jesus. May a great blessing be bestowed upon the dear child this morning, speaking from her heart, casting out the prayers of healing for many. You feel my presence. You felt my presence arise and come. Thank you for holding your union with God so strong that could allow me to make a rapport, to come and touch and bless these dear souls. To hear the prayer in my mother tongue of Aramaic was a great joy and may the dear soul be deeply blessed by God’s healing Love.

You feel the strength of the Portal here in this beautiful, beautiful sanctuary. Blessed are thee who are following the Will of God and now allowing the presence of God’s Love to touch all. Blessed are thee. I walk with you, my daughter, and I lift you in the Light of God’s Love. Thy Will be done in this place. I am joyed by the transformation, by witnessing greater love and harmony. May all you, my disciples, continue to strengthen yourselves by the Grace of God’s Love and walk a soulful path to teach the many who God will place before you.

My dear brothers and sisters, I walk with you. I am Jesus and my love is with you. God bless you.
