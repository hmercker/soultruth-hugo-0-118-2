God bless you, beloved souls, I am Andrew. It is by the strength of your soul that you carry the light. No matter what the conditions are that you may encounter in this world, it is the strength of your soul that will uplift you, the basis of that great faith that you carry and that beautiful light within you. When all else is stripped away, this light remains and this strength carries you forward. It is the power of God’s Touch upon your soul that will ensure that any and all conditions of your material world will not diminish you, beloved souls. For those who are reliant upon the mind and the conditions and insistence of the mind for its comfort and routines and ideas and perceptions are vulnerable to the earthly conditions.

Yet beyond your minds comes this strength of soul, comes from that place that will indeed hold up against any winds that try and buffet you and take you from your foundation, your anchorage with God. You are all strong, beloved souls. You will continue to move forward in light. You will continue to uphold others in light and be God’s channels of Light and Love in the world. These conditions that come in your world are challenging indeed and challenge each one of you at certain times in your life. But you have held up and you have seen your own strength and you have perceived what is important in light, what things in your life are of great value. 

It is that strength and perception and beauty of soul that will help you in times of crisis, of grief and sorrow, for God is there in these times as well. His utmost blessings and upliftment are there for you during these times for God does not leave you ever. God is always there. When difficult times come upon you and your soul beseeches God for comfort, God does not turn away. God is there and will continue to be there in ever greater presence of Light and Love, of comfort and peace. 

You are not alone, none of you, no matter what you struggle with, beloved souls. No you are not alone. But indeed the world challenges each one of you in one way or another but you are not alone. The power of His Love is the power of healing and grace, of peace and truth. It is for you all. It is a great benediction of God that carries you in Light. May you continue to receive this gift and know that you are truly loved, truly loved and never alone.

God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. I am Andrew. I am with you. My love is with you and great caring pours upon each one of you, uplifting and upholding, healing and bringing peace. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds
