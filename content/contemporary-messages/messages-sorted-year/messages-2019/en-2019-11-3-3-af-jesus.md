November 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Punalu'u, Oahu, HI, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am Jesus. The Will of the Heavenly Father is that you love Him, that in your love for Him you open the door for His great Essence of Love to inflow into your souls. That as you come and be a part of this great River of Love which is God's Blessing to all His beautiful children, you will find your place within thiss great river and be carried along it finding for yourselves that you are truly loved and that all that is love will be yours.

You will come to understand the great hierarchy of Love that is in all of Creation. You will come to understand the power of love as it motivates all in the universe. You will come to understand the transformative qualities of the Essence of God’s Soul that brings the movement towards harmony in all things and in all souls. Seek this highest gift, beloved souls, and you will come to know all that you need to know, all that is possible to know, all that there is to know that is of Truth. For it is the power of Love, the power of God’s Love within your souls that will open the door to these many blessings that will awaken your souls to all Truth, all goodness and all that is in harmony with God’s Creation and with Love.

I compel you all, beloved souls, to seek the Gift above all gifts, to walk in this Truth and make this your daily walk, your daily bread, your daily succour, so that you will join all of us in some time to come in the realms of the Celestial Kingdom and be within that place of great Love and harmony, of Truth and joy. It is God's promise to you all, beloved souls. It is God's Blessings to all who wish to receive. It is the Path opened to every soul who desires to walk upon it with faith. Step your foot upon this path and walk with me and all who are within the flow of this mighty River of Love and be in harmony with all that is and all that you are in God's Creation.

My blessings to you, beloved souls. I give to you my love. I give to you my prayers. I give to you an embrace and say to you, *“you are my brother, you are my sister and I shall walk with you always”*. My love is with you. God's Love is with us all and we will continue to walk his splendid path towards atonement. God bless you.  I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you.
