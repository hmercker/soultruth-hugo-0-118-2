January 21<sup>st</sup>, 2019

General Collection, West Vancouver, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Maureen Cardoso

I come, I am Jesus.  May the Fatherâ€™s Love wash over you and through you in great abundance. May this Love cleanse you and bring comfort and healing. May the Love of the Creator find a constant inflowing into your soul and may this Love emanate through every part of you and fill you.

Beloved souls, may you use this Love as your guide as you step, each step in your day and in your life. Let this Love be your guiding post. Allow this Love to be a measure with everything that you do and you will find there is great peace and great comfort that comes to you and settles within you. Beloveds, be with your Heavenly Father and drink of this Love, these Living Waters constantly. Allow this Love to wash your souls clean.

I bring a blessing to each of you here, a special light, a gift, a blessing. Walk as I walked upon this Earth, beloveds. Do your very best. Allow this Love to bless everything that you do. I walk with each of you and pray for you.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Jesus. God bless you.
