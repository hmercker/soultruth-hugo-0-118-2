Received by Maureen Cardoso



I join you in your Circle of Light. You know me as Pope John Paul and I would like to come and let you know that now I am a Celestial Angel working for God. I always worked for God though now I work in greater Truth. I am one who does help to influence the leaders in the Church who help to bring change to that which is in error and also the great suffering of the priests in their actions of error. As you well know as they pass over into spirit they will have the opportunity to pay their compensation and have their souls cleansed of their errors.

It was not difficult for me when Jesus came before me telling me the Truth of who he is and the Truth of who God is. This was not difficult for me to accept. In my love of God and desire to serve, I dedicated my time in prayer to receive the Love of God and to have the errors and conditions that I carried cleansed.

My daughter who shared her vision after the morning prayer, saying she feels guided to approach those who she knows from these childhood connections and share the Truth that you know, the Truth of the Divine Love, with those who serve in the Church, I am here to ask you to follow your guidance. It is part of your purpose and to let you know that many in spirit are around you and will guide you and you will not be alone as you step forward with this purpose. In the times of being overwhelmed, be in your soul, dear child, for your soul knows and understands its purpose and it would be your mind that becomes nervous and questions. I only ask that you recognize from which part you are operating.

Your soul will compel you forward, dear one. You have the gift of this circle of friends to call upon their prayers and you have the gift of the Celestial Angels to support you and you have the blessing of God’s Love in your soul that will continue to grow and expand. You do not need to rush this and just simply take it step by step. For this initial guidance to some degree may feel overwhelming but further guidance will come and God will guide you with what He sees you are ready to do and will open the door in the right timing for your soul, beloved.

So rest assured that your soul’s mission, part of your soul’s mission, is set in this work, for you have love, you have compassion and you have clarity. You understand the teachings of the Church and you understand the workings of Divine Love and these teachings. So, my child, you are a chosen one. Your soul is bright, filled with Love and Light. Honor thyself. Honor the Will of God and all will be well. We are with you.

It has been a pleasure to speak to your group and a delight to have children of the Earth carry the Truth, to witness and see this. God bless you, my friends. I am Pope John Paul. God bless you.
