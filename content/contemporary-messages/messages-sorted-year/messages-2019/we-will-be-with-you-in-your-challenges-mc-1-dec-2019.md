# We Will be with You Through Your Challenges

Received by Maureen Cardoso



I am Gandhi. May I just say that this dear instrument was conversing with me prior to allowing me to speak. She was wondering, what will you say? So she is questioning her and my using her instrumentality and sharing something with you, not that she doubts that I wouldn’t have something to say that would be of importance to touch your hearts and to inspire your continuing on this path of awakening with God’s Love. But it has been a point where she is being asked to stretch in her mediumship in the sense of simply feeling a spirit and allowing that spirit to deliver a messages of love and inspiration. So I thank her for her willingness to go with a blank slate.

Beloved souls, you know the leaders of times past in spirituality, those people who walked the Earth that you read about in your history books and those dear souls who have been leaders in the various faiths that are practiced here on Earth. What I wish to let you know is they too were challenged in their times in trying to bring forward change and to stand for the truth that existed within them and to live this truth even though many others were doubting them or did not believe in them or in some way subscribe to what they felt compelled to exercise in the world and what they felt God was trying to do with their instrumentality. 

As you wonderful souls long to serve God, so you too to some degree, each one, will have time of challenge as these doors continue to open for you and your world is introduced in a very direct and clear way of how to receive the Love of God and connect to God. You also will have challenges and will have souls come before you that do not subscribe and do not believe and they will question. So as one who did his best to serve the people of country in India, I can empathise. Although perhaps, my work was more widespread and I am known around the world. Perhaps that which I faced may be a little bit more challenging than what you have coming to some degree in your future. 

But I am here to encourage each and every one of you to continue to call upon God and your beloved angel friends who understand the challenge of the human condition. We have a different viewpoint watching each of you step forward along your path and know to some degree that which you are headed for. So we are here as a great support for you. Especially when you are in great doubt and may not feel the Presence of us or have a difficult time reaching to God. 

We are very close in these times. So know, my dear friends, as God continues to unfold His great plan and these doors are opened for you that are called to various places and situations, we are with you doing our best to influence the conditions that you will be in and helping those dear souls who will come into Circle and sit with you. We help to influence their ability to feel God’s Love. We work together as you well know.

You are greatly needed. Your work is helping, helping to clear the darkness that is surrounding your world. So together we follow God’s plan in service. Much happens that you do not see and recognise. It is a beautiful work that we engage in together. It is important this time that you are here replenishing, elevating your souls, giving your bodies and minds time to relax in this beautiful atmosphere.

So I hope that you feel my love and my strength, my encouragement for each one of you. It is important to know that you are supported, that you are loved, and that we work together. You are never alone and we continue to serve you. God bless each and every one of you upon at-onement with our Heavenly Father. It is a humble path, a true path, a direct path, and a glorious path.

Continue to serve the awakening of your souls in receiving this beautiful gift of Divine Love. I am Mahatma Gandhi and my love is with each one of you. God bless you.
