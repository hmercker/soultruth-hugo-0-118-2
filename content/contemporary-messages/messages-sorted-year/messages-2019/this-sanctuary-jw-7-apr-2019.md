# This Sanctuary 


April 7<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am Francis and I come to you in God’s love and with great love for all of you here and for this beautiful place. This sanctuary is a place of refuge for many. When I walked the earth with my friends in the hills around Assisi we sang and prayed with so much joy to be in God’s creation. And that is why is was easy for us to open up to God’s love in our own simple way despite our beliefs which were very Catholic. 

Of course we were considered outsiders because we wished to live a simple life in communion with God and God’s creation. And those who have been to the little church that I built with my friends are aware that the presence of God, His love is in that church still, to this day. And it is respected by those who go there. I ask you to bring that same respect to this Sanctuary because this is a holy place and those who come, they come for healing, for refreshment, for the blessing of God’s grace and for our messages. So it is important to keep this place as a Sanctuary, not only this room but all these grounds and the beautiful gardens I am so found of visiting. 

And when there is conflict in this place or disagreement or argument, I ask you to do this with humor and love so that any negative energies are dissipated in the Love. It is a joy to come to this place and visit and all of here commend you for the work you have done and continue to do for the healings that are present here and for the deep desires of all you to reach out to the many in a world that is busy and conflicted as you know. This is a Sanctuary and a place of light in God’s love. How blessed you are. I thank this brother for delivering this message and I am please with the way he has done so. May God bless you all. I love you. I am your brother and friend Francis.

### Notes from Yogananda 

**Paramahansaji**: In the morning we reached Assisi. There we saw St.Clare’s tomb. St.Clare was great devotee of St.Francis. Only after great request, he once broke bread with St.Clare; and while they were sitting together, people saw the Church was afire. When they came, the fire vanished; it was the light of God.

St.Francis met Jesus in the woods almost every night. As I was visiting his living tomb and put my head on the shrine step, St.Francis appeared to me. Then I saw a tunnel of Eternity into which he disappeared. The entire cellar beneath the church was replete with his vibrations. You would have enjoyed very much to meditate here. St.Francis is one of my loved saints with whom I commune and have communed. I write to you these sacred things for God has made you sacred by meditation.

Paramahansa Yogananda in a letter written to Rajarsi Janakananda, from Rajarsi Janakananda: A Great Western Yogi
