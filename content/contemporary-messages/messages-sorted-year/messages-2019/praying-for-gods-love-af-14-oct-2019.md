As you send your prayers up to God with all your intentions and feelings, your desires to bring healing and resolution to the problems and situations that your brothers and sisters find themselves within and for yourselves to be uplifted, may the Father’s Love indeed flow into your souls awakening all those parts that are asleep, that need to be healed, or in need of its chambers being opened to Love. May your prayers be of good faith with the sureness that God is listening and the sureness that God will respond to all that you put forward to Him for this world of yours is so complex, so full of needs, and pain and error and needs your prayers. 

Your prayers could be given every moment in response to the great needs that are all around you. We ask you beloveds to continue to pray for your own souls, to continue to forge that bond and connection between yourselves and God. It is so important to focus upon your own growing soul, to nurture your growing soul in Love. 

Yes there are many to be concerned for. There are many you know are suffering and many that need your support, your love. This is all a part of your efforts to be a channel of love in the world, to reach out in whatever capacity and way that you are able to. Beloved souls, God will attend to your friends and loved ones, to your brothers and sisters. Have great faith that God will attend to these individuals, that your prayers are heard, and that when you offer a prayer to God, let it flutter forth up to God and may you release your concern rather than hold on to your worry and care. 

This is faith, to allow yourselves to let go, to release all that is not in love to God. As you clear yourselves from these conditions and these thoughts, so you are more readily open to the blessings that God has to give to you and your soul. Letting go of all that is not in harmony with His Love and allowing all that God intends to give to you to reach you in all its fullness and power and beauty. With these blessings creating a beautiful light around you, awakening all the desires to be awakened and showing to you the truth of your own soul, the Truth of God’s Soul. 

As God sees you and acknowledges you in His Love, so the light rains down upon you, so the light flows through you and out to the world. So much you can accomplish in these Circles of Light. So much is possible given a condition of faith and trust, of allowing all that is of light and goodness to flow and envelop you in this loving communion with your Creator. 

Release anything that is a burden. Put aside all thoughts that are not of love and focus upon your communion with God. This is what is asked of you as you come together. This is what will bring to you all that is intended. May you be blessed deeply, beloved souls, awakened fully, shown the way to continue to serve God as you have prayed to do and to be His instruments and channels of love. May God bless you, beloved souls. May His Love continue to pour within you. We are with you, we love you. God bless you. I am Keea and I love you. God bless you.
