# Goldie Sprinkles All With Joy and Light

November 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Punalu'u, Oahu, HI, USA

Goldie received by Maureen Cardoso

Ah sooo! My dear friends, I bring, I bring the dust of joy, the air that is filled with a lightness, a lightness to allow any heaviness to bubble up and out and to be received by these extraordinary elements that are in this place where you now sit and pray, this glorious land that God has gifted mankind, the spray of the ocean, the granules of the sand, the kiss of the sun.

I am with all of you and I sprinkle you with great joy, great Light. May I hear you laugh together in your joy, with song and upliftment in your heart. I tickle your behind your ear with love, dear friends, with love. I am Goldie and yes, it has been such a long time since I have been with you and speaking to you.

God bless you, my friends, on your path to joy. I am Goldie and my dust of love and joy is with you. God bless you.
