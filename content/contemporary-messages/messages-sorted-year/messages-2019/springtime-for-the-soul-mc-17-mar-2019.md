Gracious and dear friends, I am Francis, known as St. Francis when on Earth. Yes much is in the air that is blossoming at this time in each of your lives, as you set upon this new season of spring. Many of you have been drawn together in Circles of Light, to pray and to commune and to join in joyful events together.

My dear friends, from this time of your gathering shall be birthed ideas, events, projects, and gatherings. It is a great, great time upon your paths of this Divine Love where many opportunities will be set before each of you - both those who have walked this path for a very long time and those who are new to this path. Much will come to you, these great openings and opportunities, for you to be able to share with others in a very gracious and simple way, your spiritual lives, in the Grace of God’s Love, in the way that fits well for you. For God needs each and every unique soul to speak to those who are before them, in a very comfortable manner and share with others this great journey you are on.

I would like to say that I was with these two souls who sit next to one another as they went about their day today. They discovered and explored a beautiful park where much began to bloom in this park. They found themselves a quiet little area with a bench and they sat upon this bench and were drawn into a silence. Before them on a perch, the birds came. They came to eat of the food that was placed there and they too were drawn. So my two dear friends who are new friends to one another, I walked with you as you joyously shared your stories, your laughter, your love with one another and then continued down, walking along the waters. 

My friends, to be in nature draws you close to God. So as your change of weather happens and warms in most of your areas, you have this great opportunity to be out in the wonderment that God has created in nature. So I encourage you to bring yourself into this air that is fresh, this newness, this crispness, where everything is alive. For there are many elements in this new and fresh air that can help your physical bodies and bring this enlivened experience to you. It is a great time, this time of spring. 

So I come to say, there are many things about to birth in your lives, in each one of your lives. Enjoy them as they rise up and they manifest in your life and use these opportunities and gifts. Have a conscious awareness of the blessings that they are. From your beautiful time in prayer, how you have nurtured your soul and allow your soul to be transformed and changed by the Love of God. Witness with open eyes, the eyes of your soul as things begin to blossom and flower in your life.

It is a pleasure to be with you and to see you all in prayer, drawing close to you the Angels and receiving a deep inflowing of God’s Love into your souls. It is my great joy and privilege to be with you and to share some words, some words that I hope inspire you into the new life that will spring from you. 

God bless you. I am Francis and my love is with you. God bless you.
