# Ask for Us and We Will Come

August 25<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mary received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Mary. I have come to tell you that whenever you feel alone and estranged from God, ask for my presence and I will pray with you and bring comfort to you. For I have deep and tender feelings for each one of you, beloved souls. I wish for my children who are struggling in this Earthly plane to be comforted and in the Light, uplifted, and know that they are loved. I will come and bring my Light and my prayers for your benefit and upliftment. Ask for me and I shall come. Ask for God and God will be there. Together we will bask in the Light of God and know His deep blessings within our souls.

God bless you beloveds. I am Mary and I love you all. God bless you.
