Goldie received by Maureen Cardoso

My sweet, sweet friends, we shall have a joyous time together. I am so happy to see the smiles upon your face and the light in your eyes. It shall be a glorious time together splashing in the waters and smelling the fragrant flowers. You will see. It will be joy and joy is what lives within each and every one of you. I will be with you all. God bless you, my beautiful friends. God bless you.

I am Goldie. I have been waiting for this time to be together with you in such a way. God bless you, my dear, dear friends. I love you and I am Goldie.
