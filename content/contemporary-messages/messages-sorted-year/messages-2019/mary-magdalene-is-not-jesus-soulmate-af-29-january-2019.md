# Mary Magdalene is not Jesus’ Soulmate

January 29<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons. Canada

Received by A.F.

God bless you, I am Mary Magdalene. I have come to confirm [the message that has been received recently regarding my relationship with the Master.](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2019/jesus-incarnated-with-a-complete-soul-af-27-january-2019/) My love for him is great. My respect and acknowledgement of his beautiful soul, this beautiful man who brought the Truth of God’s Love to mankind. I was close to Jesus during his time and his ministry upon the world. He changed my life by his message and by directing my gaze towards God. For this I am ever grateful for his efforts and his blessings of his attentions upon me to teach me this truth. But I was never his soulmate, merely a follower, one who indeed who was close at times, one who ministered to his needs as he journeyed upon the Earth. In my own way I gave to this beautiful man whose soul was bright and luminous in Love and Truth, but I was never his wife nor his lover nor anything but one who loved in innocence and gratitude, he who taught Truth and brought salvation to mankind in his message of Love. 

May God bless you, beloved souls. I hope that I have come to dispel some myths and untruths of my character and role with the beloved Master. I continue to follow his teachings and am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. My soul is bright with the Father’s Love and I have great joy and fulfillment in this. In each one of you I see that you are bright in Love and will someday join us in this exalted heaven. May God bless you upon that journey and bring your many gifts and blessings of the soul. I thank you for listening and may God bless you, my friends, beautiful souls all. I am Mary Magdalene and my love is with you all. God bless you.
