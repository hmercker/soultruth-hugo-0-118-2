I am Seretta Kem. I reside in the Celestial Kingdom and am one of the many teachers that come and join these Circles of Light and share the teachings of Divine Love and support the souls who walk this path, praying for the love of God to inflow into their souls and transform their souls.

It is good to hear you share those practices that you involve in your life that help to support you and ground you and bring a sense of peace to your day. They are important in your spiritual well-being, keeping your mind as calm as you possibly can, in relieving the stress, and allowing your thoughts to be towards spiritual things over your material. When you set your mind upon spiritual things and most importantly towards God and focus upon your souls, this is the greatest thing that you can do to support your spiritual growth. It requires commitment. Each of you are well versed in what commitment is in other areas of your life. You commit to your physical well-being, to the nurturance and well-being of your family and loved ones, to friendships and relationships. You commit to your daily jobs that each of you go to. There is much that you commit to. 

What I would like to bring to your attention is to develop this commitment towards the awakening of your soul, this part that is deep within you, the part that is the true you. Upon the Divine Love path, it is when one commits to a life of prayer, prayer where you open. You open on the level of soul. You open your heart to your beloved Creator. You become like a child and you give yourself and all your vulnerability to the Grace of God and long and ask for the great Gift of Divine Love, God’s very Essence to come into your soul. 

As you receive this Love, this great Inflowing, these Living Waters will wash away all that is not harmonious within your life. Great peace comes. There comes a sense of knowing yourself and a sense of feeling grounded within your physical form. Over time, the mind settles as well and the mind will begin to recognize the existence of your soul. Through your consciousness there will come a great harmony within you. There will be a communion between your soul and mind, where your mind has the ability to serve your soul and the desire to serve your soul. For your soul is deeply connected to God and when your mind is serving your soul it is also serving the Will of God for you. 

At this present time, most of you live in duality. Mind is directing you in one way. For those who have an awareness of their soul, soul is trying to lead in a harmonious way, often in alignment with the Will of God. Until this duality becomes a unity, you will experience this struggle. But, my beloveds, with your deep commitment you will be able to observe the awakening of your soul, the strengthening of this deep part within you coming alive and the desire of your soul will override that of the mind. You will find yourself in great alignment and harmony in your life. You will walk with every step hand in hand with your beloved Creator. You will be led into many areas of your life that you could not even think about at this point in time. 

The journey of a soul awakening in Divine Love does require your commitment to this prayer and taking time to sit with God, whether that be in circle as you are now or on your own. It does not require a formal setting. It just requires a simple acknowledgment from that place deep within you to be with God. For it is your soul that yearns, longs, and desires to be with God. You have been created in such a way. 

So I thank you for allowing me to come and share my words of encouragement. I hope to inspire you to commit to the awakening of your soul, to commit to receiving this great Essence of God’s Love within your soul, and allow yourself to be changed in numerous ways, ways that will bring great peace, joy and many blessings. For all great Gifts come from God, beloveds. 

I am Seretta Kem and my love is with you. God bless you.
