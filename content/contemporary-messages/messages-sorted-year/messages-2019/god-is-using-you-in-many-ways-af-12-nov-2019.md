Your friend Confucius is here, hearing your pleas for healing and upliftment. God sends His angels, does He not, to assist you when you are in need of healing and upliftment? So, we are here. So, we are here, many healers, many with great gifts. In this blessing of healing, so we strengthen your own gift of healing, beloved souls. Each of you in your own way, has a touch for those who are in need of healing blessings. 

So we work with each one of you and through each one of you. For many in the world, many who you do not even know but at this moment are praying for the touch of healing for them. You see the great power of the Circle, of earnest souls gathered together in this Light, God may use you in many ways. You are each like a great rainbow of blessings magnified through you, this great prism of your soul sending forth these blessings, sending forth a touch of comfort here, a relief of pain there, some love, upliftment, joy, mending of bones and healing of hearts. 

Many ways can you be used in this world, this world that continues to run asunder in flame and wind, in the quaking of Earth, waters rising and waters diminishing. So much in your Earth is need of balance and healing. I know, beloved souls, you cannot carry the burden of saving the world. God does not intend for you to feel this immense responsibility. But as you walk in faith, as you continue to pray, as you continue to reach forth to the Source of All, so you become a powerful channel. In your innocence and your ignorance of what you accomplish, you become a clear channel. For your intentions and ideas as to what is required do not interfere with Godâ€™s Will and His Great Wisdom that will direct these blessings forth in the world. 

So we work together, beloved souls. So we work together in our efforts to heal the world. So much can be accomplished by simple prayer and simple desire to be a channel of Love. Remember, it is your intention and your desire to be used as an instrument for God, in releasing your mindful intentions in this regard that you open the floodgates. They pour immense Light, immense Light pours out into the world through each of you. Together you become a great Pillar of Light, a great beacon, drawing many in the spirit planes to you in curiosity and desire to warm themselves by this Flame of Light that God has poured into this place, into your midst and expanded it and expanded it into the world. 

So much can be accomplished, beloved souls, through your tiny efforts. Though you see yourselves as miniscule in the great sea of humanity, it is the diamond that sparkles in the darkness. It is the immense power of faith and love that brings the great waves of Light into the darkness. You are together in this unity and singleness of purpose, beloved souls. Know this. Know that God continues to bring you together for a purpose, for healing and for Love. 
God bless you, beloved souls. I bring you the healing and Grace of God as one of His humble servants in the universe of Love. God bless you. I am Confucius and I love you. Your song will be pure, your Light, beautiful to behold. God bless you.
