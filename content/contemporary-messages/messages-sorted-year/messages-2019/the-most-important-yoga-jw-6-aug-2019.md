I am here in God’s grace, Yogananda. I am often with my brother Francis (as I am today) and I wish to speak to you about the soul. The yoga of Divine Love incorporates the entire being. When the soul informs the mind, it is not necessary to have the organ of discrimination (the mind) in the forefront of choice because one is in the Love of God.

Yes, of course it is important to take care of your bodies. These are your vehicles as humans. If you make healthy choices, exercise and practice yoga, that is good. But the most important yoga is to be open to this Love. When I taught the Kriya yoga, I was attempting to make a bridge between the East and the West, between the materialism of the West and the attachment to the body and the Eastern path of abstinence and connecting to the soul. I used this physical body as a vehicle. But as I said then to my disciples, my students, if you really want to succeed at this Kriya yoga, think about God all the time. Let this be the first thing in your day, the first thought of your day. Whatever you do during the day, give it to God.

As I said in my last message through this one, make the world your ashram, your monastery, your church by being mindful of God in whatever you do. This is the yoga of God’s Love. This is what I wish to convey now from the Celestial Heavens. This is soul to soul.

I encourage you all, to make this first and foremost in your lives and remember as Master Jesus said: *“Seek thee first the Kingdom of Heaven and all else will be given to you.”* How true this is. Keep this in your hearts. Allow your souls the gift of receiving God’s Love in whatever you are doing. In this way, you will be a blessing to all, wherever you are, whatever you do, whomever you may be with. Words are not necessary whenever you are in communion with the Heavenly Father. Let His Light and Love shine through your soul.  I say to you, be a gift, be a gift to all, be a gift to each other as you are in this moment. As God gives you the gift of Love, God’s Love in your soul, may this be your gift to God and the world.

We are with you on this journey. Yes, there is much light in this place. What a blessing. We shall stay a while longer with you today and we will be with you later in prayer with your friends. We love you. May God bless you. I am Yogananda. I love you. God loves you.
