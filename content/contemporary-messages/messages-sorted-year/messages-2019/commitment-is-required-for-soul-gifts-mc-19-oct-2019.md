We wish to extend our thanks and gratitude to each one of you who has gathered over these weeks when you've come together with an interest in Divine Love mediumship. For it is in your world that indeed we do hope to use and develop more mediums for as there is great change upon your world, there will be a great need and comfort for many to know of this is Love, to know of the comfort of God, to know that God has not left them. 

We, your angel friends, desire to use these mediums for words of love and comfort encouragement and how to move forward through these great many changes. As the dear soul who has been in such great service with his extraordinary gift of mediumship indicated to you, that it is not overnight that any individual can be developed in order for us, your celestial friends, to come close enough and have a soul rapport. No dear ones, it is a time of development that will require the commitment of the individual. First and foremost, their commitment in prayer is needed. Their longing for their soul to be cleaned, cleanse, awakened, healed, released and opened to a certain degree through Divine Love is needed. 

Without this factor it is not possible for us to be able to maintain a rapport with the individual. So your dedication to praying for Divine Love for God to touch your soul is the primary factor in having your gift of mediumship developed for service of spreading the teachings and Truths of Divine Love to others. It is one where God and your angel friends observe you closely, dear friends, for you are never alone. It is one thing to be in such a way before others, how you appear and show yourself in public. But also remember we observe you when you are on your own. It is an important part of your commitment showing to God your truth, your integrity and your honesty to be of service. For this style is mediumship is not for show. It is not about receiving the accolades and glory of others. It is about you seriously being true within you, healing you and being honest and clear with God.
 
It does take a great commitment from our side of life to help to develop these gifts of the soul. Yes some of you have felt us working upon you. We do dedicate greatly to the awakening of you in the development of your gifts. Isn't it a beautiful thing coming together with the curiosity of Divine Love mediumship. Being a medium, the idea of it, can be a draw to many. But as the dear sister shared, what she mostly received from this time of coming together was a healing upon her soul from the gift of Love from God flowing within. That is the key. No matter what gifts you carry, beloveds, walking the Path of Divine Love, each of you are equal in the opportunity to obtain the Gift of Divine Love. 

When you do such, all other gifts that have been implanted within you, strengthen, if they are already being used. For those seeds that have been placed within you that maybe have not yet rooted or begun to grow, shall do so by the Grace of this Love. Godâ€™s Design is complete. There is not one aspect in your life that the Grace of Divine Love cannot rectify, correct, heal and bring into harmony. It is our hope that you will once again gather in such a way and continue to come together and grow, grow in your spiritual walk, and connect deeply as family for each of you in your souls recognize one another as family. It has been a great pleasure to work with each of you, and we shall continue to do so. Always pray for Divine Love and all shall be well. I am your teacher Seretta Kem. My love is with you. God bless you.
