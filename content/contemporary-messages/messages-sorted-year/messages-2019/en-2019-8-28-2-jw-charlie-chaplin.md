Charlie Chaplin received by Jimbeau Walsh

Ho ho ho, a little ho ho. Ah you know me. I got this one in stitches this morning, yeah. He recorded a song the other day for children. The adults there could not, they could not get this. It seemed trite to them. And yet it was a delight. The child in me was there with him in this recording, so much enjoying it. So I come to once again encourage you to bring humour and music into your prayers, into your meetings, so necessary for every soul.

As I progress, I see the need for this on Earth, for positive, humorous, prayerful, joyful music, film, for those who are creative in your circle like this one I speak through today. You have many angels supporting your work. Move forward. Do not be afraid to ask for whatever means will bring the end results in your projects, because behind all your projects I can see the love, the intention, the wish for us all to be blessed, to be transformed in our loving Father’s Grace.

So the other day, this one, he heard the singing of “The Sunny Side of the Street”. He thought that, well, this must be Charles, but it was in fact his brother Yogananda, and me too. We were all singing. Life is so complete on the sunny side of the street. So keep your sunny sides up. I don't wish to say a lot more today, but I bring you my smile, my joy, my gratitude, and I'm so grateful to having this privilege to speak.

My love to all. May God bless you. I am Charles.
