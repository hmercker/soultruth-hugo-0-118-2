Matthew received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, beloved children of God. I am Matthew. I am indeed a resident of the Celestial Kingdom, the Heaven of which our beloved brother Jesus talks of. The breath of God is upon you, beloveds. God knows each and every one of you here. God knows you better than you know yourselves. God desires that you know Him, that you know Him well, that you come to know His Love for you. For Godâ€™s Love for every soul in Creation is great, beyond your comprehension my beloved friends and beyond your understanding and knowing of Love.

For the power of that Love can transform your soul in complete and wondrous ways, making you a fit inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. For this is how all of us who dwell within this wondrous and exalted place have come to be there. We have followed the instructions of the Master Jesus to seek God with all our hearts and all our souls, to seek the Blessing of Love, the power of the Essence of God to infill and bless us and change us. This is the greatest gift that God can give. This is the gift that will continue to awaken you for all eternity. For when this gift is bestowed upon a soul, it does not leave, it is not lost.

As you continue to ask for this gift, it will grow and accumulate within you and bring you to that place of at-onement with God. The joy that you will feel, the awakenings that will come, the gifts that will spread before you and manifest through you will be immense. It is the key that opens the door to many, many spiritual understandings and experiences. God is waiting to bless each one of you. Seek this gift of His Love and you will know of those things of which I speak. You will come to know the Love of God resting within your souls and the joy and awakenings that will come with this blessing.

God bless you. I am Matthew and I am pleased to be with you in this beautiful living sanctuary of light. God bless you. God bless you.
