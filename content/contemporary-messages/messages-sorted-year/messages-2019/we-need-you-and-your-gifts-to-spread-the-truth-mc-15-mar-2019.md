I pray with you. It is Yogananda. I have not spoken through this instrument before but I’m very happy to make a rapport with this instrument and bring forward a continued message of support for the dear soul who I will work together with in bringing writings and teachings of truth as I have already shared my desire to do so through him. (Jimbeau)

Beloved souls, as you pray now together two oceans apart and your world is can seem a vast distance but isn’t it lovely how the soul transcends time and space and how easily you can feel the loving presence of one another and the closeness, the bonds that are there by the Grace of God. This is what the Love of God does upon souls. It unites them. It bonds them and creates a knowing of one’s soul to the other, deeper than anyone can experience through the mind. Relationships through the mind is limited. Relationships through the soul has absolutely no limitation.

Beloveds, it is wonderful to witness the two of you and the others in the awareness of their gifts opening in ways that these gifts will serve to further the teachings of truths in your world. Each soul has a unique blend and a unique way for us in spirit to be able to make a rapport and share further teachings. Each of these ways is very important for the many avenues allow for us to reach a broader audience. For it is not only through the ways of Christianity that we wish to touch others and the teachings that Jesus taught while walking upon Earth. But those of us who carry teachings that were somewhat different when we walked upon Earth, we too wish to come and reach and teach those who follow our ways still, wishing to further and share our understanding now that we have transitioned into spirit and continued with the progression of our souls, understanding the Divine Love. 

As you, dear souls, pray to receive the gift of Divine Love in your soul and the workings of this Love upon your soul brings harmony, opens gifts, so this allows and opens an avenue for us in spirit to bring our further messages and our teachings. We need you. We need brave and courageous souls with these gifts in order to help those upon Earth in furthering these teachings and understandings. 

So when we on the side of spirit, your celestial friends, see a potential avenue, it draws us very close. We become very interested in helping and influencing and invest our efforts in the progression of your souls. It draws us near.

Continue to pray. Continue to long to know God and the understandings and the workings of your souls and the faculties, the many gifts that lie within you for your time on Earth is very precious. Your efforts for furthering the truths, if you do not necessarily recognize their great potentials at this time and moment, I can guarantee you when you transition to the side of spirit and there is a review of your Earth life, it will please you greatly every ounce of this Love that you have received, every effort that you have made when speaking to another about these truths, when praying to God to receive truths, in sharing these truths freely in love, kindness and with compassion to others. 

I recognize this gift of being able to take dictation from me for this dear soul, (J) as it is new and we are at the beginning, may feel somewhat daunting. But I wish to reassure you, my dear friend, should you allow this and should you relax into it and be gentle with your progression, understanding that it will take some time to develop and you will be well pleased with what we can do together. 

The uniqueness and the approach that those of us who taught, who were of the Eastern philosophies when on Earth, need souls such as yourself who understand to some degree these teachings and thus you have the ability within your minds, the understanding of what is the mindset of these philosophies and teachings these beliefs. We can use you in these different circles. So I am here as I speak through this instrument to encourage both of you upon your paths to open yourselves. Open your minds. Open your souls to the potential ways God will use you both. 

As you travel around your world, you will find yourself before souls who have unique understanding and perspectives. We will be able to inspire you, influence you, bring teachings through you and understandings through you. Remember, there are many, many, many paths to God, each person with their own unique destiny. Any soul who is willing to plant a seed of truth into another soul is fulfilling a purpose. It will not be a grand and overt expression in every single experience with another soul. No, my friends, if you could only see the subtle ways that these seeds are implanted throughout your day as you come before others and share, it would put a smile upon your face realizing the many ways God touches others through you. 

It is a great blessing to be with you. It is a great blessing to watch those who yearn for the Love of God to bless their souls and come together in prayer, igniting a greater power. For when you pray with another, the power is greater as well and the bond deepens and the potentials of workings and workings of furthering the truths can be realized.

Beloved souls, you are greatly blessed. I touch you both with my love, with my encouragement for all of those who seek for the Love of God in their souls. May you be deeply blessed upon your journeys and may you continue to yearn for the Love of your Creator to bless you greatly. Walk with your eyes open allowing the glory of love to flow from you. For my dear friends, you have an abundance of this Love stored within your souls awaiting to be showered upon others. Give your souls the opportunity to flow and to touch all those in your midst. Awaken in your souls, my dear friends, and walk by the Grace of God.

I am Yogananda and my love is with you. God bless you.
