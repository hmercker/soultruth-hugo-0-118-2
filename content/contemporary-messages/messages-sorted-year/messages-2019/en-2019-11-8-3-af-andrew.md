Andrew received by Al Fike

You embark on quite a journey together, beloved friends. The souls are already gathering in this place. They see the Light. They sense that something important is about to happen. You will find that many thousands will come, that your humble little home will host a great gathering, one that will affect the souls of many on my side of life. The angels are poised to use this opportunity to speak the Truth and demonstrate the Truth to those souls in the lower spheres and the grey spheres, even in those spheres of light who wish to learn more.

You see, my friends, you inhabit a very fortunate place in the ordered universe, where we may come and speak, to be heard by many, and seen. You see, your service is not of one dimension only, or one plane, but many. Your efforts are important indeed. May you all prepare yourselves. Sleep well tonight. Think of spiritual thoughts and soulful desires for God.

When you awaken in the morning, there will be a sense of excitement and purpose, joy. In the morrow, much will come, much will be experienced, much will manifest in the Light of Godâ€™s Touch. You are all beautiful souls. As you come together in this way, so you create such a wonderful light and God will utilize the lights of your soul to bring forth many blessings on your Earth plane.

God bless you, beloved souls. I will be with you. I am Andrew. My love is with you. We are joyed that you come together and seek to serve in this way and we will take advantage of this opportunity to the fullest measure. May God bless you, bless you deeply, beloved souls. Andrew loves you.
