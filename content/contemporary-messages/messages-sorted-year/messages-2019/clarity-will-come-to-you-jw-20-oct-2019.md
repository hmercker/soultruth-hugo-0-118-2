# Clarity Will Come to You

October 20<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


I am here your sister and friend in Divine Love, Eileen Caddy. I don’t wish to disturb this beautiful prayer, but to confirm what our brother Yogananda and our brother Luke, Andrew, all these wonderful souls, these Celestials, have said. When I heard the voice of God speaking to me, it was indeed a small, still voice, but very clear. This clarity will come to all of you in prayer. As long as you send up the intention, as Luke said, the Soul of God will respond. 

There are many here with you this day. We are so happy to see you all. If you could see all that are here, it would even lift your hearts even higher. So I wish to add my blessing and my love. For all of us who are with you in this Light, in this awakening, may God’s Love open up each soul, awaken you, transform you, bring this joy to your heart, this glory to your souls. I love you. I am Eileen.
