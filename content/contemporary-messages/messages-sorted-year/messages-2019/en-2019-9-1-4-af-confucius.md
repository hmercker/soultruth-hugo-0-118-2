Confucius received by Al Fike

I am Confucius. You have had much to contemplate over these days together. We have chosen this time in prayer to give healing and peace, blessings to you all. We are happy with what you have come to see and do together, to be in the flow and peace and Touch of God’s Love, utilising the conditions, the blessings, the energies, the words, the yearnings of your souls, that which has come to each of you. We wish you deep peace, beloved souls, deep peace, to bathe in this Light, soothe your bodies, the Touch of God’s Peace upon your souls and your minds. Blessings to you, beloveds, blessings of peace. Confucius loves you… blessings.
