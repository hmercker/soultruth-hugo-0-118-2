# Thank you for your effort in prayer

January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Angels' Q&A Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Matthew received by Al Fike

I’ve come to thank you for your efforts in prayer, for all those who participated in this time together to receive messages of healing and love and truth. There will always be more to speak of, to teach about, to give in the way of answering the questions of the mind, but remember, beloved souls, the answers lie within you. The answers are there as you continue to awaken your souls and come to that place of conscious awakening, then truly many Truths will be available to you as you go to God, as you come to your own soul to commune with God.

Within this gift of Love comes Truth. Within your souls there is a great repository of Truth that given time and the continued alignment of your soul and your mind, these things will come to the fore of your consciousness and you will know the answers to all the questions. You already know the answers to many and if you have forgotten, there are many transcripts to be read and messages of the past to be shared, so that you may refresh your memories and refresh your souls with the upliftment of Love and Truth, both within your minds and your souls.

We will call upon you at other times to share in these prayers, in this pursuit of Truth. As you continue to progress in God’s Love, so the questions will change, the perceptions will deepen, the Love will grow and glow within you. In this way, more may come, greater Truths, higher Truths. When you are ready these things will come. We will gather together again and speak and share, reaching for the highest, seeking the benefits of the soul awakened and sharing the great cornucopia of Truth that God has for humanity.

So much awaits you, beloved souls. The pursuit of Truth never ends as does the great awakening of your soul as it is redeemed in Love and transformed. I wish to thank you all for your efforts, your time, for making this time to be together, sharing in prayer and love, supporting one another as the Grace of God continues to flow and bring you close.

So I say, God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you in His Love and enliven your souls in Love, uplifting, embracing, healing and teaching. God bless you. This is Matthew and I continue to be close. The angels are with you and will carry you forward upon your journeys. Those who are here in the flesh, those who are connected to this Circle of Light, those who are eager and have a deep desire for Truth will be touched by God and come close. You all will come close, in circles upon Circles of Light, Truth and Love. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with you always. God bless you.
