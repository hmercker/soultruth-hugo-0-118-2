Andrew received by Al Fike

Bless you, precious and beloved souls, it is Andrew. May God continue to uplift you and His Love pour into you as you come to know who you truly are and who God truly is on this journey of awakening, of knowing the Truth. For God wants to feed you much in the way of Truth, beloved souls. God has a banquet laid before you and is anxious for you to partake of all the wonderments and blessings and knowledge and joy and Truth and Love that is available to each and every soul. For you are all children of God. You are all deeply loved by God and you are all invited to the banquet of Love and understanding.

Beloved souls, may you truly be blessed and fulfilled in this Love and God’s Touch upon you. For God will indeed lead you to the table. He will place before you many blessings and fruits of your labours as you continue to strive for Truth and strive to be opened to God’s blessings, awakened by God’s Love, so that your vision is clearer and you are able to take within you all that God has to give and all the many blessings that are available.

There is so much that awaits you, beloved souls. So much that can indeed awaken and open your eyes, your senses, the capacities of your soul, to truly be a part of life; the life that God intends for each child. The fulfillment of the desires of the soul, even that which is of the mind is fed by Love and Truth. My beloved friends, walk in God’s Light. Seek the blessings that God so desires to give you. Allow yourselves the indulgence of your soul by feasting on this great bounty of Love. In this way you will find great pleasure and joy and fulfillment. 

My beloved friends, you continue to seek the truth and walk in the great blessings of God and we are all together in this Light. We continue to pray together, not only for yourselves but for this world, so that the blessings of God’s gifts upon this world may be realized and acknowledged and taken within. Continue to pray for this world, beloved souls. Continue to pray for the awakening of your souls, as God’s Love infiltrates all the chambers and places within you that are in need of this Sustenance, this Blessing, these Living Waters, the Bounty of God’s Soul given to your soul.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Andrew and I love you dearly. God bless you, beautiful souls. God bless you.
