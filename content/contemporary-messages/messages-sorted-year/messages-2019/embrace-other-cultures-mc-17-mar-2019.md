# Embrace other Cultures

My name is Guru Ram Das and I join you in this hour of prayer. When upon Earth, I was the fourth Guru, the fourth teacher in the Sikh tradition. I reside in the Celestial Heavens and I too seek with my soul for the great blessing of Divine Love. For my teachers before me introduced this Love to me and we too joined the Celestial Divine Path. 

Some of you on Earth will have the opportunity and the purpose and mission to embrace other cultures, those that carry the teachings of these Eastern Religions. This instrument who I speak through has such a mission. We in the Celestial Heavens of the Sikh faith, observe her very closely, for she has this ability to draw Truth and feel from her soul Truths in this tradition in the way that she has been introduced to this faith. This dear soul speaks from her heart when she shares her understandings. 

When the Love of God resides in a soul, my dear friends, it transcends, it transcends religion. She was unexpectedly given the opportunity, along with her dear friend, to attend an event where the majority in attendance were of the East Indian culture, whether it be Hindu or Sikh. These two souls graciously embraced the song and the dance and the opportunity to share with the Love that is in their hearts. This dear soul was impressed to sing what is known as a Sikh prayer. She knows this prayer through her teachings of yoga that she shares and practices. This simple prayer sung so beautifully together with a beautiful artist touched the hearts of those there. 

When one simply lives by the Grace of their soul and the Love that is in their soul and listens to the promptings of their soul, even though there may be doubt in their mind, many are touched. She witnessed how these souls fell into the Grace of what was being shared and felt the elation of Love and expressed how this touched their hearts and how they felt it in their hearts. 

So I come to encourage you. Should you find yourself before others here upon Earth who celebrate God in unique ways to you, to be open and to see their Light. Look past their skin. Look past their clothing. Look past their material being and see the Light of who they are. For this, beloved friends, is how God sees them, the Light that they are. 

It is wonderful to witness when you beautiful souls have so much Love in your souls and you express it through your hearts and you allow the workings of God to move through you and your purpose and your mission opens. It is a beautiful thing for us to witness, high up in the Heavens, to watch others embrace their purpose and allow the changes and the unfoldings in their life, to move past the blocks that their mind may be in a deep rhythm with and they simply allow the Grace of God to work through them. This is what you are all moving to. Each unique soul has their path. Look past the material, my dear friends. Do not be inhibited by the words of another. Simply embrace the Light that they are. Allow your Light to see their Light. Allow your Light to embrace the Light of another. 

When time comes for you to transition into our side of Light, my friends, you will be extraordinarily pleased with your deep, soulful and truthful efforts. I embrace you deeply and we too are with you. There are many in the Celestial Heavens from different traditions that they practiced upon Earth. For the Light and the Love that God has blessed us with, sees the unity of mankind. I thank you. I thank you for hearing from me. I thank this instrument for honoring her path. 

I am Guru Ram Das, one of your Celestial Angels that love you and guide you. Sat nam.

**Note:** Guru Ram Das was the fourth of the ten Gurus of Sikhism. He was born on 24 September 1534 in a family based in Lahore, India.
