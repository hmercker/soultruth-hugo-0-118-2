Confucius received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Confucius. I come to bring a blessing for you all for the coming year, a blessing of peace and upliftment. No matter where you are in the world and those who are connected to this Circle of Light, a blessing of peace and light to you all.

Godâ€™s Hand is upon you. His mighty Hand protects you and guides you and His Holy Spirit continues to bring the inflowing of His Essence within you, changing, formulating a new soul, bright and filled with joy and gifts Divine. You will continue to awaken, my beloved friends. You will continue to serve God in whatever capacity is available to you in your life. God will continue to inspire you beyond the mediocre of the daily existence of humanity, to ways and means that will bring great joy to you and great service to others. Doors indeed are being opened, beloved souls. Long for this and know that God shall carry you forward into greater Light, deeper Truth, and more wondrous service in Love and Light. You are His children and you shall be carried and guided and blessed.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Confucius and I bring you my love. God bless you. God bless you.
