# What Do You Want to Build?

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

I am here Eileen Caddy. I am the spiritual founder of the community at Findhorn. I was at a crossroads in my life and I needed to make choices, but I didn’t know how. So I prayed with all of my heart and all my soul for guidance. Oh and indeed I got it, every day.<sup>1</sup> From that small still voice speaking to me from on high was built an entire community which has expanded and grown over the years. Though the focus there has shifted somewhat from spiritual guidance to ecology, it is still a wonderful place and it was built on guidance from God and the angels. 

So I would ask you all to consider, what do you want to build? What do you want to leave? What do you want to do? You have a community and you have separate existences so to speak, but you come together as one in prayer, in song, in sharing of food, ideas, travels and many things. There is so much desire here to feel love, to share love, to serve. What a wonderful thing it is. 

We had this at Findhorn. People came from far and wide with all kinds of gifts and contributed, because they wanted to serve. They wanted to build something greater than themselves. It was often a very humbling experience. We had elements to deal with in that northern region where the community is. Yet we had the warmth of love and community and prayer and guidance. Those of you who know my work, know I was guided every day. I thought at first: *“This is too much for me. How can I do this?”* But I began to realize with every guidance that actually it was much less work to be in the flow and to follow the guidance than to try and figure it out with my mind. So more and more I was in my soul and that guidance was supreme and resulted in such beautiful things. So yes, we had physical world to deal with. We built physical things, but we did them with spiritual guidance, so our souls were blessed as we created a physical community, a garden. We had much music and still do. So I offer this to all of you as a template. You have built a wonderful community and you can do more if it is your wish. You are one in God’s Love. We are all one. You have such great angelic support from on high, so many angels. We support you. So choose what you will and know you are not alone. You are with each other and with God and all of the Celestial angels at your beck and call. 

Thank you for allowing me to come and share with you. I am delighted to be in this Portal of Light<sup>2</sup> with so many wonderful souls. Thank you. May God bless you all. My love and blessings to all. I am your sister and friend in God’s Love, Eileen Caddy. God bless you.

**Note 1** Her autobiography *“Flight into Freedom”* is a fabulous explanation of both her journey and her guidance, amazing as it frequently was. I (GC) would recommend this book to any serious seeker.

**Note 2** There was a portal of light at Findhorn, and it still exists there today.
