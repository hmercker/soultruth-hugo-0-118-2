Andrew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Andrew. The Touch of God is upon you all. He embraces you all in His Love and carries you upward into conditions that are beyond the Earthly realms to places of Light, encouraging your souls to open and receive the benediction of His Love. So, God uplifts and God blesses and brings you into greater harmony and Light.

God encourages you to create Light in your abodes, wherever you may be, and within your own souls, so that you may be a channel of Light in the world, that you may have wherever you live, a place that is your sanctuary of Light. Gather Godâ€™s Blessings around you as you long for this within you, so you bring the angels of Light, the Celestial angels of God into your midst, uplifting and enlightening, bringing truth and joy.

Each of you has been claimed by God. Each of you will continue upon this journey to at-onement with God. Know that you are claimed. Know that you are loved. Know that this journey just begins and that you will find your way to greater Light, to greater understanding, and to greater love. As you walk in this world, so your sense of love, of loving yourself and loving all around you, will grow. You and God will discover the wonderment and the power and the glory that is Love.

Open your hearts to God. In this, God will show you how to open your heart to all in your world. In this way, you fulfill His great desire for the upliftment, the healing, the transformation of all souls in your world. Be that beautiful channel of love. Be that beautiful child of God. Be in the Light and know that you are loved.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Andrew and I walk with you upon this journey that never ends. God bless you. God bless you.
