# Blessed Are the Children of Light

August 4<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Blessed are the children of Light who heed the call of God’s Love, who carry the lantern of God’s Truth, who seek to know their own souls and to improve and awaken their souls through Love. Blessed are the children who seek God above all else and walk in the Light of God’s Presence in this world. You are blessed, beloveds. You are blessed beyond measure. The Light of His Love continues to envelop you and flow within you.

May you continue upon this journey of Light, awakening to all Truth, all goodness, all Love. As you are indeed embraced by God, awakened by God, and will continue to walk upon this Path of Love. The Path which I lead, beloveds, of which I continue to show you the way. I will be with you always upon that glorious Path of Light. I will be with you always. My love is with you always, beloveds. I am with you always.

I am Jesus. And I bless you beloved souls who continue to yearn for this gift, who continue to put aside the material concerns so that you may be in the Grace of God. May God continue to bless you. May God continue to rest His Hand upon your souls and carry you beyond the conditions of this world to that place of light and joy and love. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you and I love you.
