Received by Maureen Cardoso



I am with you, beloved souls, it is Mary. Oh my children, when the heart yearns and when the soul seeks, there but is God, awaiting to shower you with the blessing of His Living Waters, awaiting to bless you with the kiss of Love, awaiting for your call, awaiting for your recognition that His Love is but a breath away, that this Love is but a moment away at all times. For a seeking soul who desires to know God, who calls forth this Love and as this Love enters the soul and washes and cleanses and brings all into harmony, that soul has but the ability to live in harmony. 

My children, continue to seek and yearn, long and breathe in this great Love, this blessing, available in any moment. Allow these living waters to shower you with Love, with joy, peace and harmony, and all will come into balance. Awaken your souls, my beloved children. Awaken your souls to the presence of Love, to these attributes of God, to the workings of God in your life, to the rhythm and the dance that God desires to take you upon through His Love. 

Those who know His Love are deeply blessed. Those who know this Love are asked to step forward, to share, to share the message of Love and to share the way in which God’s Love is but a breath away. One only needs to open their heart and their soul to the inflowing. Those who know this Love, we ask that you bless another with this knowledge using words of kindness, in acceptance, in an openness. Always be gentle, my loves, always be gentle. As you come close to God, these words will be given to you to speak, for the wisdom that is infilled in your soul will desire an expression and knows the way to reach another. 

Your expanding souls, filled with wisdom and Truth will be able to gift others the understanding, the true understanding of God’s Love. For God is Love my children, God is Love. My love is with you as you pray and as you receive a great and mighty inflowing. There are many Angels with you at this time, filling this room and walking with you.

All souls are blessed with the great gift of free will and their highest desire is the desire of God’s Love. Make that a part of your day each day, receiving this great blessing of Love. God bless you my children. I am Mary. My love is with you all, blessed souls, children of God, seekers of Truth. God bless you.
