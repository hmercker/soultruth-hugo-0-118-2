Each of you has an angel present with you and each of you has been connected with a cord of light woven in this beautiful net that covers the world. Beloved souls, God’s Hand is upon each one of you whether you have just begun to pray for His Love or whether you have been praying for this gift for many years. 

There is a bond created with your brothers and sisters that brings you together in unity and love. God is busy weaving His children into this beautiful tapestry of love, bringing you into that beautiful condition and connection that uplifts and supports you all. You are a part of the family that is bringing light into this world. Your prayers have impact and bring blessings to many. 

Your efforts to reach for the highest, to be touched by the angels and to have God open your souls and awaken your souls, these things are of the utmost importance in your world at this time. For God is engaged in an effort to uplift humanity and to change the conditions of your world so that all are in the light, and you, each one of you, however humble, however new you are to this reality, may find your place and be engaged in this great effort to heal this world and bring peace and harmony.

It starts with your souls, beloveds, the opening of your souls to this great gift. In this, many blessings come and much that is within you will emerge and blossom in your life as God continues to awaken you and ignite the beautiful gifts of your soul. 

Continue in your prayers, beloveds. Continue to reach out to one another and to realize that you are all part of one family, the family of God’s children. In this, may you know a great joy, a great comfort, and a great collaboration to bring ever greater truth to this world and greater light to humanity. Your simple efforts in prayer and reaching as you do now at this moment, are having their effects upon this world.

As your numbers grow and your efforts increase, so this great lattice of light, this net of love, will be strengthened and will grow. This is all part of God’s plan, beloved souls. Each one of you may indeed be a part of this. All that is required is your sincere prayers and your time to be with God and to think of your brothers and sisters in prayer, to reach out with your hearts and acknowledge this gift of fellowship. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Andrew and may God’s Love continue to inflow into your precious souls and continue to awaken to your great potentials and gifts, to bring this beautiful truth of love to mankind. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you.
