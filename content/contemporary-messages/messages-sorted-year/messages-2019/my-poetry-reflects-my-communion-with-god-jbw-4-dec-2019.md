# My Poetry Reflects my Communion with God

December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Received by Jimbeau Walsh.

Waianae, HI, U.S.A.

 

Thank you for honoring my work and my words. I was in deep communion with God and I was also quite a rascal. This is reflected in much of my poetry. It’s also in my life, not everyone revered those words. I often found myself in trouble with authorities because they felt that I was outside the boundaries of religious belief. As you may know I was refused a burial in my religion. Yet today you might have to wait hours just to walk past where my body was laid. 

I tell you this because of what you have discovered of God’s Love, and you also find that it is sometimes considered outside the boundaries of religious belief. You may be accused of not being a good Christian or as I was told, “You are not a Muslim.” These words are blasphemous. Yet my communion with God was so deep I could express it. There were those who always understood me and my words affected their souls. 

Now of course, I am honoured. I had never thought about being honoured in the West but there are those who have translated my words in many languages. There is one, the young Daniel,<sup>1</sup> who actually is able to understand my words just in the same manner as I speak them to this one, this instrument, who is speaking on my behalf or rather that I am speaking through, as you call it “channeling.”

So what you read now of Hafiz is where my soul is now. I am in God’s Love. I am in that Celestial Kingdom that you all wish to go. My soul when on Earth wanted nothing but God, wished for nothing more than this communion. Therefore, despite the things I believed in, which when I crossed over found out: “No, not exactly like that, Hafiz.” So I was re-educated in some ways on my entrance into the spirit life but because of my communion with God, all these issues were superfluous. 

So again, as you go and speak the Truth, and you are so blessed to have it, all of you, do not be turned back or offended when you are not understood because you will be as I was and am. Let this Love of God permeate your being, awaken your souls, until your mere presence, the presence of love is more powerful than any words you might say. But when you do say them or when you sing them or when you write them with the Love of God in your soul, they will have a transformative power to touch those who hear and see and read. 

So walk this Earth with the joy of God in your heart and in your soul as I did. There is no force greater than God’s Love. You know this. Thank you for honouring me. I wish to honour you. May all fear and doubt, reluctance leave you as you open to the Divine Love. Thank you. May God bless you in every way, every day. I am your brother and friend in God’s Love, Hafiz.

**Note 1** This is a great compliment to Daniel Ladinsky of whom Wikipedia says: 

Daniel Ladinsky (born 1948) is an American poet and interpreter of mystical poetry, born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. Over a twenty-year period, beginning in 1978, he spent extensive time in a spiritual community at Meherabad, in western India, where he worked in a rural clinic free to the poor, and lived with the intimate disciples and family of Meher Baba.

He has written four works based on poetry of 14th-century Persian Sufi poet Hafiz: I Heard God Laughing (1996), The Subject Tonight Is Love (1996) The Gift (1999), and A Year With Hafiz: Daily Contemplations, (2011) as well as an anthology, Love Poems from God: Twelve Sacred Voices from the East and West (2002), and The Purity of Desire: 100 Poems of Rumi (2012). In introductions to his books, Ladinsky notes that he offers interpretations and renderings of the poets, rather than literal or scholarly translations. His work is based on conveying and being "faithful to the living spirit" of Hafiz, Rumi, and other mystic poets.
