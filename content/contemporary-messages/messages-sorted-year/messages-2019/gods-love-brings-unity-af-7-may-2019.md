Each of you walks a unique journey to God. Each of you carries a unique purpose that God has placed within your souls. Each of you sees the world from your own eyes that are unique in their perceptions and understandings of the world. It is the Love of God, the blessings of His Love within your souls that brings unity. It brings a sense of one another that is deep and powerful that comes from the soul as the soul is awakened with God’s Love. You will be able to see one another in different lights, different ways of knowing, in ways that engender connection and love and acceptance and understanding. 

You will feel a part of a great brother and sisterhood, members of a family that is the family of God. In this you will know that you are not alone. In this you will know that you are a part of a wondrous collection of souls claimed by God and when you walk in this Light, this beautiful Light of God’s creation, the beautiful Light of His Love that awakens your soul and awakens your consciousness to this wonderful sense of belonging and connection. You will know that you are loved not only by God but by all of those who are with you and accepting this Love and accepting this way of being in the world.
You draw to yourself a great power. The power of that Love that is shared, that unifies your souls, opens the doors to many blessings and the possibilities of being a powerful channel of Love in the world. Great blessings that can come with this sense of unity, with this reality of being together in Love, souls at one with God, souls in oneness with God. 

How God may use those of you who are willing to reach out to another, to another, to another, unifying this great power of Love that rests within your souls, that originates from God’s Great Soul. Beloveds, how powerful you can be! How bright and beautiful you can be in connection and conjunction with your brothers and sisters in the world! Time and space, these material matters mean nothing in this connection, in this unification of souls resonating together in Love. How God may use you as His channels of love. This resonance of the hearts beating as one can bring a mighty blessing to many and draw in many to this family of love. 

Continue to pray for the opening of your soul to receive this great blessing. Continue to open yourselves to one another in love. To allow the transformational Touch of God’s Love to expand out and touch another. Allow this beautiful Light to bond you forever in the eternal progression towards at-onement with God. God is with you, beloved souls. God will carry you. God will show you the way and bring you to that place of deep love and acceptance of all, bringing together humanity in harmony, that all that is not of God may fall and all that is in harmony with God may flourish. 

May God bless you, beloved souls, I am Andrew and my love is with you, beloveds. Always I am with you for I am part of your family and I love you all. God bless you. God bless you.
