Mark received by Al Fike

May the mantel of peace be upon you, beloveds, and His Love find a constant inflowing into your souls. We are so very pleased with the outcomes that have brought you to a place of leadership, my beloved son, that you have followed your guidance, have accepted the invitation to lead this little church. I must say that in this leadership will come many blessings and guidance that will lead to surprising outcomes. The congregation of your church will grow and you will have the opportunity, as will others, to teach this Truth of Divine Love to those who are seeking and open to this gift.

Allow yourself to be guided, dear son. Allow our guidance to come through you for this church. When you congregate together in your meetings, when you are prompted, allow us to speak and we will bring relevant information for all involved, wisdom and guidance, so that this church may flourish in Love and Light. Do not plan to any great detail the future of this church but rather listen to the promptings that God will give to your soul and our guidance that will come and inform you and suggest the next steps.

You are building something that will eventually be strong and a force to reckon with in the upcoming changes and conditions of your world, a beacon of light in the darkness, a place that will calm the troubled hearts of those who seek truth and upliftment. We are building a great portal there, beloved souls, something that will bring many manifestations and blessings forth within this church. Though many may not recognize or understand what a beautiful gift God has given, they will be touched and come to know this place as a holy refuge blessed by God.

Step by step, my son, we will build this refuge together and the Light of God will shine brightly. His Love will permeate. His Truth will be spoken and demonstrated. There is much work to do and we are eager to guide you forward, all involved in this. Those dilemmas and problems that are presented at this time will dissipate quickly given the approach of love rather than a desire to control.

Pray for each member of this church that wishes to serve in this sanctuary. Give your love and support be discerning. Know that each soul has something to give and your challenge, dear son, is to help nurture their souls and their capacity to give in Light. This is a test. It is an opportunity for you to grow, for you to understand how to inspire others and to do so with wisdom and grace. It will not be us who will be speaking to each individual, but it will be you who has taken on this role as spokesman and channel of love and truth for God. And so, each opportunity brings its blessings along with its challenges. You must step forward, beloved son, with strength and a desire to serve in humility and love for your soul shines in this Light, your gifts begin to emerge, and will find an opportunity to be expressed in this place of Light.

Allow God’s Touch to touch all deeply. Your presence and the presence of those who are indeed inspired by God’s Love and blessed within their souls will bring much change to this place and awaken a renaissance of spirituality in its true and highest form in this place. There are many gifted people there who require uplifting and awakening on deeper levels of the soul so that their gifts may shine forth with a profound depth, with beautiful love, with awakened wisdom.

This will come, beloved souls, given your willingness to walk on the highest path and seek the highest in wisdom and love. So it will come. It will come readily and with power and grace and peace.

God bless you, beloved son and beloved daughter and all who seek to serve in this way, so God’s Hand is upon you in your efforts. There is no need to shout to the rooftops that God has blessed you such. Instead, quiet, humble, but powerful counsel for this church is desirable. God bless you. I am Mark  I am with you every step, I am with you. God bless you.
