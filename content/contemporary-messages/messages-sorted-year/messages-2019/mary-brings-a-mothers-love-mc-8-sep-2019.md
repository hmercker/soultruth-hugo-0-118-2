# Mary Brings a Mother’s Love to Souls on Earth

Received by Maureen Cardoso


I join you in your time of prayer, where you open your soul, longing to be touched by the Grace of God and to be washed and cleansed by this Love. I am Mary. 

I bring my love, my tender sense, to wash over each one of you, to uplift you and to alleviate any worries and concerns that you may have from your material world, through your daily tasks, the many demands that are put upon you. I bring a mother’s touch; a soft, gentle and most tender love to be shared with you. 

For God has graced me deeply, my soul illuminated and burning brightly with the Grace of Divine Love. All Celestial angels have this Grace, but each of us have our unique gifts. The uniqueness of my gift is that of a mother whose love shines upon the children of Earth, whose grace touches all, and who is there to uplift, uplift you all and to bring comfort. For this is one of the great missions that God has given me and left me in charge of. So it is a great, great privilege to serve the children of Earth, to wipe their tears when they are in sorrow, to dance with them when they are in joy, and to walk beside them when they call. 

So may each of you feel the tenderness of my love and the deep care that I have for you. As you pray for this great Love of God’s Divine Essence to touch your soul, to cleanse the impurities, and awaken truth within you, may you step one foot in front of the other with confidence and a deep knowing that God is with you. He allows and asks us, your Celestial teachers, to come to you in service on your path of at-onement to the Great Oversoul.
