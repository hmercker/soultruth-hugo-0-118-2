# God's Love and the Eternal Progresss of the Soul

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Seretta Kem. The work of the soul is never complete beloveds, for the soul continues to evolve and progress for all eternity. And when you begin this journey, by eliciting the blessings of God within your soul, to receive His Essence, awakening all the faculties within, you come to understand that the limitations of the soul are only there because you have restricted it within your mind. The soul has no limitations as it grows in the Divine Love, the Essence of God, which in itself is not limited, and may be received within the soul for all eternity, given your desire to receive, to absorb, and to allow it to be the very focus of your existence.

So my beloved friends, do not restrict the awakening of your soul with your mind. Instead, allow God free reign. Allow God to guide you forward, to continue to pour His Essence within you, and you will welcome a journey, a path that is endless, filled with many, many insights, experiences, times of great joy and bliss. Where the conditions of your Earth become less of an issue, less of a challenge, for you have shifted your awareness and your focus, not upon the material conditions of your world and the demands of this world, but upon the eternal progress of your soul. There is no greater journey, no greater blessing, no more powerful a gift, than the awakened soul blessed by Godâ€™s Love. In this way, all will follow, all will fall into place, all will be recognized and awakened.

Allow God to guide you forward and gift you with deep insight. Allow the desires of your soul to awaken all that is within you through prayer, through going to God in all simplicity and innocence and love. God bless you beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. God bless you.
