# May God's Love Wash Over You

January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mary received by Maureen Cardoso

Beloved souls, I am Mary. I come to join you and say a great blessing, a prayer for each one of you, that the loving waters of Godâ€™s Love may wash over you and cleanse you, bringing deep peace and healing to each one of you. I bring my love to you, my love for the children of Earth is very dear. I feel a very tender place for each one of you. I feel as though I am like your heavenly mother watching over with great tenderness and care, praying for you so that our beloved Father will be near, will bring you a great blessing of Divine Love upon your souls.

Know that when you gather in this way and when you pray on your own that I am with you. My love is with you. Dearly beloveds, continue in this way to establish these deep bonds of love and care and growth, supporting one another with your love that flows through your soul giving support and guidance to one another. I send a great blessing to you, my beloveds. My love is with you. I am Mary and God bless you.
