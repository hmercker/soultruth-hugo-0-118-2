It is important it is at this time to walk in the Light, to be attuned to God, to continue to awaken to the inflowing of God’s Love into your soul. Crucial times indeed as the changes in the Earth continue to escalate so the changes within yourself continue to grow as God prepares you, awakens you to your purpose and destiny in the world. Do not waste a moment, beloved souls. Do not take anything for granted for the blessings and opportunities that are poured upon you at this time are the results of great efforts from we in spirit and the great blessings of God upon you.

You are indeed living a privileged life, a life that is richly blessed and filled with many possibilities. Consider this with each day. Consider what God has given you, beloved souls. See with the eyes of your souls what is truly given, how deeply blessed you are, how wondrous is this road that you take and how fortunate it is that you have chosen this road. For it has been your choice, beloveds. It has been your soulful desire to walk this road. This you must teach that when the soul is truly committed to God, when the soul continues to open to God, to receive this great blessing of Love, so the road opens, so the light encapsulates your life and changes all.

This is the power of God’s Love, the power of Truth, the blessing of the Heavenly Father upon you. Blessed souls, you are truly, truly in God’s care and Love. Call upon your Heavenly Father to continue to awaken you and to uplift you and bless you and that the flow of your life, the flow of all the experiences and elements of your life continue to be blessed by God even those things that are not gratifying to you, those challenges that are set before you. 

So this blessed life that you lead is a testimony to the light within your soul and the choices that you have made and a great gift not only for you but for those who observe you, who are a part of your life, who you are teaching and mentoring you in the ways of God’s Love. As God gifts you, so this gift multiplies out into the world. It is always thus with God. A blessing from God is not just for one particular person but for many. It reverberates out. It circles those whom you love. It assists those who assist you. So it is with others who are also blessed. What comes is a blessing to you. This is how the Truth, the ways of Love will be demonstrated and reinforced and strengthened in your world, reverberating and touching many, even those you do not know as even those you do not know are affected by this. 

For as this great Lattice of Light builds in the world, it is meant to transfer these energies conducting them through this network, touching others. As this Lattice grows, so the power of its blessing for each one will intensify. You will feel its purpose and mechanism affecting you, blessing you, supporting and uplifting you. As with these Portals of Light, as is all the blessed beautiful bright souls whom you meet. As this continues to grow and strengthen, as your efforts continue to grow and strengthen, as you meet those blessed souls who have purpose in this world, God’s children of Light, so you build a vast network and are a part of vast network that has been blessed by God and touches many.

The Light is growing in your world and because of the fortuitous position and time that you live within, that Light is more readily growing and reinforced in your world. All works for good, for Light, for Truth. You are truly a part of this, beloved souls, truly instruments in the flow of God’s Will and God’s Plan for the Salvation of Humanity. As you continue to brighten within your soul, as you continue to see and know within your minds and recognize the path that is to be taken, so your instrumentality, the power of what emanates through you continues to enliven the network, enliven the work, the connections, the touch that flows through you to others.

Do not judge those who do not see the world as you do. Do not judge those who carry error, but love them. Love them with all your heart and soul as the Grace of God continues to flow through you. For it is the power of Love, the power of the Truth that you carry, the power of the Grace of God’s Presence in your life that will change the minds of those you meet. God is doing this work, beloved souls. It is God’s Plan. It is God’s efforts. It is God’s Touch and influence. 

Your part within this plan is not as great as you might suppose but it is necessary. It is a necessary component of this great effort. For you have the gift of being in the flesh and there is a certain power and blessing to this fact. So you are an important component, but remember that what you do, you do for God. What is done through you is God’s work initiated and blessed by God. In this, one must be humble and listen with great intensity and commitment to the guidance given. 

You will not be overwhelmed by the human condition or by those who have different ideas and opinions. You are much stronger than this, beloved souls. Do not fear this. Do not even consider this but be strong in your own perception of Truth, in the Light within your soul and your sure knowledge of God’s Love and of God. In this way no one can assail you or pull you from your road that you have chosen to travel.

There is much work coming and with all of this work there is and will be much in the way of challenges. The world is full of the mindful, the world is full of judgment, the world is full of fear and the world is full of error. You cannot walk and wade in amongst humanity without experiencing this condition. So you must accept that not all that you speak of will be accepted by others. But know that you plant the seeds of Truth and you do so beautifully my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. You do so with integrity, with commitment, with harmony. That is all that can be expected of you, beloved souls. 

Though you would like to see many capitulate from their error and join the ranks of Truth and harmony and Love, I say to you in time this will be the case. In time, as you grow, as the conditions change in your world, as your work expands and the power of love that you carry is easily and readily felt by others, so your work will become more intense and penetrating in the ways of showing your brothers and sisters the Truth. You will continue to serve God and be guided by God, beloved souls. 

You know how deeply loved you are, beloveds, how deeply loved and how pleased we are that you continue to heed the call of service and love for humanity. Continue on in your efforts, in your desire and capacity to love your brothers and sisters. Continue on in harmony and love and you will be uplifted and blessed by God.

God bless you, beloved souls. Your teacher Augustine ever by your side, ever seeking to assist you in your understanding and your soulful awakening to the Truth. God bless you. God bless you.
