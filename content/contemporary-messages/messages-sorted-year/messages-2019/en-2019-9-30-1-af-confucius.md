God bless you, my beloved little birds. I am Confucious. How fortunate you are, beloveds, to live where you do, to have a life that has many possibilities and blessings, to live in a place in this world of yours that is resplendent in beauty, that is close to God's Creation. May your hearts recognize the blessings of God’s Touch upon each one of you and upon your lives, beloveds, that you are not abandoned and alone, you are not unloved and uncared for. Instead, God continues to pour His blessings upon you.You have one another and others in your lives whom you love.

Though I know you each have your challenges, beloved souls, but those challenges can bring you great soul awareness and strength. They are a gift, provided you are willing to see the wisdom of the soul that which is given to you in your life experience as a gift from God, that you may stand upright in light, be strong in love, be at peace, and allow yourself to release all conditions that are not of love within you.

God will uplift you, beloveds, and ensure that you are in that place of peace and joy. It comes with the blessing of the Father's Love, does it not? This beautiful upliftment and light, healing and peace that comes as you walk in light, you walk in the faith, and you walk with the yearning of your soul to be with God.
