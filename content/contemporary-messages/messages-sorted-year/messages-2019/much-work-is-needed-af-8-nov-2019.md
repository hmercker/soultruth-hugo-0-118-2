# Much Work is Needed to Rectify Disharmonious Conditions

Received by Al Fike



There is much work that needs to be done in this world. Much work to rectify the disharmonious conditions, the lack of love, the lack of human respect and acknowledgement for one another. In this circle there are many who continue to work towards these ends. We acknowledge these efforts, this time that is being spent to serve the Source of All, to be channels for all those who live on this Earth. 

Each of you, in your own way, walk this path of Light and service. Each of you continues to explore the possibilities of service, to find truth, to work towards the great Truth of God. Indeed, may His Love continue to rain down upon you all, beloved souls. May your numbers grow as they are needed. May there be many opportunities for each one of you to grow within your souls, that place that is the center of your being, and to awaken to ever more Truth, more understanding. 

God continues to bring you together, my friends, and to help you to truly see one another and acknowledge the Lights that you are. Though perspectives may be different, words may be different, labels, understandings of the mind, but in your hearts, you are together, my friends. You are truly together. May you continue to forge these connections, these places of heartfelt understanding. In this way, the power of your work will intensify and multiply by your contributions to the whole that is this great endeavour to awaken humanity and bring them to truth. 

May you be blessed upon that road, beloved friends. Continue to see your way through all that is not of Light and to be in Light always. Blessings to you, beloved friends. Godâ€™s blessings upon all to bring harmony and peace to the world. 

I am Melchizedek and I am happy to be with you, beloved friends. Blessings indeed, to all.
