# Feel the Power of this Light

November 8<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Bayview, Sydney, NSW, Australia

Jesus received by Maureen Cardoso

Beloved children, receive this blessing, feel the power of this Light that you draw forth and I bring forward. Let this healing and this blessing permeate your being allowing that which is not in harmony to be washed for I stand at your feet bringing the power of my light, my force, my essence into your midst, the Love of God shining down upon us, clearing, washing, bringing forward the purity of God’s Love into your souls. Open, beloved children, open. Let this Love touch you in a way you have not felt before.

I walk with you and together we shall bring the message of God’s Love into the midst of the beloved souls who will gather. You do my work and I walk with you. God bless you. God bless you this day and all days as you work together bringing forward this powerful message, sharing with individual souls the way they may come to know our beloved Creator.

God bless you, my children. God bless you. I am Jesus. God bless you.
