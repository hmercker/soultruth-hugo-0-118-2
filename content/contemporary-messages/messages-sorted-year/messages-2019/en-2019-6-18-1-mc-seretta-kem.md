Seretta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

Good morning, it is Seretta Kem. I wish to let you know that we have been with you both closely, during your time in the place of this Healing Centre, helping to establish and strengthen the Portal of Light in this place; assisting you in sharing the Truth of God’s Love with those you sat in circle with and you spoke to. It is not often recognized, the depth and the level of shifts and change that happens when you move about your world, for, there are many things unseen and not known that we in spirit have the ability to perform and utilize, through the instrumentality of those who serve God.

We are pleased with the outcome of this journey. As you continue to return to this place of healing, time and time again, it will continue to build upon this foundation. Though it may seem a slow moving forward, we wish to let you know that things are moving according to the plan. The gentle approach that you have, the kindness and the openness of heart and the willingness to meet people where they are at, is instrumental. For it allows people to have a trust, to relax, and to see a connection formulating. You have been witness to this experience, for you have made further contact with the local people. This is important to establishing friendship and to simply be part of the experience that is unfolding in this healing place.

Yes, there are many new programs and those who wish to share the teaching of their programs, flowing though this building. This will continue to happen for as greater Light emanates from this building, it will continue to attract more and more souls. As you have heard time and time again from those local people, how they have been attracted there, those who have walked by this place many a time. It is just now that they have chosen to step foot into the building and found themselves a place of comfort, a place to connect, a place to share and a place to grow.

The teachings of God’s Love is one every important teaching that will come into this building. We assure you that we are working diligently for this to unfold. It will require your patience and perseverance and your willingness to hear the call of God. For God will call you back and you will hear the call and you once again, will willingly return for it is placed within your soul to follow the Will of God. As you have experienced when you were following the Will of God and the guidance given, all unfolds with ease, grace, and peace. Each journey will have its unique experience. This, one must stay open to, the unique experience of each journey one is sent upon.

We celebrate what has unfolded in this journey to this Healing Centre. As you now, this day, move forward on to your new location, where you will meet the dear soul who wishes to establish a Circle of Light in his land where he lives and has lived his life, we will accompany you, as you journey forward and while you are together. We will be with you as you pray in this healing chapel. We will be with you, helping to establish great Light there, but it will require your time in prayer.

So, though thenthere is much to see in this beautiful place that you will visit, please do not be distracted by what is the purpose of this journey: establishing the Light in this centre. So, we ask that each day, you have a prayer. If you are able to have more than one prayer there a day, this will be good. But my friends, this is what is your purpose there: to pray in this healing chapel and to establish a Light, help to establish this Light. We commit to our part. We ask that you commit to your part. This is not to say that you cannot explore this beautiful island, but I just wish to remind you and to influence you, with the importance of your presence in bringing the Essence of God’s Love alive in this place.

It will be a joyful reunion. Yes, our dear Goldie will be with you. The joy will be felt. There will be a lightness of heart, much conversation upon your spiritual paths. God’s plan for you is rich, full of Love, harmony, and joy. God bless you on this day and your time together. We will be with you.

I am Seretta Kem. God bless you. My love is always with you and I stand by you. God bless you.
