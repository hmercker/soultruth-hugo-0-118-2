# The Gift of Mediumship Grows As the Soul Progresses

November 27<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Sydney, Australia

Augustine received by Maureen Cardoso

It’s Augustine. The gift of mediumship is something that shifts and changes and strengthens as the medium continues to progress upon their path. It is a unique coming together when there is more than one medium present in Circle. For different groups, combination of individuals that gather does to some degree determine which medium the Celestial teachers will speak through. Yet it is something that each medium requires to have their gift be exercised so to speak. Then does the soul progresses into greater Light and faith deepens within the individual and their gift of mediumship strengthens and broadens. There is a greater sense of what you say may be confidence within the medium. This all takes time.

We could use this instrument as an example in the way when we began to work with her, we certainly spent a bit of time prior to speaking through her of giving her some idea of what we would be speaking about. For we also need to nurture the confidence that each individual may have some degree of vulnerability with their gift where they are wondering *“will they make sense?”, “will what comes through formulate into a message that has meaning?”.*

Our beloved instrument who we have been using for many years whose gift you have all witnessed strengthened is quite adept and comfortable in his gift and has moved into a place where he has great faith and trust that we his angel friends will deliver a message through him that will be comprehensive and that will reach the needs of the mind and the questions of the mind of those sitting in Circle and also bring forward guidance and direction upon awakening the soul.

So allowing one’s gift in this way to progress, for faith come, and trust be present does take time and does take practice. We wish to say that we are well-pleased in the way in which you support one another in this gift and the way that you will continue to support the mediums whose gifts have recently opened and will open. For you know and understand that it does require a certain level of faith and trust and a willingness to be vulnerable to some degree allowing us to speak.

Each of you are in your own degree of awakening. It is truly you who can have the closest measure of your experience of the gift being used. You can see your own progression from when it awakened and your gift and instrumentality was birthed to where you are present day.

Our beloved instrument Albert, we thank you for your willingness to serve, to serve many as you have had thousands of messages come through you. In your humility, you continue to serve and allow your gift to be awakened. We have all witnessed the changing dynamic where you may sit in rapport with the angels in, as you call it, question and answer. This will continue to strengthen and we will continue to use you in such a way. We will continue to use you, dear son, in helping others’ mediumships.

Mediumship gifts open where you will feel guided to help a particular person sit next to you for it is true by osmosis the chemicals that are within you will blend together. So you assist us in these gifts of other mediums. You have given us the opportunity to some degree to set a standard. Though it is not necessary that each medium use this standard and they have their uniqueness and we will also use them in their unique way. But your integrity and the way you serve has been instrumental for other mediums to see what is possible. So we thank you, dear son, and we encourage you to continue to awaken and allow God to use your gift in service and allow your angel friends to continue to reach many. There is not another soul on Earth that we can speak so clearly through. I know you will humbly accept that statement. It is important that you stay humble with that statement.

Our beloved Jimbeau, we are thrilled and delighted that even through your reluctance you allow us to speak. This is changing. You are more relaxed allowing us to come through you and delivering messages of love, encouragement where others can relate. There is a depth of love that streams through you in your messages. That will continue to grow and strength. Your beloved Yogananda continues to want to work through you. Allow your gift, dear son, to progress and it shall be one day. It will all come together. Just as you do, allow things to flow. Allow God’s Love to serve through you. Your music is instrumental in bringing many blessings. It raises the vibration in the Circle. Allow your gift, dear son, to continue to progress and so it shall through the awakening of your soul. Allowing any shadows, hurts, and wombs, just as you sing in your songs, those beautiful lyrics, allow God to melt, to melt those, dear son, and you will witness your gift and the other gifts that you carry awaken. You are a dearly and deeply loving soul, tender in God’s Love. We are with you always.

For this instrument and her gift of mediumship, she does desire to serve and she is serving. She is quite clear in what you may call boundaries. Boundaries in a way that she knows what serves her. She knows what is necessary in awakening her gifts deeper. She is moving through a profound inward journey where her eyes are being opened to many intricate aspects seeing life through a different lens. There are other gifts that are being awakened within her which she senses. She understands within herself the need to have the space and the time to nurture these gifts. For within her and she is one who feels these many changes, can put her to some degree feeling a little off-course or imbalanced. One of her guiding posts that has been with her her entire life is “in what way can I reach peace in this moment?”. Her guiding post has always been inner peace. So as she moves through these many changes that are occurring within her physical body, her sensitivity to these shifts and changes does require some solitude. So if you observe her quiet, it is her nurturing these aspects.

As the mediums continue to open in your presence, you have witnessed the dear soul in Fitzroy Falls. Your support and your love of their journey is important. It is a great service that is opening to God, these many mediums. We have been working to help their gift open. You will witness more mediums open within your presence. The strength that you bring, the safety that is present in the Circle when you are present allows them to be vulnerable and to allow their gift to come into service.

So my dear friends, as your teacher and your guide, I applaud you all. We in the Celestial Heavens dance with joy as we see God’s plan unfolding before our eyes. There is great joy in the Celestial Heavens for your progression and your willingness to be of service. God bless you all on this day. May it be a day of peace and joy and love as you scatter about enjoying the sights, enjoying the water, enjoying the music. God bless you, dear souls. I am your teacher Augustine. I have great love for each one of you. God bless you.
