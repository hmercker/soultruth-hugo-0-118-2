It is Lotus Blossom. Many of you in this Circle have the gift of healing. I am assisting and working with each of you to open the flow of energies, of healing energies which God wishes to have come through you to assist in the healing of others. Some of you have taken formal training in healing modalities and some of you have not. It is not necessary for those who have not had any formal training to do so for when you are an instrument of God, your presence brings forth the energies through you. You may touch another in a very simple way without the intention of healing and God will use this an opportunity to have those energies flow through you.

So there are many ways of healing. Those of you who offer healing to others and have had some training, this is good, for God will continue to open this gift and your instrumentality. All that is necessary is that you come humbly to the one who is coming to you for healing, placing your hands upon the individual and asking God to guide your hands and open to what God has to give through you for this individual. It is not necessary that you mindfully manipulate the session.

What is important is that you feel and allow the energies to flow, become acutely aware of the guidance and the healing angels that will work through you and with you in your sessions who will assist you. It is not necessary to know the outcome of the healing session. It is helpful to explain to the one who is coming for healing that you are an instrument for God. The design of the healing is in God’s Hands and the willingness of the individual to be healed for their free will can inhibit or enhance the healing. In respect of the one who comes to you for healing, their faith is instrumental in what they will allow God to do for them at that particular time.

So as in any other form of instrumentality for God, your part is to be and allow God to work through you, to quiet the mind and to allow your entire being to receive the gift of healing energies and for those energies to be transmitted upon the one before you. Your simple presence is a healing gift. Often words are not needed. A gentle touch and a loving gaze into another’s eyes can be enough.

As you awaken more fully in your soul, your gift of healing will change, will grow, and will develop. Many wonderful experiences may be channeled through you while you are facilitating the healing through your instrumentality. Do you best not to be distracted by these experiences and allow them to come and go for this is in the flow. When you focus on one experience, you are preventing others from coming to you and through you. Simply awaken to allowing this River of God’s Love to continuously flow through you moment to moment and you will be a profound instrument of healing for your Heavenly Father. Allow your gift to be awakened, beloveds. Allow yourself to be used in a gracious way that God desires to use you. 

I am Lotus Blossom and my love is with each and every one of you. May the Grace of God’s Love shower upon you bringing healing and awakening. God bless you.
