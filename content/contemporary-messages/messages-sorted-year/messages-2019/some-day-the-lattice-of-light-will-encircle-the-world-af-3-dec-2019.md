God bless you, my friends. I am Michael Collier. Yes, I may travel beyond the shores of that distant land (Australia) and be with you today and speak with you today. I wish to speak about how important it is to knit this community together in love. To continue to forge the networks, the lattice of light amongst you and amongst those who are curious, who come to hear you speak of the great Truth of the Father’s Love. As you reach out, my beloved friends, so you help to knit the world together from many different places beyond the epicenters of your prayerful Circles into the world in distant places, places that you do not know of at this time, individuals who are watching you, mortals upon this Earth who are curious, and those who have an interest in your work.

These beautiful souls will in time forge a connection and add that string of Light from them to you. And so it will go, this great forging of the network, this knitting of the community together, creating such a force amongst you as you continue to pray together and be brothers and sisters in this great effort to bring Light and Truth to the world. Each of you has something to contribute to this. Every time you pray and every time you think of a brother or sister, you are all together in this wave of Light that exists in the world because of your prayers and your efforts, enhanced by the efforts of the angels to bring greater light to your world. Every time a thought is given, an intention, a prayer, even a dream, these things help to knit you together to forge the love bonds that are so necessary in order to ensure that you are all secured in this movement of Light and Love and Truth in the world.

And it will grow, my friends, it will grow. There will be many, many more who will voluntarily and eagerly become a part of this movement, this effort to bring Truth. God is working to bless many souls, not only through you but through many. The angels are working in relation to God to ensure that you are all a part of one beautiful wave of Light reaching out around the globe and touching many.

As you continue to grow in light, as you continue to understand for yourselves this great Truth and as you share this Truth with others and you feel inspired to do so, you will help to connect these strands of Light together into a great network. Continue to pray for this. Continue to seek to be an active agent for God, to connect soul to soul. Your beautiful souls filled with intention, filled with Love, filled with the desire to reach out to your brothers and sisters. 

You do God’s work when you acknowledge this place within you, that place that is within your soul that is earnest and desires to bring together your brothers and sisters in this beautiful experience of receiving the gift of the Father’s Love. Together in your prayers, you build a beautiful condition of LIght and you have been told that many spirits gather around you with curiosity, with desire, with the wonderment of witnessing such Light upon the earth plane. The power of the earth plane to bring Truth through God’s various instruments and mediums and beautiful souls, who are eager to express and be an instrument of Light in the world, will be utilized in many ways with flowing and powerful ways, which will touch many souls both here in your world and the next. 

It is part of God’s plan that you continue to grow together, my friends, and you continue to be knitted together, a great tapestry of love that is beautiful and is growing in beauty with each day as you grow in love with each day. So the power of your efforts collectively will bring change to the world more powerfully than if you were separated and alone. Though this too brings its power to the world, together it is multiplied and exponential in its effects and power to touch other souls. 

You will see the momentum growing, my beautiful friends. You will see how these simple efforts and simple prayers will touch many souls, many souls who are being drawn, who will come and be a part of these Circles of Light. Those of you who are able and willing to travel the world, you are powerful instruments and activators of these Circles of Light in the world that will in turn touch and activate other Circles until the world is rife with great and beautiful Circles of Light connected by this Lattice and empowered by the great Portals of Light that God will touch within these dedicated Circles that continue to unfold my friends. This great plan of God continues to unfold and is beautiful to behold.

May God bless you as you continue to grow in Light and be beautiful channels for God. Your prayers deepen, your prayers, intense and true, reach the great Soul of God, bringing a beautiful response that comes with the Holy Spirit touching your Soul.

We are all together at this moment, my friends, in prayer and eliciting the light bringing God’s Touch close to the Earth, to each one of you and strengthening the Lattice of Light that will in some day encompass the entire world and empower many souls to seek God that they may be inspired, that your prayers may inspire many, that our prayers may inspire many, and that God’s Touch may ignite a wondrous awakening of humanity.

May God bless each one of you, precious souls, for you are precious. You begin a great wave of change and healing and awakening in the world. That change will grow and expand and strengthen and wash over the world in beautiful Light, in great Love, in healing of all the hurts and pains and dilemmas of mankind. May you continue, my friends. So important to this work. Continue to be strong and faithful, to pray to be a part of this beautiful enriching of the planet with Love and Light.  

God bless you. I am Michael Collier and I work with you all as you continue to seek to serve God. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
