# Your Soul Continues to Awaken

December 19<sup>th</sup>, 2019

General Collection, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

I am Mylora. Have you ever seen a flower open to bloom fully with the warmth of the sun touching each petal? This takes time, it is a slow process. It awakens in its own time and within the flow of warmth and light, all the ingredients required to bring a flower to its fruition. So it is with you, my friends. It is slow, you cannot see it, the movement is so subtle. Yet with each of you, with the beautiful flower that is your soul responding to the warmth of God's Love, is surely opening and each petal reflects a gift, each series of petals colored in exquisite ways reflects the wonderment of your soul. You continue to unfold. You are beautiful souls and we marvel at this wondrous flower, so unique, so precious, so magnificent.

May you continue to acknowledge the beauty of your own soul, my friends, for you are blessed by the most beautiful Touch of God bringing to life all that you are, all beauty and the glorious, glorious creation that is your soul continues to awaken ever so slowly but surely within the grace of God. My love is with you. God bless you. Mylora. I am happy to be with you, beloved friends. God bless you.
