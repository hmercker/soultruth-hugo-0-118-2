# Many Souls Hunger for Truth, Light, Love

March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Manhattan, NY, USA

Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

Souls are hungering for light and love, truth and peace within. Many souls hunger for this, my brothers and sisters. Many souls are seeking for this truth and blessing. Yet, the current ideas and concepts and religious doctrine of the day seem to preclude direct access to God, the Source of All. Many believe that all is within them and this is the source for their spiritual nourishment. Many are afraid of God, for they are afraid of judgment and they are confused. They know not those parts within them that are indeed longing and can know God and all the wonderment of this relationship. Many are just mute and blind. They are not awake and they go along on their daily course without knowing the great blessings that may come, without knowing the powerfull love that is available to them that shines forth through every soul.

So is a sad state of affairs in your world, beloveds. One where many are lost. Many do not know how to come to God. Many are numb and asleep. Yet every individual in your world has a soul and every soul has some longing for God. So, my precious and beloved friends, you are blessed with this knowledge. You are coming awake to the potentials and beauty of your own soul and creation. You are journeying towards God, towards greater light and love.

This great blessing, the Divine Love of God, will continue to be available to you at any moment of any day. When your thoughts reach out to God, there will be a response, a blessing, a gift given to your soul. It is merely the longing of your soul, that desire deep within you that will ignite the response, the outpouring of blessings. In time, the universe of God’s creation will open to you in all kinds of ways, all manner of blessings, all openings and perceptions of the soul will awaken.

Beloveds, your efforts will be rewarded. Your prayers will be answered. Your longings are known by God. Continue to seek. Continue to open yourselves to this blessing and you will come to know all of which I speak. All the beauty and the glory, the love, the joy, the peace aqnd the truth will come to you, it will come in great abundance, a great feast for your soul, the spiritual awakening that is the desire of your soul so that you may indeed walk in this world as a light. God will use you as a channel of love for many. This too is your desire, beloveds, this too is your desire. Not just for the fulfillment of your own soul but to be used to bring greater light to your world.

It is God’s desire that you may indeed reach such a steadfast alliance between your soul and the soul of God that you may be used to be a channel of love and blessings, of truth and light for many. For there is a great need in your world, beloveds, a great need. You must be used and allowed to be used to ring the bell that awakens the soul, the many souls who are asleep. For the bell toll must come and the souls will awaken from their slumbers and come to know a deep and beautiful part of themselves that is unknown as of yet.

Each of you, beloved souls, will continue to awaken. You have with you an angel by your side. You are being guided. There is much that will be given. Those sensibilities within you, soul perceptions, are awakening. So, you will find yourself in the flow of God’s Will where you may act in harmony and love for the benefit of your brothers and sisters.

Yes, my beloveds, so much awaits. You continue to grow in love and light. Be steadfast in your prayers. Be open to your guidance. Allow God’s deep and holy Touch upon your soul. Await these things within and you will find that a deep peace will be in your life and a powerful truth in your consciences and a wonderful channel of love for all who will  pass by. This joy will be with every footfall. With every breath will come a deep joy, a deep peace, and a deep knowing that you are a child of God.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea, Keea Atta Kem. As you know, I am with you often as you continue upon these journeys, your truth and love, light and peace. I  bring many lights and colors to you, beloved souls, a blessing and a signal that I am close. When you see these things, know that I am close, that I will continue to bless you with these blessings and I will continue to uphold you in light and be with you in love. God bless you. I am Keea and I love you. God bless you.
