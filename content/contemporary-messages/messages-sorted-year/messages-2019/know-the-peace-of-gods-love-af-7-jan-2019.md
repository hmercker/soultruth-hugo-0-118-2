# Know the Peace of God’s Love

God uplifts you into light. As you continue to pray in this sanctuary and benefit from this portal of light, so you are uplifted. This light that is God’s Breath infuses every part of you bringing greater harmony to your being. As you open your souls to the great benediction from God and this Love that is His Essence, all the wondrous chambers of your soul will be awakened and all the beautiful gifts therein will come to the fore and bring to you a conscious understanding of the wonderment of life and the wonderment of God. 

It takes just a few moments of sincere prayer to open to God and to remove yourselves from your mental conditions and go deeper into your soul and be in that place of deep peace, deep joy, deep stillness and acknowledge the Light of God, the Breath of God and the many blessings that God has to give to you beloved souls. It is not only in this sanctuary, this place of light that you may do this. You may do this at any time and at any place to stop, to listen, to pray and to open up that awareness, that gentle calling from God that says: *“Come to me, I am waiting for you to come and I will bless you fully with such abundance, such abundance that you will not want for anything for you will be fulfilled within and know the wonderment of your own soul.”*

Be at peace, beloved souls. Know that you are loved. Feel the joy that is within that knowing. Feel the warmth and peace of God’s Touch in your soul. God’s Breath is upon you beloveds. Breathe in His Breath so that it may kiss your soul and awaken your true selves.

May God bless you deeply, beloved souls. I am Andrew and I continue to pray with this circle and tend to your needs spiritually. God bless you and keep you beloved souls. I love you all. God bless you.
