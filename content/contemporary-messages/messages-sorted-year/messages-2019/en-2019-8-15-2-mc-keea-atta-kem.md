I am Keea Atta Kem. I come to share a message of love in hopes to help you through your soul to reach to the Heavenly Creator, the Soul of God whose great blessing of Divine Love is awaiting your longing and your reaching, opening up to receive this great blessing and this great Touch. For when you gather in circles such as you are, a great light is seen far up into the Celestial Heavens where we reside and you draw us, your Celestial friends. For your desire and yearning for this great blessing of God's Love attracts us for there is not many souls upon your earth who understand this powerful gift, something that is so simple to receive, simply to be, to sit and to be, to be touched by God, to be changed by this essence of Love for great harmony, peace and joy to begin to formulate, a way of expression in your individual lives.

So when we, your Celestial friends, see beautiful souls such as you are gathered in circle with the intention and singleness of purpose to come to know God in this way. It is a great blessing and we are all too happy to come pray with you, to bring our love and our light to help you, to help you to feel, help you to connect, help you to release your worries and your cares that you all hold in this material life. This is part of our service and part of our serving God's Will is to help beloved souls to come to understand and awaken to their personal relationship through their soul to the beloved Creator. You each do have a Celestial angel that stands with you. As the dear soul was sharing, there is a beautiful Celestial angel that stands in the middle of your circle whose great spiritual power helps to bring down this beautiful energy and this portal of light reaching high up into the Celestial heavens and well down into your earth, expanding and blessing many.

You are the fortunate ones for you have listened to the call of your soul. There is something in you that continues to draw you, draw you into this prayer practice and has drawn you here this evening. There is something that you receive, something you may not be quite sure of, something that may be subtle, and something that may be very powerful. For you will all receive to varying degrees this Divine Love. It is based on your ability to open and to yearn and to desire and to reach. And as you do that your beloved Creator honors you and honors your request sending His messenger of His Love, the Holy Spirit, to bring this Love into your soul. This Love is yours forever, will reside within your soul for all eternity for the Father is the giver and you, beloveds, are the receiver. As you experience this Love and the many changes that it brings upon your soul, the truth of who you are, your true essence, this Love will root out conditions that are not in harmony. As you continue to pray and to return and sit with this stillness in an open heart and soul asking your beloved Creator to touch you yet once again, again the Father gives and you receive. It is an ongoing eternal communion.

Beloveds, God expects nothing of you. God does not judge you or condemn you. This is of your own doing upon yourself and upon others. As this Love that has been bestowed in your soul begins to be activated within your life, you will become more loving to yourself and to others with greater acceptance and tolerance and understanding for all. This is the truth of the Divine Love. This is what your souls are seeking. Though you may not understand by the concept of the mind, the knowings of your soul recognize and realize this essence. So my encouragement to you is to continue to return as often as you may be able, to come home to your Heavenly Father, soul to Soul, and unite in this great Love and with that many blessings are given to each and every one.

I will end my words here. I invite you once again to come into the soul, that deep place that is within you, longs to be loved, comforted, and cared for. In your mind with the essence of your soul's longing, ask your beloved Creator to touch you with the grace of His Divine Love. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea Atta Kem, here to serve. God bless you.
