# Put Light in the Darkness with Joy and Humor

August 7<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Jimbeau Tour, Monroeville, PA, USA

Charlie Chaplin received by Jimbeau Walsh

I want you to know I am not a Celestial Angel but I am a progressive spirit as I did not discover God’s Love until I crossed over. My beautiful mother, so troubled on Earth, had already become an angel. She has been my mentor and my guide. Oh, if I only knew on Earth what I know now and could have inserted my knowledge of God’s Love into my work. However, when I was in my soul, I was very happy. Even when I made films about social justice or injustice, I always inserted humor because I wanted to put the light on the subject as they say.

So, I won’t stay long, but I wish to encourage you all not to be too serious, to see the joy, to feel the joy, to see the humor, to put the light in the darkness, to carry a song in your heart. Share this with others. I thank you. My love to you. May God bless you all. I am Charles.
