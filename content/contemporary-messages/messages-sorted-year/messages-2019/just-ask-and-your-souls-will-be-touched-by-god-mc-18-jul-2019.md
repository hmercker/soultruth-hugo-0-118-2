I am here with you, I am Mary, the mother of Jesus. There are many Celestial angels that surround you who are praying with you and that stand with you, helping to bring you into a condition where you may be able to open your heart and open your souls more readily, to receive this healing Blessing of Divine Love from the Creator. This gracious Gift that awaits only your longing and your asking. At any moment, all souls, whether they are on Earth or in spirit, may be touched by the Love of God, should they only ask of their own free will. 

This message is the message that my son walked the Earth with, teaching mankind how to reach God; how to receive a Blessing from God; how to obtain at-onement with God. Unfortunately this pure Truth has been misconstrued in many of the teachings and the writings, though it is the highest Truth available, this Blessing of Love. When you open your heart, your mind and your soul to receive this great Blessing, God answers your call, bringing forth this Love through His messenger of Love, the Holy Spirit. These are the workings that the Holy Spirit is responsible for; carrying this Essence of Love upon its wings and reaching your souls. 

As you sit in circle such as you are, you draw us, the Celestial angels into your midst. The Celestial angels once also walked your Earth. They have had a human existence and whether finding this Truth on Earth or in spirit, began just as you are, began at a point, opening to this great Gift of Love, receiving this Gift and having their soul healed of errors and conditions of darkness and those things that are not in harmony with Love and God’s Creation.

This essence is an energy that accumulates in the soul which builds and grows and shifts and changes the soul from the image that it has been created in, into the very essence of God’s Love.  And as you carry this Love in your soul, your life is changed. Great harmony and peace and joy and Love may then reside within your soul and the way you express yourself, the way you see your life, the way you communicate with others is changed and Love is the currency which you express and live. 

And us, your Celestial teachers, have taken this very same path, the path of Divine Love, to obtain at-onement with our Creator. Our joy is ecstatic. You would not be able to comprehend the joy that we feel, for there are no words in your language or any language that can express this accurately. Our will is aligned fully with God’s Will and you too have that great possibility, that gift of knowing your beloved Creator’s Will for you. It is not something that you generate from your mind, for this would be your will being activated. But it is something that comes of the soul - a knowing that you carry within your soul and within your being. For God communes Soul to soul and it is the Creator’s desire that you come to know His Great Soul through this Essence of Love that He so desires to share with you. There is a bounty of Love available for each and every soul. The Love carried within your soul has a desire to be expressed in your life and emanate its great Light.

So we are available as you pray to your beloved Creator to touch you, to fill your heart and to fill your soul. We, your Celestial teachers come in service to pray with you, we bring our gifts and we help you. For this life on the Divine Path is eternal. We continue to expand for, there is no limit to what may come to us, how we continue to learn and grow in God’s great Truths. In this, beloved souls, the Divine Love will bring all Truths to you.

May you be blessed deeply as you sit in circle and receive this essence, and I will stay, as many other Celestial angels stay with you as well and pray for God’s essence.  We beloved souls, have the great Gift of a constant inflowing of God’s Love and we so desire our Earth friends to know this Love, to invite this Love and to live this Love. There is much Love here for you from God and all of us in spirit. 

May you be blessed. My love is with you. I am Mary and I reside high in the Celestial Heavens. God bless you, dear children. God bless you.
