My dear friends, I come with great joy to this Circle as your friend. There is much light in this place and there are many of us here. We bring the Father’s Love with us. We see into every soul and we know the longings of each one. Not in any invasive way, but we come to embrace you in the Creator’s Love that you may release your doubts and that there may come to you faith. 

Where you have been angry, fill it up with forgiveness. Where there is fear, let there be love and knowing you are loved. I ask you to consider your worthiness, because every child of God is worthy of receiving His Love in every moment. So I say to you, know that you are worthy and that when you receive this Love and you open up, it will transform you. It will heal those places where you have been blocked. This is the yoga of Divine Love. This is the practice that supersedes all others for those who wish to be at-one with the Creator, for those who wish their souls to awaken and progress towards the Celestial Heavens where every soul who asks and receives this Love, will find themselves. 

I come as your brother and friend and I love you all. May God bless you all with a great abundance of Love. Be in joy, be in love, let all else go. May God bless you. I am your brother, Yogananda
