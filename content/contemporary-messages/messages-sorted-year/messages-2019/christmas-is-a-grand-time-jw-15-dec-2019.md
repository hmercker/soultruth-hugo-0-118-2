# Christmas is a Grand Time to Share the Gift of Divine Love 


December 15<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here, Yogananda and I am honored to be welcome in this Circle, such beautiful hearts you have. When you pray and you feel the inflowing of the Creator’s Love, any separation that you feel is removed. In the Creator’s Love there is a oneness and while you retain your individuality, each one of you a beautiful unique soul and a creation of the Father, yet you become one in God’s Love. If you were lost, you feel found. If you were in doubt, you now have faith. If you were in despair, you feel hope because these are the signs of Divine Love. These are the gifts that are given in prayer. 

I know some of you struggle with this. In this busy world, so much to do, so many things to get done. You have been given very good minds indeed. Yet as I have said before, let your souls rise up in prayer that they may be in ascendency over your minds. Allow your soul to direct your mind that all things that are done will be done in love. All connections will have the Light in your soul as a gift to others. This is the greatest gift. This is the gift that was brought to Earth at Christmastime. This you know. What a beautiful time. A grand time to share this gift with family and friends. Your Light and your Love in God is a reminder to all. This is truly your gift. You have received it from God and you give to others. Let this be our Christmas wish for all. Fear not. There is hope. Doubt not. Have faith. Know that the Father’s Love is the Great Gift we share with you. 

All of my love and blessings. I am your friend and brother and I love you. I am Yogananda.
