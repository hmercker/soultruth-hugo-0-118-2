# Be Open and Receptive to What We - May Give to Each One of You

January 20<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Martha received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Martha. I wish to convey to you a message that each of you in the coming week will receive a sign, a vision, a message or an understanding within you that will help you in your daily efforts to receive the blessing of God’s Love within your soul and to exercise this truth within your lives.

Whatever be your gifts and your reception of understanding and communication with we in spirit, we will utilize these things to communicate with you and to establish a greater rapport with each one of you. So in your prayers, in your dreams, in your thoughts and in your daily expressions, be open and receptive to what we may give to each one of you. Because you are unique, the ways and means of communication will be unique, but there will be a gift, a pearl of wisdom, a blessing - something of significance will be given to each one of you in the coming week. When you come together again, it is our hope that you will share the wisdom that you have received and acknowledge with one another this gift that God wishes to give to each soul, and the many blessings that are within the great blessing of God’s Love.

God Bless you beloveds. I am Martha, and the angels will be close, beloved souls, close to each one of you. Pray to be open and receptive to this gift. God bless you and keep you in His Love. God bless you.
