Andrew received by Al Fike

You will walk many roads together, beloveds. At times you will work together for God. God has a plan for the salvation of mankind and each of you within your souls desires to serve as an instrument within that plan. There will be times when God will call upon you and ask for you to dedicate some time and service, to reach out to others and speak the Truth of His Love. If that be the case, then God will open the way for you to serve. All will be in harmony, for when you follow God’s Will,  there is harmony and all are satisfied with your efforts.

You will continue to meet again and again, beloved souls, on your journeys, your efforts, your gatherings, your prayers, your times of conversation. You will meet and support one another. There is much that awaits each of you on that path of service, of growing in the Love of God, awakening and utilizing the gifts that you each have, each unique in their own way, in service.

May you be receptive and willing and open to God’s plan for each of you. Listen with each day. Listen with the ears of your soul. See with the eyes of your soul. Know with the very nature of your soul, what is to come. May God bless you upon that journey, beloveds. May you indeed come to know your true selves, awakened and alive, beautiful and sparkling with God’s Gift of Love within your souls.

I am with you my friends. I am Andrew and I am with you, as are many who walk upon this Path Divine as your angel friends and helpers, guides and gatekeepers, healers and teachers. We all walk together seeking the benefit for mankind, to grow and change and bring Light to this world. Blessed and beloved souls, you will find your way. You will know, truly know what God has in store for your life.

God bless you. God bless you. Andrew loves you. Many love you. God bless you.
