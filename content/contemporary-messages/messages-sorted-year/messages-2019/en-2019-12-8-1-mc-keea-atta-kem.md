Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

I am Keea Atta Kem and I wish to add some parting words as well. As dear Seretta Kem had indicated, this time that you have been together has given us a great opportunity to help in the development of your gifts, to assist God in awakening your souls and to play our part in the salvation of mankind. These many days that you have prayed together have set within you a deep rhythm, a daily practice of giving yourself to God, helping your souls to awaken.

As you are now each returning to your home and the busyness of your lives and the demands that are put upon you through living your material life, what I wish to share with you is a great importance of continuing, in giving yourselves to God each day in prayer to sit with God and allow the awakening to continue. If possible, continuing in this rhythm of sitting twice daily would help to speed up your awakening. For understand, it is only you who holds your awakening. God is always ready to meet you. So the importance lies in your choice, in your discipline, in your commitment to your own personal awakening.

We understand that you live in this Earth plane and you have these demands, but beloveds, there is nothing more important than your time with God. So as best you can, put these other distractions and demands that come upon you, in their place. Put everything behind your time with God. Let this be your priority. As you do so, the angels who have administered to you during this time that you have been on this beautiful island, nurturing and replenishing yourselves, we will also tend to you. Our commitment is to our beloved charges. We are always on the ready to serve you. So as you place God and your soulâ€™s connection with God as your priority, so we too can support that.

We, the Celestial angels shall ensure that your journeys home are safe and smooth, to the best of our ability and that the reuniting with your family members, our love, our harmony, there will be a great sense of happiness and peace upon your returning. Do your best to see, hear, and speak through the essence of your soul. Allow your soul to emanate its properties through you and many blessings will be given to you and through you.

We are with you, beloveds, closer than you know and understand. But we are with you in your awakening, in your changes, in your transition. May God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem, elated to serve the beautiful souls of Earth. God bless you.
