# The Emperor Has No Clothes

October 10<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Punalu’u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh 


I am here George Gurdjieff. I studied many traditions from many places. I tried to use the highest teachings that had affected my soul and though you may not know this, I prayed constantly. I saw that when I went to the West, people had no concept of real prayer and no real concept of God. They were utterly distracted by day to day living.

I had been awakened in Love. I could see the pervasive sleep in the world and I addressed these issues. I would say to a certain extent, not much has changed.  And as I said when on earth, if you could see the sleep of the leaders of this world you would be horrified. But if we only had even a few hundred awakened beings everything could change. You, my dear friends, are this promise. 

The emperor has no clothes. I said that then and I say now, those who receive the Essence of the Creator will obtain immortality. You my friend understand this. I am so pleased to present this through this instrument today. I’ve been waiting a long time to speak and I wish you to know that I am here to help you whenever you need as are many. If you could see the many you would be astounded. You are our promise. You are our hope in God’s Love. 

Thank you for allowing me this time with you. May God bless you all and change you. I am your brother and friend George Gurdjieff.
