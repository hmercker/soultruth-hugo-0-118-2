Faith Nyquist received by Al Fike

Oh, my beloved friends, how you continue to strive for the highest and greatest and most beautiful of outcomes as you serve humanity and serve God. How beautiful are your souls, my beloved friends, how beautiful are your souls. As you continue to awaken to your own beauty, your own Light, you will find that these challenges that come to you in life will be more readily resolved and that the wisdom of your soul will continue to inform your actions and help you to understand the complexities that you face in the human condition. All those who are close and all those who seek you out, a great strength emerges from you, beautiful souls. A great strength that will in time, enfold your mind, your material mind, with wisdom and peace. That those worries you carry, those insecurities and concerns, will fall away and be replaced with a true sense of self, a true sense of grace and joy.

May God bless you, my friends, my beautiful friends, my friends of Light, of Truth, of integrity, of knowledge, of healing, of love. So much you have to give to this world. So much you will give and so much is given to you in all the abundance and joy that God has for each of His blessed children. All that is needed is your opening and desire to His Touch and Blessings.

God bless you my beloved, beautiful friends. I am Faith and I love you dearly, so very dearly. God bless you. God bless you.
