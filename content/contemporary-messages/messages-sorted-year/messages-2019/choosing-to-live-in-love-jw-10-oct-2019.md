# Choosing to Live in God’s Love

October 10<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Punalu’u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


I am here, Care. Imagine, if you will, being in the state of love in every moment. Imagine the joy and the happiness that your heart feels when your soul is lifted in love, when you receive the Heavenly Father’s Love and you hold fast to His embrace. There is no force in the world that can take that away. We here live in the loving presence of our wonderful Creator. When we go and visit the Earth planes or spirits in the lower spheres, we are not disturbed by their condition. We have compassion and love for them. Whenever they are ready, we share this with them and the Truth of God's Love. 

So I ask you to remember, remember this bliss, this Love that can be yours when you let go and you truly let God bless you. If you walk in His Light and His Love, if you make that your journey, your practice, if you stay in God’s Love, the world cannot harm you. You will not be distracted or in any way affected by the negativity of the lower ones. So given a choice whether to choose to be loved or not, choose love. You won’t be disappointed. 

I went through much in my Earth time that could be considered tragedy, negative and abusive. It was at times very difficult and I was not perfect. But the more difficult things became, the harder I prayed until always there was a loving and peaceful resolution in every case. Though we cannot change the will of others because God has given all this wonderful gift, we can love them. We need not be pulled into any place that is not of love. I prayed hard. As this one knows, often if not constantly, what was the result? Miracles, blessings and healings.  

Yes, I saw my own passing over. I spoke of it. This made it easier for those in my family and for my loving husband to accept my passing over. This love continues and I embrace all. I make no judgment on your choices, but only suggest whatever you choose, whatever you do, do it with love with all your heart and hopefully in God’s Love if you so choose and you will never be disappointed. Everything will be blessed. Go in peace.

I give you my love and my blessing in all that you do. I am Care.
