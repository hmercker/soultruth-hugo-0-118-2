# Consider What You Draw to Yourselves

April 14<sup>th</sup>, 2019

First United Spiritualist Church, Burnaby, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike



God bless you brothers and sisters. In this sacred home of God, may you find the nurturance of your souls that you may be blessed and inspired, uplifted, and gifted with Love. Beloved souls, what you think and what you desire, how you comport yourselves in your lives, your actions, your demeanor, draws to you those influences and energies that are part of this world and part of God’s world. If you seek for the highest, beloved souls, you will receive such blessings. 

If you come to this church and pray and open yourselves to light and then resume a life that is not of light, you will not receive these high blessings. It requires your dedication and discipline in your prayers and thoughts and actions, for this is a law. The law of attraction works, beloved souls, in every moment of every day. So consider your lives, consider your actions and consider what you draw to yourselves. For a life of joy is built on love, is built on light and higher thoughts. We wish to encourage you to walk in this light, to be a person of light and love in the world. If your decision is to do so, if your actions reflect this, then you will have the accompaniment of the angels with you. For indeed the law of attraction works in this way. 

I know in your life, in this world of yours, there are many distractions and many things that draw you away from yourself and from God and from light. I say to you, beloved souls, consider what is important in life. Consider that the light that you build within your souls and within your beings will reflect upon the life that you will eventually progress to in the world of spirit and that this light you may bring with you, this light will inform where you will be in our world. This is an important consideration. Be of light, beloved souls. Work together to support one another, to create light amongst you. God has drawn you together, beloveds. God will bless you all. God blesses you at this very moment. Accept this invitation of love. Accept God’s blessings. Accept the love and blessings from one another and you will create such a light amongst you, such a strength that no matter what may be in your world, you will have the strength and tenacity to deal with your world in a lightfilled way. 

Blessings to you, beloveds. God’s peace be with you, beloveds, and know that we from the Celestial Kingdom are there to help you and guide you and bless you. God sends His angels to help all those who are receptive, all those who desire this blessing. For the blessing of God’s Love, this Divine Essence, will ignite many, many blessings in your life and in your soul. May you come to know this and cherish this truth and seek out the blessings of God in all that you do, in all that you are. 

God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you in His Light. I am Mark and I am the guardian of this church and shall be here as long as this place stands. I will be with you supporting your efforts and being with you all as you journey in life and share this journey together in this place. God bless you, beloveds, thank you.
