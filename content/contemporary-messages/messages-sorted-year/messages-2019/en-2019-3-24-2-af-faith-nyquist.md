# God's Plan Will be Realized

Gibsons Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Faith Nyquist received by Al Fike

Now my beloveds, do you see how God works? That with patience and perseverence, with love, and the healings of your own hearts, many blessings can come and possibilities be realized. God is working within this place. God works and blesses everyone who enters into the doors.

You, my beloved daughter, are a powerful channel of His Love and Light.  Each and everyone who are part of this place feel your influence, your love, your light, and are uplifted. This ignites a greater understanding within their souls of God’s Will which inspires them to move forward in accordance to God’s plan. So you see, my beloved daughter, and my beloved friends, you continue to work towards the fullfillment of God’s plan in this place. As I have promised, the doors will open and have opened and will continue to open wider with faith and perseverence and patience and humility.

All will unfold as it should and I know that you all feel the joy of your beloved beautiful daughter who is experiencing the flow of God’s Will in her daily life. As she serves in love marking her progress, her light, deepening her understanding, and showing the way for those souls who in their hearts desire to serve God. She does so with such grace and gentleness, such wisdom and love that none can resist her light. None will impede her progress and service within these doors. In so doing, opportunities will flourish, possibilities will be realized, gifts and blessings will flow.

Much is coming. There is a plan as our dear and beloved Augustine has indicated. You all know this. There is a plan. The realization of God’s Will in this place will happen and indeed the doors will open wide. Many blessings will be given to the multitude of souls who are destined to come through these doors, come to learn truth, come to be comforted and healed and awakened and protected. So many lost souls, so many lost souls in need of this comfort, in need of love, you will each play a part in supporting this work that continues to unfold and be realized in accordance to God’s Will. Guidance is coming. All barriers will be broken and put aside. Love will flow freely, truth will flow freely, blessings, abundant blessings to all.

God bless you, my friends, I am Faith. I will continue to be with you, my daughter, and with my beloved friend and with all who are there. They are sensing the openings and the realizations of a dream to serve and awaken and be in the flow of God’s Will. Though their ideas and their language may be different, within the soul there is a knowing.

You, my daughter, will help to awaken their souls to these knowings and understandings. Your gifts, beloved daughter, just begin to open. You in time will be such a powerful instrument for God that as our beloved Augustine says, you will not recognize yourself. Yet, in this realization of your potentials, a deep and profound joy will be yours. Each day will be a gift as you have witnessed thus far. Yet these gifts that are coming will be so much more profound than what you have experienced so far.

My beloved daughter and my beloved friends, continue to pray for this place. Continue to be open to God’s promptings and be aware of what God desires and all will be well. All will be in harmony. All will be blessed. My beloveds, God bless you, God bless you deeply. I love you. I am Faith and I love you dearly. God bless you.
