My friends, I am Albert Einstein, and you may ask, why we are so interested in you. And I ask you, how many opportunities are there in your world to communicate with mortals? Very few indeed. So we work with what materials we have, my friends. I will tell you that you will feel guided to many souls that we will encourage you to connect and befriend. These souls will have the potential to bring forth information that we so very much desire to give to the world. Yes you may not be the direct conduits for these valuable pieces of truth and information to help your world in this way. You will be the intermediaries that will connect us with the precious souls that await.<sup>1</sup> 

The illustrious teacher, Augustine, speaks of God’s plan and I tell you we are a part of this overreaching plan that has many facets and avenues to be enacted and brought to your world. You see the entire higher spheres of spirit and of the Celestial Kingdom are engaged in this complex dance that God has put us to. We listen carefully to the orchestra, to what must be expressed in this beautiful ballet. 

It is easy for us, for we have the ears to hear, the eyes to see and the knowledge to give. It is not so easy for you who live in such a place that is inhibited and suppressed, but nonetheless we continue to forge ahead and work with you all. You continue to step forward in trusting faith, in a beautiful innocence and light that is refreshing to see in your world. May God bless you in your efforts and may God bless all of us in our efforts, that God’s Will indeed will be held in place and expressed in Love. May we continue to forge ahead on this path with each day. With each small effort that you make, there will be a great effort on our part to match your intentions and your work. 

We are closer than you think. We will all find our way and know great joy in this beautiful work, this expression of love for all humanity. We are all guided by God. We are all in the Light of God’s Touch and Love and care. This will be our saving grace, will it not? The power of Love to heal the world and the power of Love to add to the momentum for great change and harmony for your world? 

God bless you, my friends. God bless you and thank you for your efforts. Your friend Albert is with you in all that you do. I do pray for your success, the success of your work as do many thousands upon thousands on my side of life. Continue, my friends. Continue in your work and we shall continue in ours, working together as one. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.

**Note 1.** The unstated problem is that to receive scientific material, the medium needs a mind trained in science. We do not have such mediums in our movement.
