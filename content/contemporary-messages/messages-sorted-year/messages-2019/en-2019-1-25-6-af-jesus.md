God bless you. I am Jesus. And so you see, my beloved, beloved brothers and sisters, that there are many in the world of spirit and the Celestial Heavens who wish to work for the betterment of humanity. There are few who are willing to be the servants of light and truth. And so we are joyed when you come for this purpose and seek to serve in love. My blessings are with you, beloved souls, in these efforts. You will be blessed and protected. All will be in harmony with God’s Love and Truth. All will be within the flow of God’s Will. You have my blessings, beloved souls, and I am joyed with your efforts and willingness to serve in this way. I will be close. Many, many will be close, beloveds, and many blessings will flow and touch your souls deeply.

God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. My love is always with you. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. God bless you.
