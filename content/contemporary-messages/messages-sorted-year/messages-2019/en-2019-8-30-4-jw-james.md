# See the Wonderful Light with the Eyes of Your Soul

August 30<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

James received by Jimbeau Walsh

See with the eyes of your soul, this wonderful Light. As you open your hearts in celebration, as you release any thing, any wall you have built, any wounds you have kept, any hurts, allow this Circle of Light filled with God’s Love to dissolve those barriers for this is a day of transition. This is a day where we can begin to live in now, in love, if we choose to do so. There are many here to bless this Circle with each one. See with the eyes of your soul. Feel this Love. Let go as we walk into the future together in God’s Love. This transition is indeed simple but it is rarely quick. So you can always go to the simple place in your heart where God opens the door to your soul and His most Holy Spirit brings the Love that changes it from the mortal to the immortal.

This is your future, my dear friends. We are here as a part of this blessing today and in this Circle of Light and Love, rejoice with you. My love and blessings to all. May God bless you. I am James.
