# Invitation to many to pray with the Q&A Retreat

July 7<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Q&A Retreat Gibsons, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

I wish to convey a message through you to all who are part of your spiritual community and family. I wish to invite all who are able to join in prayer, a vigilance of prayer for this work that you are about to enter into, that this prayerful support will enhance and give vitality to your efforts. Though there are many who cannot be here in the flesh, we ask them to be here in spirit, in the spirit of love, in the spirit of prayer, in the spirit of support for these efforts. For we intend to uplift you all into higher realms of consciousness and of spirit. There will be visions and there will be great inspiration and revelation for each of you, beloved souls, even those of you who do not believe this is possible. Given the conditions that we wish to build amongst you, these faculties will blossom and open, for they will have found the right environment from which to do so. Those who will be praying with you from far away will also be touched by this loving condition. An angel will be with them.

The blessings and power of Love and Light that will be generated will reach far and wide in your world and deeply into the dark spheres and into those gray spheres above. There will be many thousands upon thousands of spirits who will be attending this gathering. Although, in your minds and your material reality, this may seem a very humble venture indeed, in a very humble place, small and intimate. In truth, it is the nexus of a very powerful source of blessings for many. And you have, each of you, whether you are conscious of this or not, will be a part of something very important that is powerfully blessed by God and you have willingly come to be a part of this. May the revelations that come to each one of you be deep, profound, to change and shift your thinking and understanding of Truth.

Much awaits, my beloved souls. May all those who are connected in this bond of Love, souls who continue to seek out the Father’s Love, join with you in these efforts. So, I ask you to set your times and abide by your commitments. This is not a casual venture, beloved souls. It requires your steadfastness and a strength to lay forth what is required to accomplish these tasks.

May God bless you accordingly, beloved souls, all of you involved, all the beautiful mortals who are seeking to bring love and light to this world of yours as God’s instruments and harbingers of Truth. Band together in unity and singleness of purpose, so that we may indeed bring greater light into this world, as God blesses us all in this mutual effort.

God bless you beloveds. It is your teacher Augustine and I indeed shall come and speak to you in your group. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
