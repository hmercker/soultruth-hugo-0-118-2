# You Walk the Higher Road

February 26<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Homosassa Springs, Florida. U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike



You have learned much in the last days together with your friends, but remember that you walk the higher road and must lead in love. Use your discernment, beloved souls, to teach and demonstrate your understanding of the Truths of God’s Love. As long as you are firm within your understanding and your light, you will forge an important and powerful relationship amongst you. 

Remember, it is easier to manifest spiritual gifts and efforts on these lower levels in conjunction with spirits than it is to bring in the high teachers, healers, lights of the Celestial Kingdom.<sup>1</sup> So though what comes through you is more gentle and more subtle, it is still of the highest and you must recognize that what each of you brings in this regard is powerful and instructive even to those you have met. With humility, not insistence, with clarity and with love you will share with your brothers and sisters and there will be a great feasting of spiritual knowledge and awakening. 

Yes there is much ahead. Many others to meet upon your journeys and we will be with you, beloved souls. We will be with you. Continue to draw in those who are meant to be within these Circles of Light and which you invite the souls to enter. You will be provided with the strength, energy, wisdom and love that you need in order to reach out to these many lost souls and many curious souls and many beautiful souls.

We are very pleased that you continue to reach out as you do, to seek out opportunities to teach, to love, to heal. This is doing God’s work and indeed God has much work for you all. You will meet again, beloved brothers and sisters, you will meet again. God continues to draw His children together, to bring them in light, in loving prayerful communion together. These blessings will continue to flow. You are guided, protected. You will be walking through many doors and much awaits.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Matthew. I am with you upon this journey. God bless you.

**Note 1** It is curious that I have never seen this point articulated in any channeled message, but it has caused me to wonder when, particularly those from the East, manifest amazing gifts, yet we hear that after death they have passed no higher than the Fourth Sphere. (G.C.)
