I am here Charles, your brother on the path of God’s love. I wish to say just a few things to you. If you can recall I had a particular way of dancing, in and around and over and up and down. All of the negativity, whether it was those Keystone Kops or others, I could dance around it, enjoy without reacting in negativity, though sometimes disappointment showed on my face. So I wish to tell the dear brother here that he certainly knows when he crosses the line, though he wishes to speak truth. This is good.

I would ask him and others, all of you, to do the dance. It’s a Divine comedy. It’s a Divine romance. The Love of the soul far outshines the natural affections. This I know now. Let your love shine. Dance in joy. Speak from your heart. Speak from your soul and don’t forget to wiggle your mustache a little bit. As you know, God has a wonderful sense of humor. How else could we be here? 

May God bless you. I love you. I am your brother and friend, Charles, Charlie Chaplin.
