Confucius received by Maureen Cardoso

Oh my dear and precious little birds who flock together, flock together over the wires, each one drawn to the Love. So you draw us, your Celestial friends, with you. I have the great pleasure to come and to speak and bring a message of love to each one of you, to support you on your journey of soul discovery, drawing in the great Essence of the Father’s Love into your soul and allowing the beautiful changes, the transformation and the awakening to come upon each one of you.

Beloved souls, drink deep of these Healing Waters. Let this be in the forefront of your mind with every task that you perform throughout your day. Let the awareness of your Heavenly Father be with you. For this is how you grow in strength, you grow in awareness, and you grow in your desire to bring forward God into your soul, building the great union between the soul of the Heavenly Creator and your soul, allowing this most gracious understanding, friendship, Love, guidance to build between you and your Heavenly Father. For, beloveds, yes you gather and you flock but in truth it is your individual path, your individual walk, your destined way in which God reveals Himself to you. It is through the sharing of your experiences you build with your Heavenly Father, how close you are, how deeply you understand and know the Soul of God, which is a continuous process.

But as you share this with others in this Truth, this unfolding of this Truth that happens within you, within your soul, you share this with others, it ignites in them inspiration, excitement, anticipation for what may too unfold for them by the grace of this Love touching upon their soul. So in your gentle ways, for God is gentle and the Truth of God’s Love will be gently expressed from you, as you share in such a way, it draws others towards you. They see this light which emanates from you. They recognize there is a sparkle, a light that is in your eyes that is evident. There is light in your soul. A great sparkle of light will come into the eyes of those souls who are filled with the Essence of the Creator, whose soul is being transformed by this Love and this union between they and God.

Always remember God, beloveds, with every breath. Inhale the Love of God and with every exhale, allow this Love of God to flow from you. For it is a continuous and eternal expression. Receive the Essence of God and allow the Essence of God to flow from you and through you. Touch many, beloveds, as God touches you. Allow this Love of God to touch many through you. Bring God into every task that is upon your day no matter the struggle, no matter how hard. When you remember God, you then are given that strength to move through the task that is challenging you, when you remember God. When you allow this Love of God to transform everything that you are, there is a great blessing, a great blessing that you carry within yourself and many great blessings that come through you.

So continue to gather, my friends. Our little birds, how we love to see you in such a way. How we love to witness your growing union with God and the transformation of your soul. For we see the love and we see the light that is growing within you each and every day. I bring the love of the Celestial angels. I bring their love, their support. How we watch you, beloveds. How we continue to watch you and watch over you. God bless each one of you mightily as you sit this time in prayer and silence, receiving the essence of the beloved Creator. I am Confucius. My love is always with you. God bless you. God bless you all.
