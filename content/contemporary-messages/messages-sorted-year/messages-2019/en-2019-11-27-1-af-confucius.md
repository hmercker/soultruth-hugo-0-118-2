Confucius received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, beloved souls. I am Confucius. The winds of change and opportunity continue to blow within your midst, beloved souls, blowing you hither and yon, bringing you into the bosoms of your loved ones and those who wish to pray with you in Circles of Light and Love. Seek out these invitations, beloveds. Know that God will guide you forth upon the wings of Love.

As you continue to pray with others in your home, in these Circles, in ways that bring you together in the Love and Light of God, know that God’s Hand rests upon you both, all who are here. All who are here, you are being blessed, beloved souls, carried, guided, blessed again and again. Allow God’s Grace to settle on you like a warm cloak of Love. Be assured that you will be guided forward, that doors will continue to open, and that gifts will continue to flow and strengthen and bring blessings to others.

Each of you are gifted souls. Each of you have much to give to the world. Consider your dedication to God. Allow that dedication and love for God to flow out to your brothers and sisters so that they too may feel the Grace that is given to you all and be uplifted and joyed by your efforts together, seeking the Truth of God, the Love of God through the blessings of God and all that God has to pour upon you. God eagerly does so for each of you.

So much is given and shall continue to flow, to awaken, and to show you the way to true peace and joy, Truth and Love. You have much to share, beloved souls. Do not restrict your gifts and opportunities to do so. For, as you continue to share, to be the ones to point to the Heavenly Father and say: *“His Love is for you. Open yourselves. Set your gaze to God and all will be given. All is given without judgement or restriction or penalties of any kind. All is given in the great blessing that is God’s Love for humanity and for you all.”*

Portals will continue to open. Blessings will continue to flow. Love will be your mantra, your daily prayer. It will be that which concerns your mind and your soul and consumes all in harmony and love. May the blessings of God continue to awaken you, beloved souls. Drink deep. Drink deep these Waters that you may ascend and be in the Light always.

God bless you. I am with you, as are many, in this great gift of God’s Touch upon you. God bless you. God bless you.
