Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. Your work continues, does it not, my friends? Your work continues in this Earth plane, to bring Light and Love, upliftment and peace, Truth and joy. Many are benefitting by your efforts. Many will benefit from your efforts and much is coming for you to do, beloved souls, as we have said so very often. So much work is needed in your world. So much love is needed in your world. So much truth must come to your world. Each of you continue to step forward in some way and touch the souls whom you encounter in your daily work and life. 

You are becoming known, my friends. You are becoming known, not only on this Earth plane, but in the planes of spirt you are known. For as you step forward in Light, as you continue to speak your words of truth, as you make great effort to reach out to others and as you create these Circles of Light, so you bring to yourselves some attention and recognition from those who are seeking, those who are drawn to you as your light continues to shine and brighten in the world. 

So these many spirits, which are a great number, much greater than those you reach in this Earth plane, continue to listen and to follow, to watch, to wonder and to seek. So you cause quite a stir in these circles. You cause a response when these spirits of the lower planes see the light that you create through your prayers, through drawing to you the angels of Heaven and so they are blessed. So they are blessed deeply and inspired greatly by the words that we speak through this instrument, by many things, the healings that are offered, the wisdom that you share with one another, your travels that are expressions of your love and compassion and the purposeful expressions of your soul. 

Many things, beloved souls, many things are having their effect as your instrumentality grows and your abilities to open and express your souls continue to grow. These spirits talk to other spirits. The word is conveyed one to another, drawing more and more to this Portal of Light here and elsewhere. So you begin to nurture great momentum that is indeed growing stronger and brighter. While these hundreds and even thousands of spirits are affected by your efforts, so they in turn are influencing many mortals and working with us to bring this Truth forward in the world and the momentum grows. You will find that many bright souls in your world will be drawn to you. You will be establishing relationships, working relationships, friendships and connections with many in this world who work to bring light and upliftment to your world. So the momentum grows. Step by step, day by day, minute by minute you continue to work, to pray, to contemplate, to reach out to many, to continue to be attuned to God’s Will. 

So this is how God’s Plan continues to unfold, in ways that at times are surprising to you. And in ways that bring unexpected results and experiences and individuals to you. But I tell you this plan that God has for the salvation of all is immense, is powerful in its momentum, and will continue to surprise you at every turn in many ways. Doors will open. Possibilities will be realized. Potentials will flower and blossom before you. Your gifts, beloveds, will awaken. Each time that you pray does that sense and knowing and experience of receiving God’s Love continue to intensify? Its power is growing within you. Its beauty and Light continues to open your eyes, your perceptions and your abilities to touch another soul. 

So much is waiting, beloved souls. So much will continue to unfold and awaken and bring Love and bring much joy to your hearts. Around you there will be harmony. No matter the challenges, no matter the conditions you are encountering for that moment, a wave of light will bring greater harmony to that condition. Your thoughts and how you respond to these conditions will bring greater harmony and love. Remember this, beloveds, that the world, the human condition, will always challenge you, beloveds. You must be strong and of good faith that God will resolve any problem, condition, difficulty and dilemma that is presented to you. Exercising your faith, beloveds, is important. 

Having trust in God’s Plan, His Will, the flow of that great wave of Light that is destined to bring greater harmony to your world, trust these things, beloved souls. Trust in your own soul. Trust in the power of Light to rectify all that is wrong and in disharmony. This is how God’s instruments work in the world, beloved souls. This is how you are to move in the world and to have faith in what must come and what will be manifest in the flow of God’s Will and Plan. So these things will show themselves and be expressed in light. 

Walk in the world as God’s instruments, beloved souls. Walk in the world without fear, knowing that God’s Hand is upon you, that you are indeed safe, that you will indeed be blessed and guided. Blessed and guided always, carrying you through that great maze of conditions that is your world, showing you the way, bringing you to places where you are meant to be, to be an active agent of God, to actualize the potentials of your soul that all is informed and flows in God’s Grace. There is much awaiting. 

Walk in your world with joy in your heart and great love for all. Seek to be a channel of God’s Love. Seek to absorb all that God has to give you, His great Essence flowing endlessly into that great reservoir that is your soul so that you will continue to grow and expand in this Love. Awaken, awaken so that all is made clear that deep and powerful wisdom will emerge from your conscious self and be given to council and assure your brothers and sisters to direct them to the Light of God, the Love of God, the power of God’s Touch that can heal and bring peace and balance and harmony to your world. So much awaits you, beloved souls. 

May you listen to your souls. Listen to the guidance that God continues to pour into you. Be aware. Have faith in that understanding that is your soul that knows God’s Will and you will find your way. You will be one that leads the way. You will be an instrument, a channel of Light, of Love, of healing, of peace, of all that is good, all that uplifts, all that helps to bring greater harmony to your brothers and sisters. God’s Love is great for you all, beloveds. You are His blessed children. You will find your way to the bosom of God and know the great comfort there. It is there always to give to you in times of strife and in times of joy, always there, beloveds. 

Allow God to embrace you and hold you in this Light and bless you in His Love. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. God bless you.
