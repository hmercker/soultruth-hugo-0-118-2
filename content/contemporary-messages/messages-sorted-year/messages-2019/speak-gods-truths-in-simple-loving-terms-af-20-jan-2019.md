Dear beloved souls, I am Augustine, your teacher. I lived many years ago in a country (Algeria) in North Africa. I was the bishop of Hippo. Beloved souls, we have connected each one of you within this circle of light although you are indeed spread across this globe. Your souls and the longings of your souls have brought you together. In this way, you create a Circle of Light in the world, a powerful Circle of Light that does indeed emanate love and light, blessings and peace. Thus we are able to utilize your efforts for the benefit of humanity. In this way God’s blessings flow through this great circle and increase the strength of this net of light that we are attempting to weave throughout your world. 

Beloved souls it is important that you speak the truth so that your world may have the opportunity to know the truth of God’s Love and how much God loves each soul in your world. To do so in simple words is most effective. The more complex are your teachings and words and expressions in this regard, the more possibility there is for misinterpretation and misunderstanding. God’s truths are simple. They may be understood by any individual given that they are open and receptive to receiving these words but most importantly, you must accompany your words with love. You must glow and be in alignment with God, that your souls may shine with this Love, that your hearts may be full of love, that your mind may be in alignment with your soul so that the words that you do speak are of truth. In this way you will do a great service to your brothers and sisters to speak of this truth in loving terms, simple and powerful. Your very being will be the example of this truth. 

There is no need for great churches and edifices, tomes and volumes of books. No, my beloveds, to touch another soul as a channel of God’s Love is a great work. One which places another jewel in your crown as you move in this world and walk and live in this truth. You exemplify the truth and your light may be used to ignite the longing within another soul. As you pray together as you are in this moment, you are sending light forth into the world. It is indeed, as this instrument has told you, that which is igniting the desire for God within many souls. 

Yes it is important to speak the truth and to have the words of truth available to mankind. This we are assisting you in accomplishing this and your efforts continue in this regard. Many of you will be writing and expressing this truth, sharing with the world your experience, your understanding of God and the wonderment of His Love. Carry this forth, beloved souls, with wisdom and grace, love and joy. God will guide you to many souls who will indeed be curious and desirous of the truth. This will happen in many different ways and each day may bring an opportunity to in some way touch another soul. Pray for this, beloved souls, pray for this with each day that you may indeed be used as God’s instruments to touch and bless another soul. In this way you are a channel of love and so you do God’s work, and you are indeed blessed and uplifted in this light.

May God bless you with each day, beloved souls. May His Love pour into your soul. May your longings be intense. May the opening within you be wide and receptive to the Touch of God and you will come to know such deep joy, such wonderment in your prayers and times with God that this will be the centre and heart of your life and give meaning to all that you do.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Augustine and my love is with you. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. Augustine loves you and God loves you beyond measure. God bless you.
