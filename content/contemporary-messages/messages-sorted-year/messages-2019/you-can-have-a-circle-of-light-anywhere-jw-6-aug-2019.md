I am here, Francis. What a beautiful Circle of Light you have here. We come here when we feel the longing of every soul reaching to the Heavenly Father, this draws us to you and we come to be in prayer with you, each one of you opening like a rose to the Creator’s Love. I come to not only wish you a great blessing in this Love but to tell you this is all you need, this simple gift of God’s Love directing you always on the path of Light and Truth and Love.  

Be in this state of Grace, this state of Holy Communion with the Heavenly Father, and let your soul perceptions lead you so that there be no doubt which way to go and what choices to make.  This what I did with my friends in Assisi as we flowed in the Father’s Love. We had almost no cares for anything else. Often we forgot to eat. We imbibed the fruit of the Father’s Love in our souls and we played and we sang. This was our church. 

My friends, you can do this anywhere. I would say it’s easier in nature but this place here, there is much light in this place. There have been many prayers said here. We can feel it. So we are here to support you and I say to you, give not a thought to doubt, negativity, weighing this or that. Let your soul truly be the centre of your lives, that God may open your soul to a radiant flowing of His Love. This is the gift.

I am grateful to be here with you all and to have this one allow me to come through though he is reluctant. I am Francis. I love you all. May God’s Love be with you all and may this Circle of Light expand throughout the Earth. You have drawn many into this Circle, visible and invisible. We are here. We love you. God loves you. I am Francis.
