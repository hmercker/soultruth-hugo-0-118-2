# Use the Gift of Free Will to Pray for Healing

June 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2019

Jimbeau Tour, Island of Guernsey, UK

Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you, beloved souls. I am here with you. My name is Lotus Blossom. I guide this dear instrument for she has a gift of healing and I am one of her healing guides that resides in the Celestial Heavens. I wish to let you know that as you have sat here open to this great gift of Love asking for God to send his administration of healing angels to the dear sister, we come in response.

Please call upon me in your prayers while you sit here each day that you come into this beautiful healing chapel to dedicate your heart and your time calling forth your healing for the dear one. I will assist you and I will assist her. I will be with her. I will do my best to work through the medical professions that will administer to her. If she is open, she may also call upon me for this gift of healing to come to her. But it must be remembered that the gift of free will is something that no one, not even God, can interfere with. If she is open and willing to receive the healing, so shall it may come. It is my promise that I will be with her and I will also be with you, the one who prays for her.

My name is Lotus Blossom and I stand with you now, in the center of your Circle bringing the gift of healing to each one. For it is true each one of the children of Earth are in pain and suffering. If they should only ask, healing may come.

God bless you, my friends. I am Lotus Blossom. I reside in the Celestial Heavens and bring my healing gift to you. God bless you.
