Faith Nyquist received by Maureen Cardoso

Yes, my dear, it is Faith. You have felt my promptings, my promptings for you to sit in prayer. For I wish to share a message and acknowledge the efforts, your efforts since your time at the Healing Center. Is it not a most glorious way to live when you can hear the guidance of God and you choose to follow the guidance? For when doing so, there are great potentials that can unfold, blessings that come, awakenings to be experienced, and the joy of walking attuned to one’s soul. Since you have arrived and made your daily visits to the Healing Center, you have seen and experienced first-hand the joy of walking with guidance. It too has been our joy to walk with you as you have been received with love, openness, kindness and been given the opportunity to share what it is that you know and these deep teachings and prayer practice of the Divine Love.

The dear soul who has recently joined in effort with those others to bring Light into the Healing Center, she is indeed very special and has been chosen and guided into this position. You have seen with your own eyes how she touches many, how she has a heart for those who are downtrodden, and how she recognizes the pain in others. It has been through her journey, through her own pain, that she can deeply understand where these souls are coming from. As she has brought healing into her life and now walks as a different person, sharing the ways that she has been healed and her practices, is very important to have someone that is open to great diversity, accepting of all, and who can see the light within another. So you are first-hand witnessing the blessing that this dear soul is to this Healing Center. I shall say, my dear, that she too recognized the gift that you are, has been pleased to come to experience that which you share in the Divine Love prayer practice. As she has told you, the way in which you have been sharing has deeply touched her and it inspires her and she is open for your return and the return of your friends.

Your time in prayer at the sanctuary has been instrumental, instrumental in strengthening this portal, and instrumental in helping those who work in this center to recognize the need for this silent prayer, this silence, to open and receive the inflowing of God’s Love. You know, my dear, it is not so much in the words as it is in the action and the deed. For with your continued time sitting in the sanctuary as the others go about their business with the many changes that are occurring, your time in prayer, sitting in silence, is bringing great effect upon the center. You feel it.

You recognize the blessings that are also being brought to you through your efforts. For today when you sat in the sanctuary in the silence with the presence of God, there was a deeper knowing that came to you, a recognition of yourself and going past these physical aspects of one’s body, one’s mind, and the many labels that humans place upon themselves. Whether it be mother, father, Christian, Jew, Hindu, Sikh, man, woman, artist, architect, nurse, laborer, these many labels that are plastered upon each individual, you were able in your meditation this morning to go beyond all of that and recognize more deeply than ever before, you are soul. Because you have had a deeper knowing and understanding of that Truth, you then began to have clearer sight, seeing all those people, these new friends that you have made, your old friends, and your family, as souls. You could more readily see the light and the truth of who they are.

So, my dear, you have had another layer released from your material eyes where the eyes of your soul are awakening. With this awakening came a flood of possibilities, seeing yourself standing before others, standing in your truth of who you are as a soul, sharing these teachings of Divine Love with the clarity, with your eyes of the soul wide open, seeing and perceiving the souls before you. Let this gift continue to blossom and as this does, you will continue to see the world through the eyes of your soul and see with the vision of truth. My child, that is a powerful experience to walk the Earth with. Do you see the gift you have received by your experience and your willingness to follow the guidance of God? It is beautiful to watch your truth unfold and your awareness to align with your truth.

Now, my dear, you have spent time with the dear soul who knew me well while I was on Earth. I continue to be around her and she continues to carry and share the many things that I shared with her while upon my journey of spiritual teaching when walking the Earth plane. I thank you for your curiosity about my life and your sincere interest to know through her eyes more deeply about me and giving her the opportunity to share what she knows as Truth. She too is a dear soul, doing her best. Your presence at the center for her has been very calming, for she sees in your eyes the gentleness, the love, the peace, the acceptance, and the willingness to be a part of something that already exists within this building. This puts her at ease. You are correct in feeling me around the two of you. You are also correct with my desire to speak to this dear soul through you.

But as you know, we your Celestial friends will not push. We will not put one of our beloved workers in a position that would dampen and hinder the strong relations that have been reestablished by your presence. But should, my dear, an opportunity arise, when the two of you spend your day together and there is a time to be in prayer or an opening to talk more about the memory she carries of our time together, then do that and we see, we see, my dear, what she may be open to.

We are very pleased at what we see that is happening within the building and how well you have been received and we see that you two have deeply enjoyed being sent out on this mission. There will be more of these. We appreciate the flexibility that you have by guiding those souls in prayer. Yes, we have been giving you these whispering words and your dear soul has been speaking the language of love as the meditations have unfolded.

There is a few days left before you journey home and we will be with you. Many blessings have come to this center and you two have received many blessings. So, my precious daughter, may you continue to be blessed by God’s Love. May you continue to awaken your soul, to allow your soul to flower into its fullness, and to bring its beauty and sweet fragrance into the world.

I am your dear friend Faith and my love and my prayers remain with you. God bless you. My love is with you. I am Faith.
