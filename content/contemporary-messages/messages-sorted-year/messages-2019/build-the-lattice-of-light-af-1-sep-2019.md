# Continue to Build the Lattice of Light through your Travel

September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

I am glad to speak to you tonight and welcome the dear daughter back from her travels and welcome you all to this Circle of Light. My daughter (J), you have given in ways that you have not done so before. You have discovered gifts within yourself and given of yourselves with love, close to the bosom of God as you have travelled and been to many places, embracing many beautiful souls who have benefited greatly by your efforts.  

So it will be, as you continue on this great sojourn of soul awakening and bringing truth to the world as a channel of God’s Love. So you will travel. God will beckon you here and there to many places. As you are physically present in these places, so you will bring a powerful channel of Love. So God may use you in many ways that have direct blessings and results. This is important, beloved souls. For yes, there are many blessings that can be given while you are in various locations praying together. This you have seen demonstrated many times. This gift continues to grow. But the power of your presence - and when there are more than one - is great. It creates a great light that we may use to help many, to reach out to many souls. 

So we continue to beckon you forth. We continue to guide you upon various paths and journeys, seeking to inspire you in your efforts and awaken you to new gifts and new possibilities. As you exercise your light upon these journeys, so it opens doors so that new gifts and new potentials may be realized. It is important that you are known and that many meet you face to face, to build this awareness of who you are. Not that we wish for you to be famous, but we wish for you to have the opportunity to be connected, to form bonds with others, therefore, helping to grow and expand and strengthen the Lattice of Light in the world. 

So my beloved and beautiful friends, expect that you will travel once again, many more times, to many places. This is in the plan that continues to unfold in your lives as you continue to commit in deeper ways to God and to God’s Plan to be a clear and powerful channel of love. No we do not wish that you are so unsettled, that you do not feel you have a home, a place that is the centre of your life, this is not intended, but that you may go out into the world and return to be replenished and go again and again. Each time you return, you have been changed, a gift has been given and a gift flows through you to those whom you have met. 

Much is in store for each one who is willing to commit to this great work. As you grow within your soul, do not be surprised that you will be asked to make these efforts, to put aside your daily life and commit to something that is extraordinary and beautiful and powerful, filled with love, filled with adventure, filled with many souls who are eager to meet you. 

Yes there is much work to do, my beloved and beautiful friends, much work indeed. Each of you must do what you can to strengthen yourselves and be prepared for what is ahead. You must be strong, strong in the physical, clear within your minds and in harmony within your souls so that the Love of God may flow, the Will of God may be known and the expression of that which you are guided to do may come to be without great difficulty or obstacles. You must commit within yourselves to do what you can to be strong, to be clear within your minds, to be bright within your souls. With this commitment, with your efforts, all will flow beautifully and abundantly. What needs you may have will be met, beloved souls, they will be met. 

Seek to continue your efforts to grow in love, to develop what gifts God has given you, to be an open channel of His Love and to see and receive what may be given in guidance and accept God’s Will in your life.

May God bless you, beloved souls, deeply within your souls, powerfully within your lives, in giving the gift of physical well-being and harmony. These things, God wishes to give to each one of you. These things are available to you, given the right response to God, desire of soul, faith and to work towards those goals that will bring to you the conditions of which I speak so that you are ready and prepared for what God has in store for you as His channels and emissaries of Love. 

God bless you, beloved souls. May God keep you within His Light, His protection. May you truly come to know yourselves and all the wonderment that is your soul and continue to walk the Path of Light. We are with you. We are with you and our love is with you. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. God bless you.
