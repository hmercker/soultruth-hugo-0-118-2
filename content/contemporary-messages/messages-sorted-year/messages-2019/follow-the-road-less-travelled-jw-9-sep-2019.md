# Follow the Road Less Travelled, the Path of Divine Love

September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


I am here your sister and friend in God’s love, Care. My dear Jimbeau is very happy to be around this energy, this feminine energy in this room. But I want to address the words of the song that the dear sister sang.<sup>1</sup> I walked the path of Love when I was on Earth. I am still walking that path. Yes, it is a road less travelled but as you know, when you are in the Love of God, you are in the flow of things. You are lifted above the material world, even beyond a sense of space and time because everything falls into God’s time. Your worries fly out the door. Your heart opens. You feel the joy of not only the natural world which is indeed a blessing, but the door to Heaven opens and you are touched by the Grace of Love that showers from the Heavenly Father into your souls. The flow of this Love puts you in the flow the Father’s Love and time. You open your heart and your soul opens to the company of angels. Everything falls into perfect timing. 

I know that your lives are busy. There are so many options, so many distractions, and necessities, some here more than others. I was a mom. I had children so I encouraged them to be in the flow with me. I prayed with them and I still do. So as you open to God’s Love, be in the flow with the angels. See the light coming through into your world, the Holy Presence that touches each soul and awakens you.

Thank you for letting me share my Celestial guidance with you all. You are a beautiful group of souls and I am honored to be here with you. My love and light to all. God’s blessings to each one of you beautiful souls. I am Care.
