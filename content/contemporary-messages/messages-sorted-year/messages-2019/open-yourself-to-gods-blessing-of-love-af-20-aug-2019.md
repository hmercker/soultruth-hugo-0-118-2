Blessings to you, beloved souls, I am Confucius and I am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. I go to God in my heart and my soul with longing and desire for at-onement. I have dedicated myself to serve you, to help bring the conditions of Light to each of you who are desirous of the great blessing of God’s Love. 

Beloved souls, the power of God’s Touch is with you at this moment. He is emanating to each one of you His Love, bringing this Light into your midst, coming to uplift and heal and awaken you. Open yourselves to this Blessing. Open yourselves to all that God has to give to you. These moments together that God indeed has brought you to are precious indeed, are filled with great potentials and blessings. You have come together to know one another, to truly understand and share and commune together in this great journey of awakening your souls in Love. 

Carry yourselves in the Light, beloved souls, seek for the highest. Seek for God. Seek that His Love, the greatest of all gifts may come and touch you deeply within your souls. In this simple quest, this simple journey of coming to God. All great blessings and understandings and experiences of Light will come to your soul and to your recognition of the power of God’s Love. It will flow and engulf you in Light. It will carry you upon great journeys of understanding. It will heal your soul and transform it in Love. This is what your souls desire, and God will answer all of your prayers provided they are sincere and have the deep longing for at-onement. All will be answered and shown and given in Love.

I bless each of you, beloved souls. Feel the power of the Presence of God in your midst. Feel that God has gathered you together in a Circle of Light that carries you heavenward, carries you into the grace and peace and Love that is God’s Presence and Being in the universe. Feel your souls open to this Gift. Know that you are being guided and shown the way.
