# Bring Joy to All You Do

January 5<sup>th</sup>, 2019

FUSC Strategic Planning Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Maureen Cardoso

Ha, ha, ha. I think there needs to be a dusting of joy and sprinkling of sparkly dust upon you all. Bring joy into everything that you do. Though some of you may be feeling slightly overwhelmed, bring joy into that. Allow this love to splash everything that you do, for it is joy dear friends, joy that brings a smile to every face.

My love is with you always. When you feel a little tickling behind your ear that is me saying hello and reminding you to be joyful. God bless you. I love you all.
