# Speak the Truth With Love

August 28<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am delighted to see you all together again and to join you in this place, this Portal of Light. I wish to speak about the transitory nature of your world, birth and death, decay, beauty, blooming, richness, poverty, all thrown in to this life on Earth. When there is a crisis in one’s life, it tends to bring about an opening of the heart. Whether it be a prayer and a plea for healing or for a resolution of conflict between individuals or nations, crisis is built in to awaken. For those of you who have asked our Creator to awaken them, to transform their souls, change their hearts, when crisis appears for you, it is a reawakening call for you to be in touch with your soul.

I do wish to say, there is no harm in having opinions or critiquing others with love, only to remember to do so with love.  This is imperative. If you can picture the Master, the picture of him that’s shared around this world that you live in, with the Sacred Heart, often with a wound in it, and yet the Master had nothing but love for all. Even when he critiqued others, it was with the power of love.

So do not be afraid to speak the Truth, live the Truth. Share this with others who are so longing for it. Not only in this gathering coming in the next few days, but in your walk into the future. Now as many go out into this world bringing the Light and Love of God in their souls to those hungering, spiritual food is the most important. And yes, as the discussion was this morning between my brothers, it is important to feed the body. When the body is sustained then the heart can be open in gratitude and the soul touched in Love.

So you can see how these two things can complement one other and in fact are so necessary in this world. So let every conflict, every crisis touch your heart. Embrace those souls that come to you, especially in this blessed place, this Portal of Light with God’s Love streaming through to each soul.

I thank you for keeping this place  sacred in prayer. There are so many of us Celestials wishing to come through. As you know, we will be with you here whenever you open to us. I wish to say on behalf of all those here in this moment, we love you. God loves you. We are now in this Portal of Light together and together we shall move forward. Be not afraid. Have faith. Trust in God. Continue to pray.

I am your brother and friend, Yogananda, and I love you. May God continue to bless us all in His Love.
