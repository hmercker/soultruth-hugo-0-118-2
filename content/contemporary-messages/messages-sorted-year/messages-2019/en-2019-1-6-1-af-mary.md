January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mary received by Al Fike

I come to greet you. I am Mary. I wish to bring my blessings and my wishes to you, my beloved children, that God may indeed increase the love in your hearts in this coming year and that as you walk this Earth, may you express love, embrace your brothers and sisters in love, and bring greater light to your world, a world that hungers and thirsts for love. May you bring the waters to their lips and entice them to drink so that the thirst of their souls may be quenched, the desires of their hearts may know joy rather than pain and anguish, that the questions of their minds may be answered by the deep peace of God’s Touch upon them and that all may come in a great burst of light and blessings upon them.

Blessed are those who carry the Truth of the Father’s Love in the world and enact this Truth every moment and every breath they take. These are the children who will comfort the lost ones and bring greater light and understanding to the world. May you be those children, beloveds. May you come to know deep in your hearts that it is your destiny to bring the light of this Truth of Love to those you meet. It may be just a gesture, a word of kindness, a look of love but in this comes the truth that stirs the soul and embarks upon those questions of *“who am I?”* and *“am I loved?”*

God will answer these questions, beloved souls, as he pours His Grace upon each child, as the world continues to hunger and thirst for truth and love. Your efforts and prayers will help alleviate this great need in humanity. Walk with God, beloved souls, and be in His Light and Grace and much light and many blessings will pour upon your brothers and sisters as you seek to be God’s channels of love.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Mary and I am with you as well in your great journeys to God. God bless you and I love you. God bless you.
