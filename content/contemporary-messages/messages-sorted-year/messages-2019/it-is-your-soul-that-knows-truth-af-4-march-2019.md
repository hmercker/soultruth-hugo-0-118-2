I am Lotus Blossom. I lived in what you call China many years ago. I come with my light and my love and my gift of healing for you, beloved souls.
There are many ideas amongst you, many experiences and beliefs, but much of what is in your mind is the result of how you have pieced together these experiences that are of the spiritual nature and come to your own conclusions and ideas as to what this is. But I tell you, beloved souls, it is not the mind that truly knows, it is the soul. It is that deeper place and within that place there is a sense of knowing, feeling that truth is coming, that you will find your way in light and that you are being guided thus on your own particular journey in light to truth. 

Remember that God is with every soul and God will not forsake any soul. It is for you to ask, to wonder, to pray, to open yourself to this blessing. In your sincere prayers, putting aside your thoughts and ideas for the moment and receiving what may come from God is a new awakening, a dawning of truth within that deeper place.

It is like a diamond within you, beloveds, that God chips away revealing facets and light within you that you did not realize existed. Be open to this Master Jeweler who brings the dazzling light within opening to your consciousness, open and beguiling in its beauty. Yes, your soul, your soul, beloveds, this precious thing within you, may you allow it to be alive, to sparkle in all its facets and light, all its beauty and colors. This will be your guiding light, beloveds. The truth that you seek will come from this source, your source that is a gift to each individual, your soul.

Allow this gift of love to awaken the light within that this may be the strength, the truth, the glory, and the joy that will come as you discover you own soul. As God continues to nourish your soul with His Love, awakenings and new beginnings, beautiful awareness and joy, as deep wisdom will come in this way. Put aside that which of the mind and delve deeper within yourselves and you will find the treasure trove of light.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Lotus Blossom and I love you. I will assist you on this journey. If you allow me to do so, I will come and help you to awaken. God bless you.
