# Blessed Are the Children

September 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

(song) Blessed are the children, blessed are the children in love, blessed are the children, blessed are the children, blessed are the children in love.
Beloveds, when you sit in such Circles and are awakened in this Light, so, you bless many in this effort to create Light in the world. And so, blessed are the children, beloveds. As you continue to pray and are in the flow of God’s Love, you bring this blessing forth, not only for yourselves but for many. So you are blessed and you are God’s children in Love.

May God bless you always and keep you in His Love. I am Goldie and I love you. God bless you.
