Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

…join you, I am Keea. My message today is one of encouragement, encouraging each of you as you are guided to step out onto the world, sharing this message of love, the Truths of God, the way His Divine Love awakens the soul, is freely available for all. We have observed those of you who have had a continued presence in the church that contains a Portal of Light and where these openings and offerings of sharing the teachings of Divine Love have been presented before you. When you stand before many souls who long to understand and know who they are and know their Creator in a very deep way, it is a beautiful plan that is unfolding for the teachings of Divine Love have been present in this place where people gather for spiritual teachings.

For some time now, know it is in your presence that mankind continues to struggle and awaken that these opportunities continue to be given to you to share this message. We have observed conversations and the dear souls presenting what could sound as though opinions concerns about your message, your message that you share, the truth that you share, that it is always toward God and the message of Divine Love. To some degree you are making consideration in your way of teaching and how to please and meet these concerns of others. For you teach love and you teach compassion and you teach understanding and this is what you carry within you. So it is understandable that you will take these concerns voiced to you to heart. Yet what I wish to relay to those of you who share these teachings and also, beloveds, those of you who in future time will have the great opportunity of presenting the teachings of Truth, to remain steady, to remain true, to remain humble and sincere to the teachings of Truth in God’s message of Love.

For this is what is missing in the world, beloveds. This great message of God’s Love is not widespread upon your Earth. You are pioneering, walking this Earth with the great message sown into your soul, with the desire to bring this message of Truth to your brothers and sisters that mankind can waken and these changes may happen on a deep level within each individual. For this is how harmony will arise in your world.

Beloveds, your training, your curriculum, your message is Divine Love. Your message of Truth is to be shared and each of you do a beautiful job as you stand before others carrying perhaps the concerns and opinions, not wanting to ruffle the feathers. But it is important that you stay true to who you are and allow others to stay true to who they are. For you do not ask others to teach the message that you carry. You simply allow others to share their message of truth that they carry at this time in their lives. So honor yourselves, beloveds, and honor the teaching of Truth and Divine Love. Keep these beautiful souls who share their opinions, keep them in thoughts of love. Raise them up in Light to God. Invite God to bless all with the great harmony, a harmony and respect, one for the other. For each soul’s message that is shared is important to be shared.

As you remain steadfast and true to the teachings that are in your soul, great harmony, great peace resides within you. Where you walk, beloveds, is to be guided by God and God is guiding you, guiding you to speak Truth. So my message to you, each one filled with God’s Love and Light, is to remain true to that which you teach, to remain true to sharing that which you know and all will be well. Keep yourselves alit with the Love of God and allow God to bless all around you and great harmony will unfold as you are sharing before others the message that is sown in your soul. The wisdom, the truth, the compassion, the love, the acceptance that is sown in your soul is what is to be shared and taught. For when you teach from the knowing of your soul, the message touches those before you.

You are beautiful students, eager, moving in great anticipation of love. Much is coming before each one of you. There will be challenges set before you. Those who to some degree feel uncomfortable with your message, they can resist to some degree but beloved, allow the power of God’s Love to transcend all that is in harmonia.

My love is with each one of you. I thank you for hearing my message and to continue to walk in Love and allow Love to transform your soul into great Light, into great teachers of Truth. Continue forward, dear students. I am Keea Atta Kem. My love is with each one of you walking this Path Divine, desiring to awaken, and sharing the message of Truth, walking with God. God bless you. My love is with you. I am Keea. God bless you.
