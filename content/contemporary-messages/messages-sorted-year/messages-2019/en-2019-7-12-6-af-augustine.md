# Thank You for Your Efforts

July 12<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Q&A Retreat Gibsons, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloveds, I am Augustine. I have come to thank you for your efforts in these circles. We have worked together to bring a great light to this world. We continue to work with each one of you to assist you in your efforts to bring light within your souls, to assist you in your efforts of service for humanity. We will continue to work with each one of you provided your motivations and the desires of your soul are in harmony with the Laws of Love, that you yearn within you for this great gift of love. This will insure that you grow in this great light and awaken within your soul as His blessing of Love accumulates within you. Take the words that we have spoken and the messages that have been given to your hearts and contemplate what we have said. It is a gift for you and all who wish to read and take to their hearts what has been given.

May God bless you on your journeys, beloveds. May we meet again to speak of love and the truth and power of love so that you may truly know the great blessing that God wishes to give to all. I thank you my beloved friends, I thank you for your presence, your love, your soulful desires and your efforts to be together in this way. You have been blessed, beloved souls, you have been blessed. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
