# Encouragement for Divine Love Mediumship Development Retreat

September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2019

FUSC Mediumship Class, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Charlie Chaplin received by Jimbeau Walsh

I came when you mentioned me earlier, to see what was up. Now I am here with you in this prayerful abode, which reminds me of my place in Ireland where I would go for refuge from the world to be alone in my thoughts, to have guidance. The difference being you all are all praying to the Creator to receive Divine Love and angelic guidance. I could not have dreamed of such a thing though I did have wonderful spirits guiding me because in my heart, I wished for the world to be a better place. I wished for the hearts that were breaking to indeed smile, and find love. These themes ran through my films.

I am aware that you have some important days ahead and so I wish to offer my encouragement and remind you to bring a sense of humour to the truths that you will convey to those who come, their souls yearning, their hearts breaking open. I tell you, you will be a wonderful blessing to all those who come. Have no fear, no doubt, that what you carry is true and full of Divine Love.

I am progressing now in realms of light that I could not have imagined and I see you as precious gemstones being polished. I am drawn to this on my journey which is, in a way, between two worlds. One from which I came and now one to which I go and live.

You are all so blessed to have the company of angels with you. I thank you for allowing me to share my heart with you. This one, who I feel as if a brother to me, thank you. My love to you. May God Bless us all.

I am Charles.
