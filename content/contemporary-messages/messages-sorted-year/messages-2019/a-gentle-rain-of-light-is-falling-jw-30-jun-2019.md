# A Gentle Rain of Light is Falling to Earth

June 30<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


I am drawn by the light and the love and the deep intentions of this beautiful gathering to be open to the Father’s Love. If you could see this from where I am you would see it as a gentle rain of Light falling to the Earth, illuminating this place. Imagine if the entire Earth were open to receiving this gentle flow of Light and Love from the Father. In this moment you are being blessed with it. I feel the intention of each one of you to serve, to bring the truth to this world. I would say there are many avenues with which to do this. So many of you, in fact each one of you do this in small ways, in big ways and in many ways. 

I encourage you to reach out to others, whatever their beliefs, whatever their religion, whatever dogma they follow, to reach out and offer these Circles of Light, these prayers and meditations so they too may feel their soul open to God’s Love and this showering of Light and Love that you feel. It is our desire to see the whole world illuminated and changed, redeemed, transformed in the Father’s Love. 

I wish to thank each one of you for the work you do, for allowing the longings in your souls to let the Father open them up to the inflowing of His Love. You are all so blessed and I am blessed to be with you. I encourage you, keep praying. You will see the transformation of this world. 

I am Yogananda and I love each one of you. May God bless you and continue to shower His Love upon you, each one. May the world be blessed in God’s Love.
