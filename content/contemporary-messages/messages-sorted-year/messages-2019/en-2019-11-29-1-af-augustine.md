November 29<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Waianae, Oahu, HI, USA

Augustine received by Al Fike

Yes, we are very pleased that you have gathered together once more, that you have heard God’s call again to come together in this Light that is created by your longing souls and our efforts and God’s Touch upon us all. In this time together, our hope is that many of your gifts may be encouraged to open, that you may have experiences, a sense of God in a conscious way, an infilling into your souls that is great and abundant, a healing and upliftment for each of you. For, in the coming months and years, you will be called upon to assist your brothers and sisters, to bring greater light and wisdom and love into their lives. So, you must be in a condition, a light. You must carry the wisdom and the knowings of your soul in relationship with God so that you are prepared, you are strong in Light and that you will walk this road in great faith and with a deep awareness of your Creator.

May the Father's Love infill your soul, beloved and beautiful friends. As you come together in this way, may the blessings from heaven come to you in this worldly plane and feel all the benefits, all the gifts, all the blessings that God wishes to bestow upon you, beloved souls. That you may continue to awaken, that you may continue to shift and change within yourselves towards greater Light and Truth and Love.

The angels are with you. Many angels gather around you with a deep desire to assist you in your healing and awakening as you journey towards God. So God desires that all good and beloved and blessed friends and blessings may be with you. Angels of heaven, angels of heaven are by your side, beloved souls.

Blessings to you. Love to you. Peace to you. Upliftment and healing to you all. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls, keep you in His Light. Augustine loves you. God bless you.
