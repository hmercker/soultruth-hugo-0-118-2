# We Protect You When You Travel

September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Joseph received by Jimbeau Walsh

I was here when James spoke. I wish to tell you that you are all precious cargo. On the subject of travel, we are in fact often with you but since we cannot be in two places at once, we do indeed have, as you say, charges to protect you. Only requirement on your end is that you stay in the flow of God’s Love. In this way, we can assist you more easily. As you know, when things are in God’s time, they are not always the same as what your expectations are yet when you review them you say: “Oh my; didn’t that work out just perfectly? Though we were delayed or sent another way. Yes, this is us working with you. Mary and Martha and some of the women followed the sisters and were with them in Africa. James and I and Peter, Augustine and others are here for this group.

When my son left the Earth, I travelled and I was protected. I was so moved by the events from Pentecost on that I became a disciple and I taught the Truths of Divine Love, the Truths that my son spoke to the world. As you know, so many have been lost or changed into something else, but you, however, have access to the Truth. I made it to the British Isles where I surrendered my body. There are legends about me there that in fact, some of them are true.

This was the establishment of what became Christianity. You represent its essence, its beginnings, so you have our support. We are very enthusiastic about your travels, about these Circles, so we come. When we cannot be here, yes, we send others, because we work in consort always. This is what you would call “working behind the scenes” and you don’t always need to know what it is, just trust, have faith, and know we are with you.

On behalf of my friends here in the Celestial Kingdom and my son, my Mary, and others, we send our love and support. We shall be with you in your travels. We shall protect you and support your efforts. We have great love for all of you. Please know that I love you, but above all God loves you all. May you each receive a great inflowing of our Heavenly Father’s Love, in this beautiful Circle of Light.

I am your brother and friend in the Divine Love. I am Joseph. I bid you farewell.
