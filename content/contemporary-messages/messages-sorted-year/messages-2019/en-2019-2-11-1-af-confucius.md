# You Cannot Imagine What is Coming

February 11<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Confucius received by Al Fike

May the power of God’s Love continue to awaken your soul, beloveds, and carry you into the light, into the beautiful light of God’s Presence. I come to bless the two beloved instruments who will travel and carry the message to the eager souls and to tell them that what they do is merely a shadow of what is to come in terms of the work that is waiting and the efforts that are needed by all of you beloved souls to bring bounteous love to this world, wisdom and light to this world.

You cannot imagine, beloved souls, what is coming. It’s beyond the perceptions of your mind and we shield your souls, beloveds, so that you are not distracted by these conditions and situations that are coming. Allow yourself to be within the flow of the Father’s Love, to allow the great blessing of His Love to continue to awaken you and strengthen you. That you continue to pray and allow God to place His Blessing of Love within you.

More insights and awakenings come. There is a great blessing for each of you beloved souls, a great awakening that awaits. You will find yourself in different perceptions of the world and your lives and yourselves, that as your souls awaken so the conscious perceptions of life, to adjust and conform to this new way of the understanding of the soul. You must be patient, have great forbearance as your soul continues to awaken and your minds adjust to this new way of being, this new reality that comes.

In this way, through your deep perceptions and understanding, you will lead others to this place, this beautiful place where your souls are truly and consciously connected with God. You come to see from that perspective of the divine. God’s Touch upon you awakens and lifts the veil from you and the ignorance and the misconceptions that you carry within your mind will be pushed aside in love. The scales will fall from your eyes.

You will find yourself worthy of all that God wishes to give you, joyous in this acceptance of God’s blessings, strengthened by the wisdom that comes with love, able to walk in light always, and allow this light to touch everything on your path as God creates a beautiful journey in service and continued deepening of your soul perceptions as love continues to flow. It shall flow in ever greater measure as you are attuned and awakened to this gift and all its possibilities of beauty and depth of healing, bringing harmony to your soul, allowing your mind and soul to merge into one being awakened in truth and love, carried in light and joy.

Beloved and beautiful souls, you continue to awaken. You continue upon that journey and we shall indeed be with you. Be at peace, beloved souls. Continue to listen to the promptings that God puts within your soul and to respond appropriately to your guidance and to the many blessings that come to pave the way.

God bless you, beloveds. God bless you on your journeys, both within and around the world. May God bless you, carry you, beloveds. God bless you.
