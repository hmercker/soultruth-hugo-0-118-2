Beloved souls, I am Jesus. Has it not become evident to you that the forces of heaven are focused upon you and all who wish to carry light and love in this world? For it is time that all may be transformed and blessed and awakened in Love. You carry this Truth within your soul, beloveds. You carry the desire and the knowing that love will indeed be the power that will save all humanity from all the great calamities that humanity creates in its stead. 

Seek the truth. Seek it with all your hearts and souls and minds and embrace the Truth within you. Summon the powers of God’s Blessings to carry you forward in the world and be a channel of love for all you meet. Summon the power of all the angels to guide you upon your path and keep you safe. May you be guided in accordance to the Will of God. Summon the Holy Spirit into your souls to awaken all the aspects and faculties and powers of your soul that you may walk in the world as an example, as an expression of the highest possibilities and Truth that lay within your soul that is ignited with the Father’s Love. 

Awaken, my beloved brothers and sisters. Claim the Truth and walk in the Truth with every moment and breath and you will truly know the great blessings and Hand of God upon you that will continue to awaken and empower you in Love and Truth. 

I walk with you, beloved souls. I am Jesus and my love for you is great. I walk with you in love. God bless you.
