I am Luke and I join you along with a band of Celestial angels who have come down from a very great distance to be with you in your Circle of Light, bringing our love and our light in condition into your Circle and into your midst. For when souls on Earth gather together such as you have, praying, yearning and longing from their hearts and from their souls for a connection with the Creator, with their Beloved, to build a great foundation in relationship based on love and truth, this dear friends, attracts us. We stand with you, inviting this great Essence of the beloved Creator into our souls. For we too, my dear friends, pray as you do for this great Essence of the Love of God to bless and expand our souls, to further the awakening of great wisdom and teachings to come to us, for it is an eternal journey. 

The discovery of Truth is eternal. Wisdom is brought by the Love of God into one’s soul. As the soul expands with this Love, knowledge, wisdom, truth, compassion, patience and empathy, all things are given dear children. All things are given. As you, through the great gift of your own free will, reach to your beloved Creator and that deep place within you which is your soul, with your heart longing to know this Love of God and awaken the soul, great peace, joy and healing comes to each one.

God loves all. Love, the Divine Love is the highest Gift available in all the universe. As you continue along this path, it awakens your soul, the gifts of the soul that are unique to you and your gifts, beloveds, are there to be used as instruments for God and blessing others. It also provides you a great opening with purity and sensitivity to know your Beloved, to know the inner workings of your soul, and to know God, to commune soul to Soul. It is the greatest effort that you can make at this time of your life while you are on Earth. For when you walk the Earth, there are many distractions, many possibilities. You are curious. The mind is very curious about many things. 

Yet, beloveds, it is the soul that remains for all eternity. When a soul is gifted by this Love, all things come, all things are understood, the mind of the soul awakens, and the material mind is a secondary measure in your life. This material mind was given to you to serve your soul. As your soul begins to expand and waken in you, it can then inform your material mind and great harmony can come between these two parts of your being. 

Beloved friends, as you sit in a Circle opening to God and yearning for this blessing of Love to touch you, we stand by you. We are here to help and assist and to serve you. Always reach to God, beloveds. We your angel friends are the agents that God sends in answer to your prayers for help for we come to influence you with thinking and help to guide you. We are here to serve you as you reach to God for this great blessing of His eternal Love. 

I thank you for hearing my words, and sharing your time together in this way with one another, with God and with your Celestial friends. God bless you, beloved souls, I am Luke. The love of the Celestial angels is with you all as is God's Love. God bless you.
