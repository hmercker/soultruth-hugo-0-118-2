# Be Thankful and Joyful

January 27<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Angels' Q&A Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

Oh, our friend is so serious. Such doom and gloom. Know that you are in the Light of Godâ€™s Love, my friends, and that your life has much joy in it, so many blessings, so much to be thankful for. I continue to be with you. My friend, I sung with you this morning as you awoke and my friend, I walked with you in the forest. And with all of you, I have touched you with joy and love and will continue with each day that you are together. I will bring a special blessing, an uplifting light, a joyful whisper in your ear, a tickle, a hug, a kiss, because I love you. I am with you. I love you. God bless you.
