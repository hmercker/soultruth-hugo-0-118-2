# Guidance in Articulating Questions During Retreat

July 11<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Q&A Retreat Gibsons, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

Beloved souls it is Keea and I wish to come and be with you and share a short message of guidance. There is not much time left together in this opportunity to answer your questions, your soulful questions related to the awakening of your soul. We observed you this morning as you gathered together with the focus upon formulating a question and honing that question into something where a deep and broad answer could be given, such as what you have just observed through our dear instrument. We ask, for these next times that you sit together, this same rhythm takes place. You gather and you come together as a group, formulating a question for when those in the group are in harmony with this question that is going to be put forward, this assists the clarity, not only the formulation of the question but the depth of the answer.

So as you gather these next few days forward, beloveds use the time you have dedicated gathering prior to your prayer beginning to focus upon this great project, being in your soul and allowing the mind to fall into that deep stillness that is within you. This we need of you, beloveds for it is important, this time together and we wish to make the most of that which we have left.

We are pleased with what has transpired and we anticipate your great questions of the soul will allow us to come to you and bring these deeper teachings that you are ready to hear. Some of you have been on this path of Divine Love for a great many years and your souls are ready to hear these answers. And those who are new to this practice, beloveds, there is much to read and these beloved souls can guide you. There is so much to reap upon this path of Divine Love, allowing the Essence of the Creator to bless you, to live within your soul and to begin the transformational awakening, this eternal journey.

May God bless each and every one of you. The Celestial Heavens applaud you for your great efforts and your dedication. I am Keea Atta Kem and my love is with each and every one of you. God bless you, beloveds.
