# The Angels Walk With You

June 24<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Jimbeau Tour, Island of Guernsey, UK

Augustine received by Maureen Cardoso

Beloved souls, it is your teacher Augustine with you. We are very pleased with how you have dedicated time in this healing chapel to pray, strengthening Light that flows, establishing greater healing energies, the healing Essence of Divine Love, to come into this place. A great work has been done while you have prayed together. You have assisted us in bringing forward a Light that has been established with great healing and energies of Love.

If you were able to see the difference, you too would be greatly pleased. We wish to let you know that your work has made measurable difference in this healing place. Isn’t it as we promised? We will continue to promise that you will meet many beautiful souls upon your journey.Surprisingly, you helped to assist to open the hearts of those who perhaps you are unexpected to have their hearts open to you. Yes, it is just a matter of overcoming fears, fears of the unknown, differences, fear of change, fear of being accepted.

You are witness to the very experience of that last night and also to the others you have come together with. Today will be more of the same, my friends, for God’s Hand is upon you, remember, guiding you. The angels walk with you, assisting and influencing and bringing their light and presence everywhere that you go. And this shall remain. Your souls are deeply blessed by the Essence of God. Changes continue to occur and greater harmony come into you and greater peace and joy being expressed. A state of contentment is gaining in you. The Love and your Light that resides within your soul emanates brightly.

We will continue to guide these two dear souls who have journeyed forward here as they return across the waters and as they continue in their travels. Have faith, beloved souls, have faith that your steps are guided. The angels walk with you. You are deeply loved. We have a great appreciation for you.

I am Augustine, your teacher, and my love is with you. God bless you on this day together. Be in love. Speak and walk with grace and allow joy to be expressed in the company that you shall share. God bless you. I am Augustine and my love is with you. God bless you.
