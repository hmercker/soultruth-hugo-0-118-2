Confucius received by Al Fike

I need to bring my blessings to you, beloved souls. Confucius is here. You assist us in bringing light to this world. We shall continue to work with you to help uplift humanity, bring truth and love so that this world may heal and harmony may come to all humanity and all creatures, all corners of this world. This is our goal. This is what God has asked us to work towards for it is Godâ€™s true desire that harmony and love shall reign upon this world, that all life may thrive and know the joy of its existence in this world and the next.

You are a part of this great plan for the healing of your world. Your prayers are important. Your thoughts and efforts bring them to the highest and greatest good for your brothers and sisters, for this world. You are needed, beloveds, so deeply needed in a world so bereft of love, so in need of light. Continue in your prayers and efforts to bring this to this world. Seek God and God shall bring through you many blessings, manifestations, healings, and joy.

It is all for the asking, beloveds. All you need do is have faith and God shall touch you deeply, uplift you, nourish your souls, bring knowledge to your minds, truth to your understanding, experiences of light and love. All for you, for every soul who but makes a small effort to reach, to receive, to allow, and to desire such gifts from the Source of all.

God bless you, beloved children of God. You are loved. You are truly loved.
