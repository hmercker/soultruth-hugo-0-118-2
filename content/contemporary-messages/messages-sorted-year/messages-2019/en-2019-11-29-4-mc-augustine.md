# God's' Love is the Highest Attainment in Eternity

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Waianae, Oahu, HI, USA

Augustine received by Maureen Cardoso

I am your teacher Augustine. Welcome. Welcome to this time together, this gathering that we have helped to orchestrate, bringing you all into a Circle of Light that will nourish and support your own gifts, your vitality, and the work that is ahead for each and every one of you this coming year for we have that said it will be a very busy year.

For some, there will be travel. For others, the travel may not be far. But no matter, each and every one will find themselves in situations and circumstances where the work is to some degree new. The arenas to some degree also new and people coming before you that you will be meeting for the first time. As you begin to come together, at this point, your Circle is not completely formulated, but as you few that are here together, you already feel to a certain degree, a sense of being uplifted simply by being in the company of others who are of like mind, who love God, who yearn for God’s Love in their souls, and a desire for their gifts to be in service to God.

It is a special gift, this union of you coming together. We are so pleased that all of you have made many efforts, beloveds. We have been with you in your times of arranging and working diligently, gathering family support so that you may be here with a sense of freedom and a sense of joy and a sense that you are being taken care of and all that you have left behind is also being taken care of.

You will bring a great Light into this neighborhood and community. Each of you see that this community is in need. By choosing this location, you bring a great service here by being in prayer and allowing the angels and God to come close with their Light and their Love, having this great Light and Love expand further out.

You can see that these waters nourish your body, the salt and the sand, the air, the sunrise, the sunset, the fragrance, the quietness of this area. Allow all of this to be absorbed, absorbed fully and completely by you. Give yourself this time, beloveds, for God has arranged each one of you to be here and wishes to nurture you, body, mind, and spirit. There shall be great joy amongst as you share these upcoming days together. The harmony will strengthen by being in prayer together continuing to receive the great Essence of the Creator and allowing this gift of His Love to deepen your bonds, to awaken your gifts more fully, and for great peace to come to each one of you.

We shall come and we shall speak. Yes, there is a sense that perhaps that there may be one of two of your sessions where, should you formulate questions that we may also come and answer these questions for you. For those of you who are gathering here have walked this path a great many years so your questions, to some degree, will reflect this. You are all eager, eager students to learn and to grow. You recognise and realise that this gift of God’s Love is the highest attainment available through eternity. You, beloved souls, understand this well. So we shall continue to work with you and support you and bring you our love.

Be of good cheer, much laughter and much love together. God bless each and every one of you. I am your teacher Augustine. My love is with you and the love of the Celestial Heavens shines down upon you, beloveds. God bless you.
