I am Jesus and I come because I feel the yearnings of your hearts. Each of you has a deep yearning to know your true selves, your soul. Each of you is seeking the journey towards that place within that is deep, where God and you may commune in harmony and love. Each of you continues to struggle with the material world in your own way. These difficulties in your life will fall away with the blessings of God upon you. You are not lost, beloveds. You are not lost. Merely you continue upon that journey of awakening, of knowing and of acknowledging that God indeed is with you. So you have been drawn to this little Circle of Light. You seek answers. You seek to know the way beyond your dilemmas, beyond your challenges to a place of deep healing, of deep knowledge, of peace, the peace that passes all understanding.

Beloved children, know that he whoever walks in light shall be blessed in light. Those who seek truth shall find truth. Those who open their hearts to God will find love, great and abiding love that will warm those places within you that feel alone and cold. You will find love that shall open those places that you do not realize are there but have great gifts to offer to your life and truth that will carry you far beyond the pale versions of truth that this Earth has to offer to a place where truth is immortal and powerful and awakening. For God will touch your soul, beloveds, in such powerful ways that you will be changed, as will your life.

This is what every soul seeks: the nourishment of the Holy Touch of God upon them, towards that place that will come in time, at-onement with God. Seek this gift of Love. Yearn for this gift of Love. In this yearning will come the answers. In your prayers will come the blessings. In the blessings will come great healing and peace and joy and true knowledge. It comes with the opening of those places deep within that are full of yearning and pain and a desire to truly know.

Beloved souls, each of you carry gifts, great potentials that are needed in this world True insight that will come and be expressed and will inspire many souls upon their journey of light.
