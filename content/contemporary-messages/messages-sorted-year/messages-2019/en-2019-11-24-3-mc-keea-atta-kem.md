Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

It has been a true gift to us, your Celestial teachers, to come to your gatherings that have been held in this wonderful sanctuary where there is a Portal of Light that allows God’s Energies to flow, healings to come forward, and draws forward your Celestial teachers. For when you desire to receive the Light of God’s Love, we are compelled to come forward and assist you.

Each of you have received much in the way of a great deal of Light within your souls over this time of being together, conversing, and being in prayer. For prayer is what draws God’s Love into your soul as you reach and yearn through your soul’s longing. Whether that be a verbal communication or a silent, soulful calling forward of God’s Love, the answers come.

This is something that we say time and time again as we serve in these Circles of Light, the many beautiful souls that gather. We encourage you. We beseech you to be in prayer, to give yourself to God. Allow God to give everything that has been designed to come to you. Allow God to give His beloved children all that He desires to give. Open your souls to the receiving of that which your Heavenly Father, the Holy One, desires to give.

You will find a depth of peace, contentedness, wisdom, knowledge, and understanding will come to you in great abundance. This is a form of prosperity, beloveds. When you behold the Love of God within your souls, there is no greater richness. There is no greater currency that you can receive or give. The many gifts that God has implanted within you shall be awakened. As these gifts are awakened, a brightness of Light, a depth of Love, and instrumental desire to be able to see the Light of another soul will be your gift. This Love of God within your soul will burn away anything and everything that is not in harmony with God and His Creation.

If you were able to carry the understanding that in every moment you may be in service to God, with every breath, there will be such a deep connection of your soul to God that your instrumentality will touch many. We understand this is a great challenge for the condition of your Earth is not in harmony with God’s Love and Laws but, beloveds, this is the great importance of you being that Light and of you awakening your soul in God’s Love.

As you come to a closing in your gathering of Light, I would like to impart to you the great importance of giving God time each day to nourish your soul and giving God time to heal the wounds that lay within you from your life’s experiences. When you allow God to bless you each day, drop by drop as this Love finds its home within your soul, healing comes. God does not intend for this to be a struggle. God intends to nurture you, to comfort you, and is always there for you.

Turn yourself towards God, beloveds. Turn your face toward God for this is the deepest relationship that you will ever nurture. As each of you have the strength within you and recognise that God is the One, there is a dynamic unfolding in your life. Many doors will open. Beauty will flow to you and through you. God will always replenish you and bring you great strength and vitality. So, if there is any one thing that we, your Celestial teachers, could impart to you through this time of gathering together is to receive this Love, to open yourself, and to know that you are worthy. God sees the beauty that He has created. This is all God sees in you. Allow yourself to come into your fullness, beloveds. Allow yourself to be awakened to all that you are.

I am Keea Atta Kem. I thank you for hearing my words and conveying my love to each one of you. It has been a great service of love, of joy, of passion. To the dear brother who shares his music, God bless you. You are deeply blessed and you touch many souls with your music, my son. God bless you all. My love is with you. I am Keea Atta Kem. God bless you.
