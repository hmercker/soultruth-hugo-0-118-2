# On Closing, We Have Accomplished So Much Amongst You

January 5<sup>th</sup>, 2019

FUSC Strategic Planning Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mark received by Al Fike

God bless you, I am Mark. We are pleased that we have accomplished so much amongst you, and together you have become unified and fulfilled your task. Now the true purpose begins as you venture out into the world to this place of light and healing and express your gifts and talents, to be responsible for that which you are endowed to do within this church. And yes, to rely upon your Heavenly Father to bless you and uphold you, that His Love may continue to flow into your souls and that your souls may continue to awaken in His Love.

There is much to be accomplished. Building a Centre of Light will employ your gifts, your dedication and your love. This we see is in abundance in all of you and will be reflected in this place. You will have us by your sides always beloved souls, and we will continue to guide you, to awaken you, to inspire you and to show you the way as time progresses.

Beloved souls, know that the work that you do will have far reaching consequences, and the work that you do will indeed enhance the light within your souls and that there are great blessings to come. God will indeed bless you mightily and carry you forth uplifted and bring many to your church who will support, contribute and add light. Those who are in need will be blessed. Beloved souls, may you come to know all the beauty within you and come to express all the Love that God has placed within your souls and be clear and mighty channels of His Love. Make purposeful efforts in Love to put love into action, as you say, in the world. May you indeed find great joy in all that you do.

We thank you beloved souls, and we love you. Great blessings upon you. We shall carry on, carrying the banner of service, love and commitment as a channel of God. God bless you. I am Mark, and I am with you. God bless you.
