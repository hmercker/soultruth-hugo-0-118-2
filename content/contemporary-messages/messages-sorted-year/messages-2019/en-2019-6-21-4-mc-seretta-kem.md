# Thanks for Listening to Guidance

June 21<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Jimbeau Tour, Island of Guernsey, UK

Seretta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

It is Seretta Kem. I wish to speak to the dear friends who have arrived in their new location where they will spend time in prayer with the dear soul who resides on this island. I was with you today while you were enjoying the company of the dear souls who welcomed you so generously and hospitably into their homes. Indeed, two beautiful souls. I am pleased that you have invited this dear woman to have a prayer with you. For yes, indeed, she did share many of her experiences and her connections with spirit and how she hears guidance, the voices of loved ones who have passed into spirit, and the visions that she has shared with you. We will speak through you to her tomorrow.

Are you alright, my dear son? I am sensing that it will bring great benefit to her to be guided to focus upon her soul and the development of her soul, awakening her soul by the gift of God’s great Divine Love. She indeed is a gifted soul yet requires a focus, requires someone who can give her direction and speak through their experience. It is not to say that she per se that she will be used by the Celestial Angels. Though what is important for this dear soul is that she can be given a solid foundation and practice of awakening her soul by God’s Love and finding herself as a channel for those in spirit. I thank you for inviting her for prayer and we will invite her to make time to pray together with the dear soul who wishes to have a Circle of Light in this healing chapel.

I thank you for listening to the promptings and the guidance and the influence that we continue to bring to each one of you. We will be with you tomorrow and the following days as you pray in this healing chapel, bringing this dynamic Light and Love of God into this Centre.

Our love is with you. I am Seretta Kem. God bless you.
