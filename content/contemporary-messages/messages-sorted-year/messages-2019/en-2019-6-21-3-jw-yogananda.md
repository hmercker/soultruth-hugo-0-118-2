# We Support Your Efforts in this Sanctuary

June 21<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Jimbeau Tour, Island of Guernsey, UK

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear friends, you come to this place that it may be a place of healing, a sanctuary, and your prayers will help establish this. For God’s Love is gentle but powerful and creates a magnetism, spiritual magnetism, that draws the hearts that are yearning for a connection, as it has drawn your hearts to this place, and your deepest desires have drawn God’s Love into your souls.

I am happy to see you in this beautiful place and support your wish that it become a place of healing, a sanctuary of Light and Love, a refuge. There cannot be too many of these places on the Earth and you have chosen well. Already, your prayers have brought a calm and a peace and an inflowing of our glorious Creator’s Love, a presence in this place that shall remain. It will be one of Light and Love.

So, I thank you for coming here and I am happy to join you as will many others, these next days. We just ask you to stay in your souls, connected with our Heavenly Father’s Soul and we shall be with you and support you. I love you. My love is with you. May God bless you. I am Yogananda.
