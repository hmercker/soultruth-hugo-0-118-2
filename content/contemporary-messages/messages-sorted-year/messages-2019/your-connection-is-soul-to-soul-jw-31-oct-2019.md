Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here in God’s great love, Care 

I am very delighted for each of you to be going on this journey. I feel your concerns and your hopes and aspirations. Of course, you know there will be many with you on this momentous venture for God’s Love to be brought through each of your souls and through the Hand of the Heavenly Father, to this land where you go.
   
The connection you have with each other is soul to soul. This is also your connection with God. Therefore, your connection with each other is in God and allows you to agree, disagree, all these things, because the Love of God transcends all. As Augustine said, there will be difficulties, but you will bring this Love from your souls and the support of each other, in soul, beyond the mind, beyond the words, this is what you bring. Indeed, this is your gift to the land where you go and to all. 

I wish to say, you will be a great blessing to the dear brother there who awaits, and all really. So, fear not. All is in God’s Hands. We will be there, and we shall give each one of you a sign to remind you of our presence. 

With all my love and blessings in the Father, I am Care.
