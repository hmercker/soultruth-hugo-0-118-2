It is Goldie. My dear friends, what a joy to see you praying together. I like how my name has been given to that little device you ride upon, my son. As I have said before, it brings me great joy to be with you and ride together. Now, this dear instrument is willing to allow me to sing through her. I would like to sing this song to you but I would also like you to join with me for I think you will like it. (singing) I’ve got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart, down in my heart, down in my heart. I’ve got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart, down in my heart today. I’ve got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart, down in my heart, down in my heart. I’ve got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart, down in my heart today.

Ah Michael. It is joy that I bring and joy that I see when I sing together. May God’s great blessing of joy continue to enliven your soul and allow that joy to be expressed in your life. God bless you. I am Goldie and I love you all dearly. God bless you.
