# Awaken and Seek the Truth and Love of God

September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Divine Love Mediumship Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

The deep resonance of your beloved souls reach God, my brothers and sisters. I come to be with you in your Circle of Light as you seek the Truth, as you continue to explore the natures of your souls, the awakening of your being. Know that the Heavenly hosts rejoice, that God smiles upon you and carries you upward into the light releasing the conditions of your world, giving to you sweet respite in Heaven, Heavenly Light and Love.

Seek to know the longings of your souls. Seek to know that God indeed loves you and you are precious, each soul precious to God and loved deeply. In this search, in your yearnings, in your discoveries, you will come to know God as a personal, loving Father who seeks to uplift and heal, to bring His Love to you through the workings of the Holy Spirit, which is the instrument of His conveyance of Love to your souls.

Awaken, beloved souls, to the great Light that is pouring upon you and the Love that God has for each one of you. Seek this Love. Drink It like a man in the desert needing water. These are Living Waters, Living Waters, the Essence of God. Awaken to this Gift and know that the awakening doors will open, understandings will come, and you will feel as close, close and protect you, and guide you on your journey.

*“Beloved Father, bless these children who seek you out and desire to know you. May you put the desire of your Love within their souls, may they open to this yearning within, beloved God, so all the powers of Heaven and Earth may come and bless these beloved children.”*

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Jesus, and I come to all souls who have that deep yearning for Truth and Love. I am with you, I am with you. God bless you. God bless you.
