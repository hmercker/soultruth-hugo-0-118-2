# Divine Love Brings the Answers You Seek

June 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2019

Island of Guernsey, UK

Received by Maureen Cardoso


God bless you, beloved souls, my name is Seretta Kem. I welcome you into this Circle of Light, opening your souls and your heart to receive the greatest gift in all the universe, the Divine Love. When I walked your Earth, I resided in the land you call Egypt. I am a chemist and healer. I reside now in the Celestial Heavens. My soul has been redeemed by the Divine Love. I now serve the children of Earth, guiding, supporting, and loving and influencing those on the Divine Path. 

These two souls who have travelled to your island to be with you in prayer have for many years walked the Divine Path.  For they have opened their souls and their hearts and their minds to receiving this Great Blessing upon their souls. They can share with you their many experiences and miracles, the changes and shifts that have happened upon their true essence by the gift of this Love. 

They are now being guided by God to move about your world and to share what is the Divine Love, the true teachings of Jesus, and the Truth of God’s Love to all those whose souls are yearning and seeking Truth. It is a great gift to sit in such a Circle and to receive the Truth of God’s Love and for a soul to be touched by this Love. For this Love works upon the soul which has been imbued with many beautiful gifts and potentials. When one receives this Love into their souls, it is the fuel that ignites a bright Light within itself. It is the nourishment of Living Waters that feed each of the gifts that are placed within your soul, bringing these gifts into a realization so that you may walk upon your Earth as an awakened soul, one who is deeply connected to their Creator and guided and carries a bright light where others will be attracted and drawn to. 

Your soul will be compelled to share this simple yet profound experience and Truth of God’s Love. It is a gift that allows the soul to infiltrate Truth, wisdom and guidance to the material mind. When the soul and material mind are in harmony, one walks with great peace, with joy, contentment and a love for all. 

My dear sister, who sits in this Circle for the very first time, we welcome you. We have been observing you and we see a beautiful light that exists within you. We wish to invite you to engage in this prayer for God’s Love for it will bring you answers of Truth, wisdom and deep knowings within you, these answers that you seek. You have received many experiences and you have many questions and wonderings. I promise you, you will receive all of your answers through this great gift of Love.

It is our hope that the two of you who reside here on this beautiful island will come together regularly and share in this time receiving this Love into your souls. We are hoping that you will engage in this time together here in this beautiful, healing chapel to bring this Divine Healing Energy, creating a dynamic, strong healing energy for all those who step foot into this chapel to be touched by. It is a great work and potential that is placed at your feet. 

One who connects with the True Essence of God’s Love receives an eternal Gift of Life, endless potentials, countless shifts and changes and miracles. There are many blessings to be received by the Touch of God’s Love. I thank you for allowing me to come and share words and invitation to come to know and understand the Truth of Creation, the Truth of Love. May your time together be blessed and we will walk with you. 

I am Seretta Kem and I thank you for allowing me to come and share my light, love, and wisdom as you pray. God bless you. My love is with all of you. God bless you.
