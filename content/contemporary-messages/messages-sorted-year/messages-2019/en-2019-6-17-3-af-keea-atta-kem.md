It is Keea Atta Kem. How good it is that you come together to drink the Living Waters of Godâ€™s Love, to replenish your souls and bring yourselves in greater communion with your Creator. How good it is that you have amongst you love and appreciation, a sense of commitment and community in this Circle of Light. How good it is that God provides for you all so that you are nourished not only in your soul but in your daily life, your material needs. That God is always there, beloveds, always there to uplift you, to uphold you, to bring Love into you, to awaken you.

For many of you, this is your life. This pursuit of the soul is your focus and this brings much to you in the way of Truth, of Light, and opportunities to serve. This will continue until it is your time to pass into spirit. God will utilize your gifts and your bright souls to be a channel of love for others.

Much is coming for each one of you. Many blessings await your prayers, your efforts to be in alignment with God. You will come to know a deep relationship with the Creator, one that deepens with every day and every prayer. With every effort that you make to be with God there will be a blessing, a Touch upon you of Light and that you will be uplifted again and again in this Light. God will speak to your soul in that quiet still Voice, urging you forward, helping you to understand the mysteries of life, the beauty of life. So much awaits for the soul who is sincerely in alignment with God, seeking His Love and Blessings, coming to know His Presence, His Being. It comes in the quiet breeze of His Breath, the beautiful Touch of His healing Love, the deep peace that passes all understanding. Much is coming, beloveds, to help deepen your soul in Love and Light, joy and wisdom. Allow this torrent of Love to pour into your soul and awaken the many chambers therein.

God bless you, beloveds. Keea loves you. God bless you.
