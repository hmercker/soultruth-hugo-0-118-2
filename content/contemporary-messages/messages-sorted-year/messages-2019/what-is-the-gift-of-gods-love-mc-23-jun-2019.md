God bless you, I am Mary and I come to be with you. Your souls yearn for the highest, the loving Grace of God’s Divine Love to enter into your souls, transforming your soul to an angelic being. There is a beautiful presence of Love that is with you now. St. Francis let you know he is the guardian of this healing chapel. I wish to let you know that I too come often during the healing services that are offered in this chapel to bring my light, my love and comfort to those who come for healing and to work through those who offer the healing.

We in the Celestial Realms long for this great opportunity to able to come close and assist the children of Earth. When there is great light in a particular place, it draws us. For many a years there has been healing happening in this chapel. It is well-established in that way. Now that there are those who pray for the gift of God’s Love within this chapel, it makes it easier for us to be here, drawing us into this beautiful healing place.

So, my dear son, your mission is great, to pray here as often as you can and to assist us in establishing dynamic Light, with great healing blessings that may come forward. We thank you for following your soul promptings to pray here and draw others in, in a very natural way, to share this gift of prayer with many. We will assist you in bringing forward the souls who are open, yearning though they may not understand what it is that they are yearning for. Should you be able to share with them this prayer for God’s Love, it will help them and plant seeds of Truth. 

Do not be concerned of the numbers but simply continue to strengthen yourself with the gift of God’s Love and allow these things to come and unfold in a very natural way. Others enjoy the simplicity and the clarity and the power once they come to understand what is this gift of God’s Love. So it need not be with too many words of description or be too strong from the mindful perspective. But what it requires is to speak from the heart and to speak from a loving experience and to share the many changes that the gift of this Love brings into your own experience. 

This is what people who are open at a level of soul desire need to experience something. So you have the opportunity to share with them what this profound gift of Love is. We will assist you. We assist all of you. There is a great love for each child that shares the Truth, receives the Truth, and walks demonstrating the Truth with God’s Love in their life. I know it is very great for each of you and I am here with you praying to receive the gift of God’s Love along beside you.

God bless you, God’s children. I am Mary. God bless you.
