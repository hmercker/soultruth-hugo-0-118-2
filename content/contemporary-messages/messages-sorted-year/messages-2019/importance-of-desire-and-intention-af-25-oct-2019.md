Beloved souls, I am your brother Matthew. In each of you there is a deep longing for God’s Love. It continues to bring you in prayer to your Heavenly Father and also continues to bring you together in this Circle of Light so that you may commune in this Light as you put forth your intentions and desire from your soul to God. You do so in these gatherings. So you bring a great Light to yourselves. So you bring a great Light to the world. As a channel of love and light, so you come together and open that portal, that great channel to the world. Powerful it is as you continue to dedicate and rededicate yourselves to the Truth of the Father’s Love, to receiving this great blessing and to be a channel of light for the world.

Beloved souls, we are very pleased that each of you have responded to the call to come together, not only in this Circle of Light but in Circles of Light that are coming and are going to be formed in various places as these channels travel and meet you all. It is important that you come together in these Circles, especially those where you are together in the flesh for none other are more powerful than this, a coming together that helps to blend and awaken the many gifts within your soul. As you come together in these Circles in unity, in a desire to connect with God and be with God in harmony and Love, so you bring a special blessing to those places where you meet and are together in earnestness and longing and desire and unity.

Know that we will continue to orchestrate those times that we are with you, beloved souls. We will continue to draw on others who have a desire within them to know this great Truth, to express this great Truth, to pray for this great blessing. Much is coming. Do not underestimate the power of God’s Will and God’s plan for the salvation of mankind and to see yourselves as part of this. To see that every moment that you pray for God’s Touch of Love, for each other, for the world, you contribute to God’s plan. Each of you have many gifts that are hidden, that are yearning to come forth, and will come forth with the blessing of the Father’s Love to awaken them and to show you your own great potentials, the beauty of your souls, the wonderment of the faculties that are within. Opening that door to God bringing the recognition of God’s Presence with you and God’s blessings, His Essence pouring within your soul.

So much awaits you, beloved brothers and sisters. So much can come from your efforts together and your desire to serve and be in the great flow of God’s Will. So you will find your way upon this path that will open doors, surprising doors, opportunities, unanticipated and unknown at this time. Yet many things can come with the mere faith and desire within your soul to be close to God and to receive His Essence. So many things will come and manifest, bringing forth change, opportunity, greater blessings, healings, great peace and joy. 

May God bless you in all of these ways, beloved souls. I am your brother Matthew and I am close to you all. Know that I am close to you all. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
