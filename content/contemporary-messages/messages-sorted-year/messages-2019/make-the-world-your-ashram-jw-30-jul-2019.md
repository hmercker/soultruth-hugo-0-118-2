# Make the World Your Ashram, Your Monastery

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am your brother and friend Yogananda. I wish to thank each one of you for taking the time to be in Holy Communion with the Heavenly Father. You have chosen this, to receive this Blessing.

You know, those who live in monasteries and ashrams and such places, where they have essentially removed themselves from the world to be in whatever form of Holy Communion they are seeking, whatever form of oneness, whether it be the natural love or in God’s Love, most of their practice is to be mindful of God, of love, in every moment. Of course this is easier to do when you don’t have to get in your car and drive to work and get groceries and take care of the rent, children and all these things in the world.

But, like you have chosen this moment to be in prayer with your beloved friends, you can make the world your monastery, your ashram. I ask you, when you’re busy, when your mind is really going a mile a minute, to just open your heart, to open your soul to God. As I have said before, if needs be, talk to God. When you send up this prayer to God, to be at-one with Him in Love, you have elevated your thoughts to the soul level. In this moment, we are all one in God’s Love. Whatever our station, wherever we are on our journey, we have allowed God to touch our souls. In this moment there is much Light in this Circle. Can you not feel this blessing?

So, my dear friends, I encourage you, make the world your ashram, your monastery. Be transformed in the Father’s Love. Be a blessing to everyone everywhere. I thank you. I send you all my love and embrace in God’s Love. May you all be blessed. I am with you. I love you all. I am Yogananda.
