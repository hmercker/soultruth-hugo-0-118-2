# Blessed are the Souls Who Yearn for God's Love

September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Elijah received by Maureen Cardoso

I am here, Elijah. Blessed are the souls who yearn for the Love of God, awakened by this touch and who come to express in their lives, the gifts of their soul. Blessed are the children who innocently walk, one foot in front of the other, in faith, who have rested their will in God’s Will and who long to serve this Will. For, they understand that God’s great design for their lives is far greater and richer than they could design upon, using their own free will. Blessed is the child who gives their will to God and awakens and walks in the Grace of Love and Light.

Children of the Earth, continue to come together in such a way. Continue to come before God, just as you do, and you will be witness to the awakening of your souls. You will be the Light that shines brightly on your Earth, the souls who God calls upon to bring peace and love and harmony, to be instruments of Love who will be used in ways known and unknown. You, beloved children, who walk this Earth with a yearning for love and for God, are deeply, deeply blessed. We, your Celestial friends and guides, come to you in service, in hopes that we may influence you in bringing greater Light, bringing awareness to thought, to the workings of your mind and to encourage you to place your mind upon God and your mind upon the rhythm of your soul. For, there is nothing greater that you can dedicate your life toward than the awakening of your soul.

You, dear children, are greatly gifted with the knowledge and the wisdom that this Love brings forward and will display in your life. When there are times that you are downtrodden, rest in the arms of God, beloved children. Turn to your Heavenly Father. Express your heart. Be transparent with God, for God knows already what is your sorrow and what are your troubles. Our beloved Creator is ever patient and awaiting that you come, humbly in the presence of this Love and bear down the anguish, the sorrow. The response of God’s Love will wash over you and will bring a crack of Light into your soul and upon the situation, uplifting you for God longs for you to be in a state of joy.

So, beloved children, you walk a great path, one of discovery, one of understanding the ways of your world, the ways of spirit, the ways of the mind and the body and the soul. It is a path full of great potential and wondrous unfolding. Continue in your prayers, beloveds. Awaken your soul. Receive this great blessing of awakening that your Heavenly Father, ever patiently, is by your side, waiting to answer your call of Love.

God bless you, beloved souls. May you rest in the arms of God, now and always. God bless you.
