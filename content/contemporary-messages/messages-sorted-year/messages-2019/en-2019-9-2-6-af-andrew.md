# Andrew conveys message from Hans Mercker, Helge's father who passed 1.5 years ago

September 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Andrew received by Al Fike

I come to convey a message from the beloved Hans Mercker, the husband of Frauke and the father of Helge. He wishes to say that he was sorry he could not be there for you in the flesh, but he was there very often while you were at their home and he wants to express his sincere appreciation and love for your efforts to uphold the two women in his life whom he loves the most and that he is doing well in the land of spirit.

He continues to work with the dark people, as he calls them. He is listening more intently to the words and truths that have been spoken as to the Father’s Love and is growing in this Gift from God and continues to awaken, awaken in his soul. He brings his love to all. He walks in light, a light that he is discovering, a journey that just begins, an understanding that grows within his heart. He will never leave his loved ones. His heart belongs to them and will continue to watch over his family. Again he wishes to emphasize his appreciation for what you have done, beloved daughters, and all of you, in your prayers and in your hospitalities and efforts to reach out to his beloved family.

Indeed the love continues to flow does it not, my friends. The opportunities arise to serve in love. Many, many more doors will be open and possibilities realized in this great flow of God’s Love.

May God bless you upon that journey, beloved friends. I am with you often. I am with this charge very often indeed. May God bless you. I am Andrew. My love is with you. God bless you.
