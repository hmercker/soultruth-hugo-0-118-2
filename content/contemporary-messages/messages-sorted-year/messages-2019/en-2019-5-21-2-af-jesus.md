Jesus received by Al Fike

Many children come and gather around the Fires of Godâ€™s Soul, warming themselves in the Grace and Flames of Love. You are blessed, beloved souls. God blesses you and comforts you and uplifts you in Light. You are blessed. You are blessed.

I am your brother and friend, Jesus. God bless you.
