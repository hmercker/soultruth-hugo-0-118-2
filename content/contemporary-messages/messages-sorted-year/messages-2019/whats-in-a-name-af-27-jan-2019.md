Sri Yarigupta is my formal name. Sri Yarisupta is a familiar name given to me as a child and I use this familiar name because I felt that you are my friends. I understand your confusions and indeed my language at the time of my birth was a difficult language to understand especially by you who live in this very different world. You are welcome to use either rendition of my name whenever you wish but know that I am your friend and that in the realms in which I live these delineations are irrelevant because we know each other by our presence. 

Names are not particularly important in this realm of Light. And so to come to your world and reveal names that are unfamiliar to you and admittedly somewhat unfamiliar to ourselves over time, there can be confusion. This instrument, although he is indeed a fine medium, can have trouble delineating the words of a particular name that is unfamiliar so will you please excuse me and my dear friend here for some confusion? It was not meant to be so but I am one and the same. 

I am very happy to be with you in these efforts for Light. God bless you, my friends. God bless you. Sri Yarigupta, Sri Yarisupta is with you. God bless you. Namaste to you, too.
