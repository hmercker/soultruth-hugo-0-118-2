# I Bring You My Gift of Healing

June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Confucius received by Maureen Cardoso

Age of old, your friend Confucius is here. What a powerful yearning each of you have within your souls, longing for God to bless you. When this powerful yearning, dear friends, draws your beloved angel friends near, we come offering gifts, our gifts of the soul. I bring you my gift of healing to each one. A great blessing of healing upon your physical bodies and your spirit bodies. Open and receive this gift, beloveds. Allow this great blessing to touch you deeply. For I am here in service to each one of you, to bring this powerful gift of healing that I carry. This gift that strengthens by the power of Godâ€™s Love. This gift that grows within my own soul as I continue to pray to the Heavenly Father, for my soul is wakening as well.

The journey is never done, beloveds. Your gifts expand for all eternity, and I shower you with this gift of healing. May you receive openly and fully, this great healing I channel through this soul at this moment. Feel this blessing of love and healing come upon you. Allow this to nourish you, to release those pains and worries, bring forth great peace and joy into your life.

My love is with each and every one of you. I will say my good-bye, but beloveds, I will remain with this instrument, offering this healing gift. God bless you in your prayers. I am Confucius. God bless you.
