All of your plans will be realized, beloved souls. There’s much work to do and it lays ahead of you, beckoning you forth, working towards unity, laying the ground work for many future plans and efforts that are part of God’s plan for the salvation of mankind. You will be making deep connections, beloved souls, touching many hearts. This is important that you allow your hearts to speak to those you meet, to embrace all you meet, to pray each day to be a channel of love wherever you may go. In this way, those who you encounter will be receptive and open to your presence and there will be a sense of a deep bond between you. This will grow and strengthen as you walk along the dusty roads of this world and reach out to the lost souls so it will grow, this work, this work of love.

You need not worry, beloveds. God has you firmly in His grasp. His angels surround you and you will find that each day will bring its blessings, often in surprising ways. Listen to God’s guidance. Listen to your own souls. Listen and there will be no mis-steps but a beautiful and harmonious expression of your souls in service to God, channels of love, purveyors of truth, bringing healing and peace, comfort and love, words that speak to the soul, touch that brings warmth deep within and a sense of peace. Many blessings will manifest through you, beloved souls. You continue to heed God’s call and walk upon this path that is destined for you. Great blessings come in your stead and much light always, beloved souls.

God bless you, beloveds. Keea loves you and will be with you in your efforts, your prayers, your desire to serve will bring many angels in your midst. Continue in your prayers, beloveds. Continue to love one another and to support one another in love and all will flow in the beautiful unfolding of the Father’s Will.

God bless you. Keea loves you. God bless you.
