The Master Jesus is here again. (Eileen Caddy speaking) How many have angels come to your door each and every day to help you to bring in your day with joy and love? How many people are guided and blessed and protected and loved as you have been? You are such blessed souls in the world. You carry such a Light and are sustained in Light in such a way that each of you could reach many souls with your wisdom, with the love that you have. 

Take into account your beautiful souls, my friends. Take into account what God has blessed you with such Love. You are truly extraordinary souls with an extraordinary message. May you bring that message to the world. It does not take much, my friends. I brought my message to the world. All it takes is a desire and determination to express the wisdom of your soul and be a Light in the world. God will do the rest. God will guide you, protect you and provide all ways and means to make you heard, your message heard, your Light seen and felt. 

What you have to give of your soul will be expressed and shared with many, provided you are willing, provided you are strong and brave. For it takes a determined soul, a strong soul to go beyond those inhibitions that are so common in life and to be a clear and beautiful channel for God. I did so. Yet I was no different from you, other than I trusted implicitly my guidance and my gift. You must trust yourselves, my friends. Trust in what God has given you. Trust in the beauty of your own soul and walk in the Light and Flow of God, and all will come to be as is meant to be. Many surprises, awakenings, experiences and expressions of love, all will be given to the souls who trust in God and walk with the Word of God on their tongues and within their souls. 
May it be so, my friends, may it be so. 

God bless you. I am Eileen. I am with you often, observing and encouraging and in my own way, influencing you to higher Truths and higher selves. God bless you my friends, God bless you. My love is with you.
