# This is a Rare Occasion

July 8<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Q&A Retreat Gibsons, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come, I am Jesus. I come to bless you, my beloved brothers and sisters, as you embark upon your tasks and endeavors to further the Truth of God’s Love in your world. I come to bless your efforts and to bless each of you and to bless this place, so that the conditions of Light, the highest of Love, the greatest flow of God’s Presence may be here for all to absorb and to benefit from and that all of your gifts, beloved souls, all your abilities, all of your love may be expressed here, in harmony, expressing the power of your great gifts, your great love.

I am with you in these efforts and I shall be with you each day, to help ensure that all will be in Light and in harmony. You have the resources of heaven at your feet, beloveds. You have the Love of God empowering the flow of great Truth and great blessings for all.

This is a rare occasion, for it is not often that such focus is upon a place in your world but in these times together you are in great Light and the angels of heaven mingle amongst you, praying with you, uplifting and upholding you, beloved souls. Take full advantage of these great blessings. Walk with your minds and your souls in the realms of heaven and you will find that great revelations and understandings will come and the joy and glory of God will burn bright in your hearts.

God bless you beloveds. God bless you, dearly beloveds. I am Jesus and I walk with you all. God bless you.
