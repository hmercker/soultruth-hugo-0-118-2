Received by Maureen Cardoso



Beloved souls, I am Mary. Yes, the mother of Jesus. I welcome each of you beautiful and precious children into this circle, this Circle of Light where that most precious part of you, the gem that you are, your soul, yearns to know the Soul, the One who has created you. For it is your soul, beloveds, that communes with God. It is how God communes with you. As you can relax in trust and open up the most vulnerable place within you to love, you can yearn and long from that precious place in you by asking your beloved Creator to bless you with the most precious gift available, the very Essence of the Creator, that known as the Divine Love. Then beloveds comes deep peace, sense of joy, healing and comfort and an understanding, a knowing that you belong, you belong. 

For your soul desires to know the loving gift of God, desires to be touched, to be cradled and nurtured by these living waters. As you open and receive this Love, these Living Waters, a great cleansing comes into your soul, washing away sorrow, worries, grief, misunderstandings, judgments and intolerance and is filled instead with love, compassion, understanding, empathy, joy and a desire to express great love and happiness to others.

Beloveds, as the gift of Divine Love gathers in your soul from your prayers and your desire to receive this gift, the transformation in your life will surprise you. It will delight you. Your soul will be compelled to continue to receive this gift, this precious awakening, coming to know who you are and who you have been created to be. You may walk guided by your soul that will be informed by God. There will be ease in your life. Others will be attracted toward you for they will see a great light that illuminates and emanates from you. The brightness will attract other souls to you. You will have the great gift of sharing your story, sharing it with many people. In this simple way that is available to all souls to come to know their own soul by this great gift of Love.

It is such a simple practice, yet it must be done by your own free will, simply opening and asking. This is all God desires of you, is to yearn and to long. From that yearning you will find a flow of Love so great into your soul, with many changes. Changes that will bring peace and harmony. These will exist within you and also around you. So, my beloveds, as you sit now at this time and open from that most precious place in you and reach to God, ready to receive this gift of Love, it shall come to you. 

My love is with you. I will stay and I will pray in silence with you for it too is my most precious gift to continue to receive. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Mary and my love is with you. God bless you.
