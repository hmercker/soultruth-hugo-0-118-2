Received by Maureen Cardoso


I am Keea-atta Kem. At this very time, your place of healing is full, full of angels. Do you feel the presence? We come because you call through your desire, your soulful desire to connect with God and receive the Divine Love and your angel teachers are drawn. We are drawn to this Light. We are drawn to support you. We are drawn to pray with you, to bring healing, to bring upliftment and to establish a tangible sense of these healing energies in this beautiful chapel. The power of the angels that are present with you now, reaches high to the heavens. 

We are helping to establish a continuous connection of healing energies that will flow to all who step foot into this healing chapel. They need not be aware of the gift of this Light of God’s Love that you desire to bring forward and are bringing forward, but each one will be touched as they step foot near this beautiful chapel and inside. The workers who are here at this very time, are being touched, though they do not know and recognize it, that these beautiful healing energies are touching them. A great power is being brought down to you now. 

You my son, our dear friend, your commitment to this place is deeply appreciated. You will feel these strengthening bonds and healing energies, be greatly established as you continue to return and pray here. All these days forward, you are the Earth angel of this chapel. We look to you to keep this Light going and glowing and we will support you in all that you do. 

You are precious souls, Loved deeply by God and loved deeply by the spirit realms. So many watch and observe you. They are attracted to you for your Light is bright and it emanates from you, attracting many. What a precious gift, all souls who pray for God’s Divine Love, greatly needed on your Earth, protected, guided. 

I am Keea-atta Kem and my love is with you and I will help to establish great light here with you. God bless you and my love is with you.
