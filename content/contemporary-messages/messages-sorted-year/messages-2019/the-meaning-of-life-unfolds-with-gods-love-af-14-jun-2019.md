# The Meaning of Life Unfolds with God’s Love

To truly understand the meaning of life, one must go into the soul awareness, the soul perceptions and understanding of life. This, as you well know, comes with the blessing of the Father’s Love awakening those aspects of your soul, those beautiful parts of your being which have deeper understanding, a greater capacity to see beyond the superficial and mundane to that which is part of the great dance of life which God has created in this Universe. When one opens up the faculties of the soul and truly comes to know their own being, their own selves in this great flow of life, in this great communion with God that allows one a true appreciation and understanding of life, then there is clarity. Then there is a deep understanding and purpose to life. 
It is like a flower, beloved souls. Think of the soul as the center of the flower. Each petal is connected to that center and each petal representing aspects of yourself and your experience in life, feeding the soul and the soul feeding the petals as they unfold. As each petal unfolds, so the meaning, the understanding is enriched and becomes more complex and richer in texture and knowledge, in love and joy. The soul slowly awakens and comes to understand what life truly is and who they truly are. In this way, meaning builds. 

The awareness of Truth, the appreciation of life, the building of Love within, the clarity of vision, the great sense of joy and compassion and passion for life for all those around you, for God and His great gift to you of life and love. All these things come into the center of your being as the Divine Love awakens you. 

So these understandings and perceptions radiate forth into your consciousness so that you see differently, that you understand from the perspective of the soul rather than the mind. In this way a steadfast and permanent and ever-growing capacity to understand and appreciate life comes into your consciousness. You see life for what it is and continues to expand in the ever-growing soul contained in the great Universe of God’s Creation. 
The meaning of life, the understanding of life, the appreciation and the joy of life grows as each drop of God’s Love settles within the soul, continuing to awaken and bring what is required to truly know the answer to this question. The power of love, my beloved souls, is the key to all answers that are Truth and give the depth and meaning to your existence. 

May God bless you with His great inflowing of Love, my beloved brothers and sisters. May you truly come to know yourselves in relationship with the Creator and in relationship with what God has created. In this way, you will come to know the meaning of life. 

I tell you beloveds that when these perceptions and awarenesses, visions and understandings come to you, you will know such a profound joy, such a profound bliss in the awakening of your soul in this way that life will take on an entirely different hue and understanding. This comes with the awakened soul and it will come to each one of you, beloved souls. 

May God bless you and keep you in His Love. I am Augustine, your teacher. I am pleased that you come together and discuss these deeper subjects. It is important to explore and to come to the realizations that God is eager to give and your soul awaits these blessings. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. God bless you.
