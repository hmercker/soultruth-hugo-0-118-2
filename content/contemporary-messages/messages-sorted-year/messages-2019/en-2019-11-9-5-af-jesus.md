# Breathe in this Light

November 9<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Fitzroy Falls, NSW, Australia

Jesus received by Al Fike

Blessings upon you, beloved souls. Breathe in this Light. Allow yourselves to absorb all these Gifts and Blessings from God. Do not hold back, but trust in the Touch of God upon each one of you. For God has a deep desire to uplift you, to bring you into that place where you and He may be together by the still waters, that you may know His Love and capture it within your soul, that this Gift, this Jewel that He puts there will be with you always and assist you in your awakening and spiritual journey towards Truth.

God has brought you together, beloved souls. God has each of you within His Heart, knows each one of you, loves each one of you beyond measure. Allow that Truth and reality to be your Truth and reality. Allow God to awaken you to something far beyond the dullness of this world into a place that brings ecstatic joy and Truth and wonderment. We are in the Presence of God, beloved souls. His Gift is His Love.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Jesus. My love for you is great. I am with you in your gathering because within your soul is a deep longing that has drawn you together in this sacred place to come to know the Truth, to come to know the depth of Love that is in this universe. May God bless you on that journey. I will be with you, beloved souls. I will be with you. God bless you.
