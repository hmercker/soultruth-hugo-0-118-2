# Healings and Blessings

April 13<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Al Fike

It is Lotus Blossom. I have brought to each of you many colors of healing for your needs, your physical needs, and your spiritual needs. As you sit within this Portal of Light, many energies are brought to you. Many blessings pour upon you. You are uplifted in this light. It is good that you come to be replenished beloved souls, that you are together in prayer and you recognize the drawings of your soul to be in Circles of Light, blessings that come in this blessed place. Remember, we are there, always there, seeking to uplift you my beloved brothers and sisters. We are with you and we continue to bring the healing energies and blessings to your beings.

Beloved daughter, we will try to uplift you and make possible for you to make this journey that you wish to do. You need but ask for our efforts and help in this regard. I would suggest that those who can may surround you in healing and a blessing.

May God bless you, beloved, beautiful souls. I am with you. Many, many are with you. This nexus of light is used by many angels to bring many blessings to your world. Continue to be open and receptive to our guidance. Continue to be with God in your dedications and prayers and efforts, to be an instrument of light, a channel of love.

God bless you. I am Lotus Blossom and I love you, beloved souls. God bless you.
