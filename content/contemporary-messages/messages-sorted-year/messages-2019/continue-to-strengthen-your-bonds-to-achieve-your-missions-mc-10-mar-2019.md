# Continue to Strengthen Your Bonds to Achieve Your Missions

Received by Maureen Cardoso



I am with you. It is Lotus Blossom. We draw together all the beautiful souls praying at this time. Those who have gathered in retreat and this dear soul who is across the waters praying together with you at this time. The light of your souls link together. Though there is a physical distance, the link of your soul feels no distance. When you pray together in this way, the bonds deepen and you can feel the presence of one another.

It is very important for the strengthening of your bonds to continue as you pray and receive the gift of God’s Divine Love. As these bonds strengthen, it will bring the deep sense to each of you, the closeness that exists within you towards one another. It is beautiful for us to see. We do our best to assist you in this process and influence you to think of one another and to be drawn together in prayer. For with God’s Love in the soul and God’s Will working in your lives, there is much work that can be accomplished. 
We come to assist and strengthen your ability to sense your soul, to sense the presence of your angel friends and to sense when your brothers and sisters are thinking of you. We help you with this. 

As this dear soul, my charge, has embarked upon her travels and has listened to the Will of God in her life, she finds herself across the waters. As her time in this place begins to unfold and she ventures forth into the World Healing Centre making friends with those there, so we will be very close to her. We have been preparing her and preparing this centre for her presence and also preparing those dear souls who currently reside within the building and who visit this building for various programs that are being offered there. 

We feel great anticipation for what may be accomplished over this next period of time, the daily visits that will happen together with her and the others. Continue to pray for the portal in this centre, for its strength and for its expansion. For it is God’s intention to have this building as a centre of light. So we work together with our dear friends on Earth to bring forward the plan God has for this centre. We bring our influence. We bring our love. We bring the highest condition possible. With these healing energies freely flowing in this portal, much will be accomplished. 

It may not be things that are so overt but God does not always work in overt ways. The subtleties of God’s Love and God’s influence and God’s workings often go unnoticed by mortals. But rest assured that with the assistance of one person within the building physically praying, this is a great benefit to us in spirit. It is our anticipation that doors will be opened and the presence and teachings of Divine Love will be shared within this building and thus we can create an opportunity for these teachings to be shared with those dear souls who yearn and seek for truth. 

So as this dear soul steps over the threshold into this building, greatly aware of the mission and purpose at hand, knowing we assist her as do her Earth friends, much can unfold. We shall see. We shall see.

May God bless you for your purpose and missions are greatly needed and deeply blessed by God. We, your celestial friends, come to serve you, to love you, to guide you, and to nurture you upon your unique paths.

I am Lotus Blossom and my love is with you. Please remember to call upon me for I bring the gift of healing to each of you. I desire to serve each of you. God bless you. I love you. I am Lotus Blossom.
