# Realms of Light 


April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am Yogananda. I come with God’s Love for all. I wish to remind you that the Master said *“There are many mansions in my Father’s house.”* Those who have passed on<sup>1</sup>, so many live, in realms of light so far above this Earth plane for in most cases, it is we who grieve. It is our loss but their gain. They wish for us to know, as the dear one just stated that *“When you call they will come, when you think of them, they are there.”* This is reflected in the statement: *“Ask and you shall receive”*, *“If you knock, the door will be opened.”* So, to those here who have lost ones to spirit world and are grieving, please know they are progressing in realms of light and love towards the Celestial Heavens. And of course, this is our wish for all of you.

So yes, work with them, remember them, hold them close to your heart. They are not going anywhere. They are not leaving your heart. They shall always be with you but the responsibility now is yours and the choices you make, these are yours. You have free will. The Heavenly Father wishes to be at-one with you and should you ask. It will be so. This you know.

The smile that comes to your face and the joy to your heart when you feel His love beaming in your soul, this is an eternal smile and it will outlast all the others. The ups and downs of this world, the concerns of this material plane are but a mere shadow of the realms of light where you are all destined to go. I say, feel joy, sing God’s praises, share with one another in happiness and joy for the loved ones that have gone on to these realms and do not be sad. You are loved and you love them and God loves all. We are all embraced in His great love.

God bless you. I love you. I am Yogananda. I love you.
