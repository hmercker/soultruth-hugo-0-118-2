# Have Fun While You are Together

August 30<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Goldie received by Al Fike

Beloved friends, it is Goldie. Be sure to have fun, my friends, while you are together. Life is not all seriousness and worry and concern for your brothers and sisters. Life is also sharing joy and bringing song and laughter and enjoyment to life. God gives you a life to express joy. To dedicate yourselves to God is to express joy. To be a channel of love is to express joy. So be joy, my friends and be joyful. Sing and dance and share a smile and give your love. This will penetrate every resistant soul more fully than any words you might speak. It is the joy that you share, the love that you bring, the embrace that you have for one another that is expressing the Truth of God, the joy of God, the Love of God. So be joy, my friends, be joy and sing from your hearts. I will be with you and tickle each one with joy because I love you all. God bless you. I am Goldie and I love you. I love you so. God bless you.
