# Share from Your Soul and Heart’s Experience When Teaching About Divine Love

Good morning, it is your teacher Augustine with you. When souls gather in Circle, coming together to experience what it is to receive within their souls and open their souls to the gift of Divine Love, this is a beautiful thing. For those of you who have been inspired to facilitate these gatherings and these opportunities for those souls who are drawn to come together in this experience, God’s Love is present. For the yearning and the longing of your souls makes it so. The Presence of God is constant. It is only in your human experience, the busyness of your world, and the material world that cuts oneself off from communing with God, having a soulful experience and connection. Yet the Essence of this Love does not dissipate. 

What is important to facilitate in these gatherings is a soulful experience. One where those who are familiar with drawing forth and opening up to the Love of God, their strength helps to bring this condition alive and tangible and close for those who are new to be able to feel. It is that feeling that you are facilitating, bringing forward an environment that supports this feeling. It is important to guide people toward this feeling, the feeling of the heart, the feeling of the soul, the warmth, the tenderness and the comfort that is given with this Love, the Presence of this Love flowing.

So as you share through your experience the feeling of God’s Love and the way God’s Love touches your soul and the mark of this Love and its transformation upon your own soul, you can reach others no matter what is their mindful belief. We caution and guide those who are leading Circles, who are to speak their experience in expressing what the Divine Love is, to speak from your experience, to allow your soul and your heart to be expressed. For when you do this, you reach others and you touch others with this message. Because the language of the heart and the language of the soul transcends that of the material mind. When expressions shared from the mind are given, they fall flat. They do not reach the heart and they do not reach the soul. As you continue to awaken within your own soul, your language and the way that you express the gift of Divine Love can become very simple. For it is in this simplicity that the heart understands. It is complexity that the mind likes to try to express. But these complexities do not reach the soul of another and the heart of another. 

Each of you are finding your way in the language, the language of your soul, the language of your heart and its expression. As you gain in this strength and also the awakening of your own soul, you will find it easier to express to others and to guide others who are new to Divine Love, the way to reach God. Remember that God’s Love and the ability to receive God’s Love existed long before the Padgett messages were received. The language that is expressed through these messages can carry an essence of Christianity. As you well know on your Earth, there are a variety of belief systems that many believe in and follow. Yet in order to touch the hearts and the souls, no matter what the mind believes, the expression and the explanation of Divine Love when shared from your heart and soul will touch others. 

Share from the knowing. Teach from your personal experience. Allow your way of expressing to come through. It is not necessary to carry forward other people’s language and the way they perhaps expressed it. For some degree that also falls flat for you are sharing from the mind. But when you allow your heart to speak, you will find that the language, the message is very simple and not full of heady words. Your prayerful life, the efforts that you make of spending time to receive this Essence of God will bring all together. For as you have been told, God’s Love is transformative and brings change and awakens gifts, draws the angels close.

We are there to support you, to influence you with a common language of love that can flow from you and share what is the experience of God’s Love, the awareness of God’s Love, and the potential of God’s Love. This will grow in each of you as your souls continue to awaken, as you come into greater alignment with God, as this power of your soul finds its expression in your life. So when you are speaking to another, be sure that you are engaged in your heart where the language of your soul will be expressed, for this will touch and reach another.

If it does not, this is not for you to worry. More so what is important is that you are giving your soul its opportunity to be expressed. The language of your soul is simple. There’s Truth, is clear and is clean. You will know when you have been speaking from your heart and soul for there will be a great flow, an ease. Mind is not so engaged other than bringing forward the language, vocalizing the language. 

Each of you are growing in this way. In your Circles of Light, for those who are facilitating, take time before the group gathers and center yourself in God, with God. Bring a soul to soul connection with God. Let God put the words in your mouth to speak. You will experience a flow of Love envelop you. If you are truly aligned, you will feel the Presence of Love with you. 

These are your markers. Speak from your soul. Bring God close and allow your experience of the Essence of God’s Love, which is transforming you, to be revealed. This, beloved souls, will touch other souls. This is part of the work of what it means to be engaged in the workings of soul. As your soul awakens, so too will your ability to express what is Divine Love with greater ease to others.

Walk in the grace of your soul. Live from the grace of your soul. Speak and see through the eyes of your soul and the mind of your soul and all will be well. For this is where your Truth resides and the wisdom and the blessings come from, is that which has been bestowed by God’s Love upon your soul. May the Grace of God’s Love continue to bless you, continue to awaken you, continue to expand your instrumentality, and to allow Love to transform your life and be witness to the transformation.

I am Augustine, your teacher. I hope I have been able to bring forth some guidance for those who facilitate these Circles of Light which draw many souls who carry many beliefs who are yearning and who are seeking. You are all growing, beloveds. You are all developing and you are all seeking which brings great unity amongst you. We shall continue to be with you as you facilitate these Circles and as you are sent out into the world to share, to speak, and to teach, and to express from your experience your experience of the soul, what is God’s Love, the Essence of Truth for all.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine and my love remains with you. My beloved students, God bless you.
