June 8<sup>th</sup>, 2019

General Collection, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Al Fike

We continue to heal and build your strength, beloved souls, each of you. As you are engaged in your work, you need this strength, this capacity to move in the world, to make efforts, to expend energies, to connect with many people. It requires a body that is able to withstand the rigors of travel and to have the clarity and consistency of body, mind, spirit in harmony and strong. So we will continue to minister to you all, help you to be uplifted in Light, and to be strong in body and to be clear in mind. For there is much work to do my friends, much work, which you all are engaged within. Continue to focus upon and listen with the ears of your soul, to the guidance that God has to give you, beloved souls.

Beloved daughter in this far-off place, I will be using you often to bring healing to many. For again, you are there to uplift and to inspire and to support those who are engaged within this spiritual effort, to bring Light to this part of the world. Indeed you will be present there, more often than you may think. It would be important for you to make arrangements, so that you may travel back and forth and to do so with ease. We will arrange for the means for you to do so, beloved soul. Continue to put your eyes upon the opportunities to serve in love, to embrace all in love, to teach Truth, to teach God’s Love, and to demonstrate these things through your gifts and knowledge and loving soul.

For the three of you, yes, there are many travels ahead and the collaborations and work, to bring this Truth to the world. You will see as time progresses, how this will unfold. Now that you committed yourself to your travels in this coming year, you will see how God will open doors, bring many surprises and allow and facilitate the connections that are God-guided and intended. You will all find your way upon this path and you will be easily led, beloveds, for you are clear upon your purpose and you desire to serve in love. With this and your connection with God in His Love, great avenues, wide and light, beautiful and clear and straight will open for you, allowing you to travel and work and minister and eat with ease.

Beloved souls, much is awaiting, much is awaiting. Our love is with you, God’s Hand upon you. This is a very important and dynamic time in your lives. Be open to what comes, what is guided and opened for you. Do not restrict your thinking. Do not move with fear or trepidation or hesitancy. Be true to God, true to your own soul. Walk in faith, walk in joy.

I love you all, beloved souls. I am Lotus Blossom and I love you all and I am close. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
