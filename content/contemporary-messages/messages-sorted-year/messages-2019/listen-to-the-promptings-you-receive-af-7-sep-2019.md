I am Mark. I am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom and I have been entrusted with the well-being of this church and those who enter therein. I wish to tell each one of you, beloved friends, that you will have an angel with you throughout the week before you return to this place. They will endeavor to help you to understand the words that have been spoken, the ideas that have been presented to you, and to understand the yearnings of your souls. 

So I tell you, listen. Listen to those promptings within you. Listen to the aching yearnings of your soul. Listen to the joy that wells up within your soul. Listen to God’s Touch upon your soul. In this way you will come to know us. In this way you will come to know yourselves and to be in alignment with all that is of Light and Truth and Love. 

May you come to that place, beloved friends, where understanding is a glimmer within you, where you have an inkling of Truth and a sense that you are on the right road towards Light and joy and Love which comes abundantly from the Source of All. We will be with you, beloved friends, we will be with you. In our endeavours to answer your questions, to assure your minds, to awaken your souls, we will be with you. For God expresses the tenderest care, the greatest of Love for all the children of this world. And for those who will open themselves to these gifts and blessings, they will know to the fullest extent what is promised and what will be delivered to each one of you. 

May you come to truly know and believe and accept the great Love of God with all its benefits and blessings. In this way, you will begin a journey like none other, experience a joy like none other, and know God like you have not known God, but will indeed be awakened to God’s Presence in your life. 
God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you and keep you in His Love. I am Mark and my love is with you. God bless you.
