# God’s Love is the Greatest Thing in the Universe

I am here Charles Chaplin. How I loved to speak the truth and expose untruth with humor while on earth. It might take an Irishman to understand my ways both spiritually and politically as I was a non-conformist with a vision. I could envision ways to tell a story that touched the heart and tickled the funny bone and so I made movies. As you may know my movies covered themes of social justice, poverty, workers’ rights, tyrants, and romantic love. I believed in love and that one should smile even if your heart is breaking. I love it that my song “Smile” still strikes a resounding chord with so many. I loved music and poetry and acting while on Earth. 

I find that here in spirit my passions continue with the addition of my progressing from an agnostic to an absolute belief in God and His Love for us. I am not a Celestial spirit but I am on the path of Divine Love thanks to my mother, always a believer who had unflinching faith while on Earth that lifted her in spirit to the Celestial Kingdom. She never gave up on me even when I so wished to give up on myself. Her mental illness on Earth had no power in this world and was dissipated in the light that was her soul. She was my guide upon crossing over and I was so thrilled to be reunited with her and I am endlessly inspired by her stunning luminosity and wisdom of the truths of the spirit world and God’s Love. I pray now for my soul to be transformed and awakened in God’s Love.  

So, my dear friends, if I could tell you one thing I have learned it would be this, God is Love. God’s Love is the greatest thing in the entire universe. You who have chosen to receive it and believe in it have chosen wisely. I am drawn to your group because of this and because this instrument has many creative projects in his, shall we say, ‘back pocket.’ We share a need to express ourselves with humor and with music and for it to be helpful to others, to serve humanity. I hope to be of service to him in getting as much of what he has received ‘out there’ as possible. He has made some great efforts at times to do this but the timing wasn’t right. It is now. We shall work together and I shall guide him through his doubts and mindset failures that have paralyzed him as they often did me.

Let there be love. Let there be light. Let the music soar and laughter and joy abound. Oh how the world needs you. God bless you. I love you. Charles.
