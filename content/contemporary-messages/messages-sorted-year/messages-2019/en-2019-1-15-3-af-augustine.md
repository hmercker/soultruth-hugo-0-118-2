Beloveds, I am your teacher Augustine. God will continue to gather you together, beloved souls. He continues to envelop you and press you to His bosom so that you know that you are not alone, that you are indeed part of this great family of God’s children.

As you come close into the light, you will release those things that bring you away from God and you will feel a sense and know, a knowing, that you are with God. You will know His Love as the cornerstone of your life, that which opens many doors of understanding and awakens your soul so that wisdom comes and love and compassion flow to you and through you to many.

Beloved children, you must walk in this world as a channel of love to pour out this light and compassion, strength and wisdom to all those you meet. You may not exchange words, but in your efforts as you walk, many things will flow and touch the souls who you encounter in your life. This ignites a longing within the souls of your brothers and sisters. Your presence, your light can do this and be a blessings for many.

God uses you in this way, beloved souls. Remember this in your busy world that all those you walk by may be blessed. Pray for this and allow this to flow through you. Have love and compassion for all of your brothers and sisters. Spread love and light to all those you meet. It may be a gaze, a touch. It may be many things but with the intention of the soul ignited in love to be God’s instruments of light, a channel of love in the world, the possibilities and opportunities are limitless.

One must walk in faith, be within that highest condition of love and intention, and all else will flow and be orchestrated by your Heavenly Father. Do not limit yourself, beloved souls, but allow the light within you to glow and brighten with each day, and thus, you will fulfill God’s Desire to be His children of love and light.

This you are, beloved souls, each one of you has a light within and you carry a great truth within you. Allow this to be expressed in the world and in this way you will be a part of God’s plan for the salvation of mankind. You and many more, these lights continue to brighten, whose beautiful souls continue to awaken, whose gifts will indeed flow and be expressed in light.

God blessed you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I am happy that you come together is this way and acknowledge one another. This is important and it has a power and a blessing that goes very deep in your world. I know for you it is difficult to understand and comprehend the power of this simple effort, but I tell you, beloved souls, your efforts will bring and bear many fruits and blessings in the world. You will see as time progresses, as your efforts increase, there will be many blessings. You will come to know the power of love expressed and shared as God blesses you all and brings you close.
