# Healing Will Come

May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Al Fike

It is Lotus Blossom and my gift is healing, beloved souls. I wish to say to you, if you call upon me, I will come and help you with your healing, with those problems and pains and hurts that beset you on the Earth plane. It is not only I who wish to come, but many from the Celestial Kingdom who are eager to assist you on Earth, to help you to be strong and free of those conditions that hold you from Light.

Ask and you shall receive, my beloved and beautiful friends. Pray for healing and healing will come. God’s Great Mercy is available to every child. His Healing Gifts and Energies and Blessings may be channeled through many of us who are working with you on the Earth plane. Ask for this gift. Ask for this gift for yourself and for many. We will make every effort, provided that this is within the flow of God’s Will to bless each and every one of you and those you love and those you pray for. For there are many in the world who are in need of comfort and healing and peace. We will come. We will come. For we are God’s instruments and it is our joy and dedication to serve in love.

God bless you. I am Lotus Blossom. God bless you.
