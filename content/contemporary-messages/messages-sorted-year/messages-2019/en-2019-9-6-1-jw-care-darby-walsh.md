# Feel the Glow of the Heavenly Father's Love

September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

This is Care. Feel the glow of the Heavenly Father’s Love streaming down from the heavens, touching your souls, the joy of the glow in your hearts when you let go and you do let God bless you. I come to join you in this Circle of Light that all may be lifted up in the Father’s Love. I wish for each one here, each heart to be open to Love, each soul to be changed. It is a glorious and beautiful thing to be transformed. I know that is the deepest longing of each one of you. As in the prayer, let us be lifted up that the Heavenly Father may reach down and shower us with Love and Grace and healing.

Such a joy to be with you all. My love to all, my thanks. May God bless you, I am Care.
