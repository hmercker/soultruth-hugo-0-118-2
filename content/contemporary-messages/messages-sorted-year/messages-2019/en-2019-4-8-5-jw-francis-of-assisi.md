# A Tribute to the Sanctuary

April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Francis of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am Francis and I come to you in God’s Love, with great love for all of you here and for this beautiful place, this sanctuary, this place of refuge for many. When I walked the Earth with my friends in the hills around Assisi, we sang and prayed with so much joy to be in God’s creation. That is why it was easy for us to open up to God’s Love in our own simple way despite our beliefs which were very Catholic. Of course we were considered outsiders because we wished to live a simple life in communion with God and God’s creation.

Those who have been to the little church that I built with my friends are aware that the presence of God and His love are alive in that church still to this day. This is because that place is respected by those who go there. I ask you to bring that same respect to this Sanctuary because this is a holy place and those who come, they come for healing, for refreshment, for the blessing of God’s Grace, and for our messages. So it is so important to keep this place as a Sanctuary, not only this room but all these grounds and the beautiful gardens that I am so fond of visiting. When there is conflict in this place or disagreement or argument, I ask you to do this with humor and love so that any negative energies are dissipated in the love.

It is a joy to come to this place and visit and all of us here, we commend you for the work you have done and continue to do, for the healings that are present here, and for the deep desires of all of you to reach out to the many in a world that is busy and conflicted as you know. This is a Sanctuary and a place of light in God’s Love. Oh, how blessed you are.

I thank this brother for allowing me to deliver this message and I am pleased with the way he has done so. May God bless you all. I love you. I am your brother and friend Francis.
