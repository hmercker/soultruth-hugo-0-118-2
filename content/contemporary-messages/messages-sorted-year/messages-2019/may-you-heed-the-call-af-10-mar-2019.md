I am Matthew. Spring begins to emerge, does it not? After the long winter snow, there is warmth and goodness coming back into the Earth. And so it is with your souls, my beloveds. New life emerges from the warmth of the Father’s Love. Many blessings will come as your souls continue to awaken in Love. So it will go, beloveds, so it will go. The awakening of your souls bit by bit. The emergence of those gifts that have laid dormant in your soul will come to light and flower in love. 

Each of you carries special gifts. Each of you has great potential. You continue to explore what is possible within you, what is part of your journey in life, and to express these things that God has blessed you with, beloveds, to express them in love. They are expressed with the power of love. Do not hold yourself back for you are needed. Each of you with your gifts, each of you with your unique perspectives and understandings of this powerful experience of love brings a beautiful gift to this wonderful mosaic of truth. 

Have faith in yourself, beloveds. Have faith in the wisdom of your soul. Have faith in the perceptions of your soul so that you may indeed release those truths that you carry to the world. Each of you walk as a testimony to God’s Love. Each of you has the potential to bring this truth to many souls. Each of you may do so in your unique ways as God’s Love continues to flow through you and over you and around you. So your words are honeyed by the condition of love that is with you. This sweetness is what draws in those who are curious and whose souls are alerted to the light and the truth that you carry. 

God needs you, beloveds, to continue to build this light within, to build your awareness, to build this truth so that you may share and be a channel to bless many in your world. Are you ready to walk in the world as a testimony to truth, as a channel of love, as an example for others to follow? God has seeded each of you with a great love, a great light. You may carry this close within, hiding your light, or you may walk with your light shining forth, with love pouring from you to all you meet. This takes a strength and faith to be able to do so with grace and humility, with such a touch of love and beauty that shines forth from you drawing in those who are feeling the longings of their souls yet unawares of how to respond to this longing deep within.

God will give you many opportunities, beloved souls, to teach these truths. You may not necessarily teach with words but with example, with your own condition of love and light but you teach nonetheless. God puts the desire within the souls of many for this gift of love. Their souls are stirred as they feel and sense the light within your soul affirming this truth and bringing the possibility of this gift to conscious awareness in another. 

You are each called. The bell tolls for the souls of light and truth to step forward in this world, this world so bereft of love. You, beloveds, who know this gift, some of you know it so very well, it is second nature, to pray and be in the flow of God’s Love. Continue to walk forward in this light. Be brave and strong. Be faithful and rely on God’s guidance to place you in those positions, conditions, opportunities to serve in many different ways, to teach in many different ways, to be a shining example of this great gift and truth. Ask with each prayer that you put forward that you may be used as a channel of love in the world, that God may place before you an opportunity to serve. You will find that there will be many opportunities that you are mostly aware of to do so.

God answers your prayers. When you put forth your desires, your intentions in prayer, this makes for a powerful opening for these gifts within you to shine forth, for God to align you along your road of service bringing those opportunities at your feet. You need not struggle and strive for this to happen, beloveds. It will happen. It will unfold in surprising ways, in beautiful and unexpected ways.

God’s plan for the salvation of mankind is well under way and He needs those who are willing to serve to these ends to bring the change to this world that will bear the fruits of love and harmony and truth. Are you willing, beloveds, to step forward in this way, to try, to say a prayer each morning and ask to serve, to be in the flow of God’s Love in some simple but powerful way with each day? God lays before you many opportunities and God waits for your decision to step forward. Indeed there will be harmony with each life that lives in this flow of love. God does not intend to disrupt your life. This is not the way of God, but God will enhance your life. God will open doors. God will show you the way if you are willing to listen and to be attuned to God’s Will. 

Beloved souls, you are deeply blessed. You have a great light within. You have a measure of wisdom, many gifts and strengths and blessings. Step forward. Know that you are upheld and that in the flow of God’s Love, there is much that will flow and awaken and come to fruition. So that when that time comes for you to transition to our side of life, there will be a sense of joy, of satisfaction, of knowing that you had played your part in this great effort to uplift humanity. This is what is important in life at this time. This great importance to bring forward truth. Though you may feel that often what you say goes upon deaf ears, I tell you, wherever you go, you will plant seeds and you will bring the truth and the light of truth. Though you may be turned away from those whose minds resist the calling of the soul to God, you plant these seeds that are powerful and will at some time bear fruit.

Have faith, beloveds. Have faith in God’s plan for you and the opportunities that God places before you. In the great potentials of your own soul that is ripe and full of many beautiful gifts, bringing the possibilities of God’s plan forward in life. You are called. We have called you together to remind you of this invitation from God to walk upon the path that God has designated for you, a path in which you are accompanied by the many angels, a path that will bring the upwellings of the soul, a path that with each step into the future there is a greater light and commitment and wisdom and understanding all infused with love. 

You are called, beloveds, to serve for light, to serve your brothers and sisters upon the path of light. May you heed this call. May your prayers ask what you may do in service, in love, in harmony with God’s plan and all will unfold in beautiful and harmonious ways. You will see, beloveds. You will see as time continues to pull you forward. Your service is important. Your efforts are crucial. Your love must be of the highest. It must flow and flow in many different directions and ways and means that will serve God. 

Blessed and beloved souls, may you continue to receive these great gifts of Love. May it continue to open the portals of your soul, so that light may flow and God’s Will may manifest in your lives. Beautiful and blessed souls, you are standing upon the threshold of a new day, the dawning of the truth of love in your world. May you stand hand in hand in this great service and great event of the unfolding of God’s plan for the salvation of mankind.

God bless you, beloveds. God bless you upon your journeys and know that you are never alone and that with each moment comes the potential to serve humanity in love. God bless you, beloveds. I am Matthew and I have great love for you, for all those who are willing to walk in light and truth and serve in light and truth. God bless you. God bless you.
