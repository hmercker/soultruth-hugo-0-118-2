# God Loves You Beyond All Measure

March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2019

Soul Awakening Tour Eastern US, Hollis Woods, Queens, NY, USA

Andrew received by Al Fike

Godâ€™s healing and peace, may you absorb this into every part of your being and know that God loves you beyond all measure. The two are His children, that you are truly blessed, and that you may avail yourselves of all His blessings that are without end. It is but for you to ask.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Andrew. You have built a great light here with your prayers and your aspirations. Sustain this light. Keep the light within this place like a glowing lantern in the dark and it will warm you as you commune here in loving acceptance, in prayerful desire to be with God.

God bless you, beloved souls. All obstructions that may be in your way may be removed and peace will be in its place. God bless you, beloved souls. Andrew loves you.
