I am here Yogananda. Dear friend of my soul, beloved brother on the path of God’s Love, it is my joy to be with you in this endeavor and I thank you for stepping up to receive what I wish to deliver. The vastness of the Universe when viewed from the world of spirit is so humbling and at once so exhilarating that I ask each soul to consider what lies ahead in light and love in the Celestial realms for those who seek to be at one with their Creator. What magnificence, what bliss, beyond any earthly description or comparison will be yours. 

You may feel at times that you are being required to give up the things on Earth that you hold so dear, that you cling to, that you feel sustain and comfort you, but I tell you unless these things are harmful to your soul progression, they need not be discarded. What needs to be discarded is the multitude of distractions available to each in the modern world that occupy so much of your time like painkilling drugs, which only give temporary relief from the pain of separation from God that each soul feels to a greater or lesser degree, whether consciously aware of it or not. 

Of course those on the spiritual path begin to see their addictions and distractions over and against the bliss of being in harmony with God’s love and laws, and therefore at some point make a very concerted effort to pray and meditate so that their consciousness becomes aligned with God’s Love and light, more and more, deeper and deeper. This is my wish for all of you to consider for your soul's progression, for your happiness, your real happiness.

What is of importance in any given moment? What is your deepest desire? You know that in any moment you can connect with our loving Creator in your feelings for God’s Love in your heart and your soul above your mind and the world of thoughts. When you are in your soul, as has been discussed lately, you feel a oneness in love, over and above the world of mind, a true connection that because it is of the soul, may be in fact difficult to put into words but is undeniable in feeling. Bliss and Joy pervade and outshine the world. Questions get answered and dissolve into light. This is the hand of God upon you dear friends. This is the embrace you long for. And as you continue to walk on this path you will see more and more the workings of our Glorious Creator and you will never be disappointed for God will provide all as it is written: *“Every good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."*

I love you. May God continue to bless you each with Love Divine! I am Yogananda.
