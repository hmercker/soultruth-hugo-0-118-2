# Please Take These Questions to Heart

February 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2019

Online Prayer Circles, Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Maureen Cardoso

Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. A wonderful message from dear Andrew which I encourage you all to heed and spend time upon reflecting his great guidance.

Beloved souls as your teacher, I wish to come and acknowledge these recent days in prayer where many gathered locally to be given the opportunity to ask many questions which came from your curiosity, and questions that would help further soul development. We are very pleased with your questions, beloveds. And we are also very pleased with the dear soul, the medium that we used to bring forth these further truths and deeper teachings, for through his dedication and prayer and his soul awakening, we have been able to work with him furthering his gift of mediumship. We are very pleased with the messages, the way they were received through him. He is a gifted medium, a gifted instrument for God and we wish to give thanks to his dedication.

Beloveds, these many extraordinary messages that came through I ask you to take them to heart, to take them seriously, to study them, to review them for there is much in these messages that will assist you as you go about your daily living and God places others before you where you converse. Potentially these people are curious about your spiritual life. We understand that it can be somewhat intimidating to share these Truths as they do not often coincide with what already man believes about God and the love of God. But beloveds, there are many teachings for you to share in a very natural way of these Truths. So I ask you to take these teachings and to learn them, to bring them deeply into you, into your understanding both on a soul level and within your mind, as well. These are the things you want to fill your mind with. This is the knowledge to carry within your mind to be able to share freely.

You are all dedicated students all beautiful souls with great lights, with a deep purpose in your world to shine forward, to allow the Love that is within your soul to bless another. It is not something you need to force upon another. No beloveds, this is not what I encourage. But as others see this Love working upon your soul affecting your personality, affecting your choices, all more aligning with love, they will be drawn to you and become very curious. You will have the strength and the words to share with them.  If you are not sure beloveds, say a prayer asking God to place words to share, asking God to help you fulfill your purpose before this person. It does take practise and it does take action. You spend many hours in prayer receiving the great gift of Love and that Love that resides within your soul desires and requires an avenue, an avenue to flow through in your words, through your actions, through your pleasantries.

We dedicated much time recently to these great questions of yours, but beloveds take the time to review them, to learn them, to use them as the great gifts that they are. We know that there will be another gathering in the not too far off future where we will be given the opportunity to answer more of your questions, your soulful questions. I would encourage you to begin to formulate more questions. Not necessarily asking them at this point but preparing, preparing for your future. What may come of your question as you formulate, God hears your question so you may be gifted with the answer within your soul. Is that not the great connection of Godâ€™s Soul to your soul where you may receive the blessing of the answer of Truth within your soul from your beloved Creator?

My love is with all of you, beloveds. As your teacher, I have the great gift of being able to speak straight to you, with love but straight. Please take these messages to heart. Receive the gift that they are.

God bless each of you, beloveds. I am your teacher Augustine, and my love is with you. God bless you.
