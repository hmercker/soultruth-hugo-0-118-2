# The Magnetism of God's Love

I am here Luke. When I walked the earth, the Master had asked that we go out and preach the good news of God's Love without regard to culture, race, where one resided or what they believed. We were in fact not asked to start a new religion, but to bring news of God's love to all. This request is still the same as it was then.

And you see how things have become organized and institutionalized in the world. This is the way of the world. And quite often those who are good at this job of organizing and creating institutions are not so good at opening their hearts and souls to the love of God. Not because they are bad people, but because they have an intellectual understanding that doesn't include the opening of their soul.

So I say to you - it is important, to touch the heart of all with kindness and love, always forgiveness. Or as the master said, *"Love all as I have loved you"* and you know he meant with God's Love. This is the divine balm that he offered the human world.

We in the Celestial Heavens have nothing but love for you. Can you feel this? We live in a realm of light. It is beyond the imaginings of those on the earth plane. I say your soul can sense this; it can see this light, it can feel the love.

Yes your job is not to be too distracted. And yet, you live in the world. We understand. So to live in the world and be above it. Or to live in the world and not live in the world at the same time, with your soul in God's love, and your feet upon earth. In this way you can move forward. You can move mountains. You can touch hearts. The magnetism of God's love attracts every soul that is open and longing for it. Just plant those seeds. This is all you need do. Be not concerned for the harvest. For that is God's business.

We wish to say - and to remind you - there is much love from this realm, to all of you on the earth. Those who wish to progress in this love - we are with you. Acknowledge this and know, it is closer than you imagine. We are with you, and we love you. Go in God's grace and peace.

And know I am your brother and friend in Christ, Luke.
