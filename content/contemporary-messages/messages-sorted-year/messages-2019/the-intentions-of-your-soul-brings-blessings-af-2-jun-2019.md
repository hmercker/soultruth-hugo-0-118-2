Dear beloved souls, I am Mary. Yes there is great beauty in the world, a great beauty of God’s Creation, a great beauty in every soul who aspires for goodness and light and love. What a soul aspires towards, what a soul thinks and is in the world, draws to them through the Laws, a response. So if that soul aspires for beauty, for love, for goodness, even for abundance, then they are thusly blessed by God. It is the power of the desire within your soul and the intentions within your minds that bring many blessings to you, beloveds. As you continue to draw in the Father’s Love into your souls, so what you signal to God and beseech God to bless you with, grows more powerful. Your intentions are clearer. They resonate through the world, through the Universe of God and touch God more directly. 

So, my beloveds, when you pray, pray from your soul. Know your intentions. Know what it is that you truly desire. Those intentions and longings within you, inform your presence and grace in your life, inform what is to come, inform what can be. So, my beloved souls, beautiful children of God, know your own souls and come to allow the intentions of your souls, the knowings of your souls to be expressed to God and to be expressed in your world. In this way, many blessings come. In this way, the realization of the potentials and the purpose within you is made real and palpable in the world. 

You each carry great potentials, beloveds. You each aspire for the highest and you long to serve God. These beautiful intentions within you and desires are what will bring the many blessings for others, as a channel of Love and will bring to you greater awareness, deeper Love and great wisdom. All this comes from a simple longing from within you. All that comes is in response to your prayers and God’s Love for you, beloveds. Each of you are deeply loved. Each of you are deeply cared for. Each of you have angels that surround you, uplifting, protecting, guiding, assisting you in your prayers, bringing to you the inspiration and the upliftment that inspires you to long deeply, more deeply for God. 

May God bless you, my beloved, beloved children. Know that you are in the Light. Know that God has His Hand upon you, my beloveds, and that you are within our thoughts, the thoughts of our souls. For when we pray, we pray for you. We seek to do God’s Will on your behalf, to bring the blessings forth, to bring the light to you and to your world. 

May God bless you, beloveds. May God bless you. My love is with you. I am Mary and I am with you. God bless you.
