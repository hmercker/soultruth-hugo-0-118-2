# Divine Love Transforms Your Soul from the Image of God to the Substance of God

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your brother and friend Yogananda. It is a delight to be in this company, in this Portal of Light. So many diverse souls and yet, we feel the longings of each one. As you may know, I brought Kriya yoga to the West. This was technique and is a technique still used to connect with God, to heal the body, to uplift the heart.

I wish to say to you, this Divine Love, this opening of the heart brings a response from our loving Creator to fill the soul with Love for each one who asks. This Love transforms the soul from the image of the Creator into the very substance that you may be at-one with God. This is the Great Gift for all to discover, and my dear friends, some of you who have sought for so long, others new, this is my wish for you and all of us here in the Celestial Kingdom, to see this transformation in Love, God’s Love.

May this day bring a song in your heart, a healing in your soul, in your body, in your mind. May you all be lifted up in the Love of God and in the Light of Grace. I love each and every one of you. We all embrace you in God’s Love. I am your friend and brother, Yogananda.
