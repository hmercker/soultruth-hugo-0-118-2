# Your Dedication is What is Needed in Establishing this Circle of Light

Received by Maureen Cardoso


It is Augustine with you. So you are gathered together in this wondrous part of God’s planet Earth, in the most beautiful part of the world for sure. We have already seen part of the great beauty that exists. We thank you for hearing the call to come together in support of this dear son who has a desire to create and establish a Circle of Light in this healing chapel. We wish to assist you in strengthening the light that exists here. By the three of you coming together in prayer, bringing God’s Love into this place, much can be done. 

We will assist you, my dear son, as you deepen your dedication and your focus upon your commitment for your Circle of Light. It is definitely needed. You may find as you dedicate to your allotted time, even if it is just you that comes to pray, we will be with you. We will assist you in drawing those beautiful souls who will open to God’s Love into your Circle. Do not be so concerned if the numbers are not what you hope or expect. What is important is that there is one dear soul who prays for God’s Love and generates and strengthens the Light. For it is through their action that others will come.

So your dedication, dear son, is what is first and foremost required. Your sincere prayer to God to be of service and a channel of His Love and Light is what will bring forward greater Love and greater Light. As the three of you experience these next few days together, you can pray as often as possible, for sure daily. You will find the gift of this Love and this Light strengthens.

You do a great service to your homeland. We will be with you assisting you in every way that we can. You always know that there is much more that happens behind the scenes that you are not able to recognize at this time. So be of great joy and be of love. Be of light. Be of peace. Allow the harmony of God’s Love to strengthen the wonderful bond between your souls.

I am your teacher, Augustine. I am here with you. Many Celestial Angels are with you. God bless you. My love is with you always. God bless you.
