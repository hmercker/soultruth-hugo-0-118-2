Online Prayer Circles, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May God’s Love find its benediction upon your soul, beloveds. I am your brother and your friend, Jesus. I come to encourage you, beloved souls, upon your path to at-onement with God, that your souls may continue to open to this great blessing, the Essence of God pouring in, transforming you, healing you, uplifting you in Light. God has His Hand upon each one of you, beloveds.

You are drawn together because your souls thirst for truth and love, blessings and light. I am drawn to you because of your souls’ desires making it possible for me to speak to you and to have a bond of love with each of your souls. Know that I know you, beloveds, that I am with you, that my love is with you, and that I work with each one of you upon your paths of enlightenment, awakening your souls to God, awakening your souls to God’s Will. Blessed are those who seek to walk in this Light, who seek to serve God in Love, who pray for the benefit of their brothers and sisters in this world of yours. For each prayer that you put to God, each effort that you make in light, each time you choose to love and to bring peace and truth, you are blessed, beloveds and you further the efforts of God to bring Light to your world.

May you continue upon that journey.  May you continue to walk upon God’s path, this journey of love that points to truth. This great awakening that comes with the Father’s Essence within you. You are blessed, beloveds, and I am with you. Remember this, wherever you may be, whatever you may do, whatever condition you are within, that you are loved by God and that you have a place within my heart for I love you. I am with you on this journey and your struggles. Those times when you reach for light, know that you are not alone ever and that you are loved.

God bless you. I am your brother. I am Jesus. God bless you.
