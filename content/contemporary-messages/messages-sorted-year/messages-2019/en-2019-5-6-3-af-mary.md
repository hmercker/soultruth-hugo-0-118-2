# Bask in the Grace of God

May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons Circle of Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mary received by Al Fike

I am Mary and my love is with you all, each precious soul in this circle. I want you to know there is great light here this night. We have brought many children who are in spirit to this circle. They sit amongst you, basking in this light, absorbing the great Peace of God that nourishes all our souls. Open your souls wide, beloveds for these are special moments of Grace from God. A Light that pierces through to the Heavens is with you at this time and many angels surround you. Drink deep of these Living Waters and know that God loves you deeply, each one of you.

God wishes for each of you to receive His Love and know it from the very depths of your beings that you are precious to God, beloved by God, and meant to be in this Grace always. Feel the upliftment of your souls, beloveds, and know that you are truly blessed at this time. For in the Grace of God you dw in these moments of prayer together.

God bless you. I love you. I am with you as well. Many are with you in these sacred moments. God bless you.
