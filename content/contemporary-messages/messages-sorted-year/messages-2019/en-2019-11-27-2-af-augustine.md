# You are to Continue to be an Instrument of God

November 27<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Hawaii and Australia Retreat, Sydney, Australia

Augustine received by Al Fike

I am Augustine. It is easy for us to go from one to another when the atmosphere is conducive. This instrument represents an example of how you are to continue to be an instrument of God. His strengths and his capacity for mediumship have been hard-won. Many years of preparation, trials and tribulations, even a number of accusations from others indicating that he is not whom he appears to be. This you must all be prepared for, beloved souls, if you are to step forward in this way for there will always opposition. There will always be jealousy and judgment and fear and disregard for the gift that has been given in Love.

Each of you must prepare yourselves continuously for this work, strengthening and becoming immune to these slings and arrows that are set before you. The power of negative forces in the world is great as you know. The challenges will always be a part of this gift and effort. Yet you also experience the jubilation and joy that comes when an angel can indeed make such deep rapport with you that something profound and beautiful may be expressed through you. As you continue to grow in the Father’s Love, so the channel for this gift widens and the capacity for us to communicate our intended messages grows, as has been stated through our other instrument, there is a great need for those who carry this gift to carry it forward in the world.

As the world continues to change and the attitudes and preferences and predilections of humanity continue to evolve, so the ways of communication change. The possibilities of what may be accepted and absorbed by those around you are in a constant state of flux. So where one medium is not able to bring forth a message in a way that is acceptable or others are willing and receptive to listening to, then another may take their place and bring forth what may be a life-changing experience or phrase or word that will help that individual upon their spiritual path.

We are experimenting, beloved souls, as are you in these ways and means of communication. Nothing is set in stone other than seeking for the highest, continuing to grow your soul in the Father’s Love, and being open to the influence and love of the angels and to God’s Will. In this way, there are no limitations, merely great possibilities, openings to what can be through each of you as instruments of God’s Will. The moment you set limitations upon yourself, the moment doubt creeps in and fear and judgment of yourself, you do not allow the Will of God to be expressed clearly. Of course, you are all human. These elements are a part of your life and consciousness. But as you continue to grow in the Father’s Love and continue to allow this expression of love through our communications to widen and deepen and be accepted by yourself, then much can be given.

Yes, you are all being tested. You are all being trained. You are all being nurtured and awakened in an ongoing process that comes with the building of Love within your soul. As you grow stronger, so you will wade into different atmospheres, groups of individuals who have varying ideas and often different from your own. This can be challenging. Yet in God’s Plan as His instruments, you are called forth to awaken others to this Truth. You will find yourselves in conditions and environments and situations that are not easy to navigate as you have been in the past week with those who have one attitude of desire for Truth and another for skepticism of what you bring.

This ambivalence is difficult to navigate and yet you did navigate through this environment and brought harmony amoungst that group of people who were drawn and yet felt leery of your message. You see when you walk into an environment that is difficult, this is a test of your own faith, your own trust in God that you may be in that grouping or situation open to the influence of the angels, to God’s Touch, to the Light and Love and flow of God’s deep caring for all souls. In this way, whatever is meant to be accomplished will surely be accomplished through you.

Now it is up to the individual who is receiving what is given to accept or not. This we cannot determine nor insist upon with any individual for they are imbued with free will. So it is not for you to judge whether you have been successful in inspiring a soul to receive the great gift of God’s Love. For you cannot see within their soul. You are not equipped as yet to do so. So you must travel blindly with faith. You must seek God’s influence and blessing upon you to be His instrument and to be open and confident in what may ensue in every given moment, every day you have ascribed to the Will of God, and done your work to the best of your ability awakening your gifts as you go in this flow of service, of giving of love.

Put the needs of others first, beloved souls, when you are in service in this way. Have compassion for your brothers and sisters. Know that whatever you give in love will be rewarded in love. There are no limitations except that which is placed upon yourself by your own will. Strive to be a clear and open channel for God’s Love to manifest in whatever way that it is manifest is what is intended by God. Do not judge yourselves nor feel inadequate or weak for you are not. By merely following God’s Will and being in any particular place in which you are guided to be, you are showing great strength and faith. God will use you to the limitations of your own biases and restrictions and soul growth. Yet does that not continue to grow and awaken with time and prayer?

Yes, we are pleased, very pleased with your efforts, each of you. Know that the doors continue to open for you all. There will be many more opportunities. You will see for yourself as you continue to grow how effective and powerful you will become as you continue to exercise the capacities of your soul, the power of your faith, the wonderment of Love that grows within you. Continue to act as an instrument of God. With each day, the opportunities arise to do so. You will find that great change will ensue. Beautiful expressions will be given through you to many souls. A beautiful light, beloveds, you are all beautiful lights. Continue to shine forth, shine forth in love.

God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. I am Augustine. My love is with you, blessed souls. God bless you.
