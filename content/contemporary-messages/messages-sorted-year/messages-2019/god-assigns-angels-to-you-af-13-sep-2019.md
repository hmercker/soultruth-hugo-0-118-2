Bless you, beloved souls, I am Confucius. You have received a gift of healing, each of you, a blessing upon you. We come to these Circles to speak in order to remind you that we are close, that we are much closer than you might think. For when you desire to walk upon this Divine Path, so God assigns angels to be with you, to accompany you upon that journey. Though you may not know during your day of our presence, know that you are blessed and you are protected and that you are close in Light. 

Seek the highest. Seek the great gift of Godâ€™s Love. In so doing, you will come to know us as your friends and companions upon the journey of Love. We are with you, all of you. We are with you and I bless you, beloved souls. Know that I am close. God bless you. Confucius loves you dearly. God bless you.
