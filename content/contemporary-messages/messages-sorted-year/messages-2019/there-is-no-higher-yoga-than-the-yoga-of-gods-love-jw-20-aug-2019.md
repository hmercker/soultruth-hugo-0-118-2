I am here in the Love of God, I am Yogananda. We in the Celestial realms are drawn to you in this Circle of Light. I wish to tell you that this is the yoga of love, God’s Love. There is no higher yoga. There is no finer belief. When you suspend your doubt, your reluctance, your material mind, which is the world, you allow your soul to be opened by God’s Love. This of course can be done in a moment’s notice. The wish you have deep within each of you to awaken and be transformed when accompanied by faith and the suspension of disbelief or doubt or skepticism, allows our Heavenly Father to touch your soul, to open it up to His Love and to change it.

This journey is endless but it is not without a beginning. So I say to you, those of you who have just begun, there is much to be gained in the world but so much more to be gained by being transformed in God’s Love. So with a little bit of effort, you can direct your will to God’s Will. Allow your heart to open in faith, open to Grace. This will make a huge difference in your lives, not only that, but in the lives of all you touch, and you will touch many.

It is our Celestial desire to help each one of you. Do not fail to call on us as we are here for you. We cannot resist the call from your soul when you need assistance, when you need a healing. If you are surrounded by unharmonious or vexed spirits, call on us. We will come. Reach out to God. Those negative influences, those spirits cannot be in a place where God’s Love is and stay negative. So it is with each of you. Once you open to this Grace, negativity will dissolve, loves comes in. Love will heal you, change you, transform you, awaken you. So, my beloved friends, as always I urge you, stay in the Love. Pray often. This is the yoga of God’s Love.

My love to each one of you. So blessed you are to have each other. We are with you. We love you. May God bless you, each one, and transform you. You are angels in waiting. I love you. I am Yogananda.
