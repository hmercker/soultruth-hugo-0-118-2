# The Harmony in a Group Reflects the Harmony within the Individuals

December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Waianae, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Maureen Cardoso



It is Keea. We were with you this day as you maneuvered your way around this beautiful island, walking in glorious gardens, amongst flowering fauna and the waters. We observed this day, these days, that you have been together with great harmony amongst you. That is a gift. You are a gift to one another. You are not able to have harmony in a group without having a certain amount of harmony within yourself. So it goes. The greater harmony and sense of steadiness within your own being that you experience, so too, shall the group reflect this harmony. 

The gift of Divine Love helps you as the conditions that are out of harmony in the Laws of Creation are lifted. These encrustations upon your soul are melted away and lifted from your soul, this Love of God then residing in your soul. This allows a greater degree of harmony to exude within your own being and emanate from you. Even as you travel along the roadway, these congestions and this long road home that you each experienced, you are able to bring good cheer amongst you. 

Perhaps what could have been great tension was easily corrected due to the love that existed within your soul and this great harmony amongst you. So what could have been great stress after this day was experienced to some degree as a sense of peace coming together as a team, pulling your efforts together for your brothers and sisters and sharing a meal in joy and laughter together. So, beloveds, I say this for I wish to bring to your attention, the gift of harmony comes with the blessing of Divine Love within your souls.  

We enjoyed this day with you. We shall continue to enjoy the remaining days that you have together. We will join you when you gather once again on this beautiful island. For it brings a great need of yours for as you do this work for God, in sharing the Divine Love Truths, God knows you need to be strengthened and replenished. This beautiful island is a chosen place for you to do so. 

The dear son who resides on this island appreciates his dear friends enjoying his homeland. He can share his love and knowledge of this most gracious place. So you shall return again but please enjoy these days, these few remaining days that you have together to gift yourself with time filled with relaxation and joy. For as you each return home, your duties are awaiting you. You will feel replenished and filled with joy as you return home. 

There may be some who upon their return feel experiences of, to some degree within themselves, a sense of imbalance. What this is, beloveds, due to so much of this Love touching your soul, it is like a re-calibration and a balancing that will require some time to settle within you. There may also be some who move through expiation, for as you all know this is what you could say is a by-product of receiving the love. You move through times of release. Be easy with yourself. Allow this to move from you if this should be the case when you return home that your body and mind move through a degree of expiation. But all is well, beloveds, for you are carried by God, nurtured in His Love, and cradled in His Arms.  So allow yourselves to move through all of this with a sense of ease and well-being, knowing that once the release has occurred, greater joy, greater harmony and greater peace will be yours. 

God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea-atta Kem filled with great joy seeing the light, the love, and the harmony that exists between you. God bless you.
