# We Became Fishers of Men

August 29<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

I do not come often but the Master has asked us to be close. It is said I was the rock on which what became the church was built. Indeed they could have been talking about my hard head. For you know I had denied the Master and I was so filled with shame and guilt but then there was the Pentecost where there was a great showering of the Heavenly Father’s Love upon us all. Undeniable it was. We truly became fishers of men and we cast a wide net far and wide. 

When you wonder: *“How shall we attract this group or that?”* I could say, yes, it’s like fishing. If you wish to catch a particular kind of fish, you might want to use a particular kind of bait. So at times this is appropriate. But as [my brother Matthew has said to you](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2019/your-work-is-the-work-of-the-humble-child-af-29-aug-2019/), the process is slow and those who have a deep desire in their souls to discover this Truth, they will be attracted to you. So you may indeed cast a wide net and make your rock the Father’s Love. Many will come. As you begin to go far and wide and see small results, you know in your hearts and in your souls, every time a soul is touched by the Father’s Love, it is a great victory. It is a wonderful celebration. So really you begin a church anew minus the errors, but really focused on the one great Truth of the Father’s Love. 

I shall come again but I wished to come and bless you all and bless this work and support it and so I will. My love and blessings to all and to this work and to this place, this Portal of Light, and those who come. May the Heavenly Father bless each one and infill and inflow their souls with His Love. May God bless your work and each one of you. My love and blessings. I am Simon Peter.
