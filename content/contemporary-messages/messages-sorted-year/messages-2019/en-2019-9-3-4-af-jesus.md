Jesus received by Al Fike

Brothers and sisters all, I come, I am Jesus. I come to ask you to know me in your prayers. Know my presence with you in your prayers and in your life, for I am with you all. My love is with you all and I continue to walk with all my brothers and sisters who endeavor and seek to be within the flow of Godâ€™s Love, a child of God; those souls that continue to open to His Gift of Love.

Know that when you walk in this way, in this Light, that I walk with you and am with you. Come to know me beloveds. Come to know me for, I am with you and my love for you is great. I shall always walk with you beloved souls; I shall always walk with you, for we are all a family of love, children of God seeking to know and be at-one with God.

We will uphold one another; shall we not, my beautiful and beloved friends? We shall walk together and seek the Grace of God with every breath. God bless you beloved souls. I am with you; know this, feel my presence. I am with you. God bless you. God bless you all. I love you.
