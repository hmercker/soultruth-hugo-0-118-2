# Your Soul's Spiritual Journey in God's Love

October 19<sup>th</sup>, 2019

Divine Love Mediumship Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Confucius received by Al Fike

Little birds, it is Confucious. Each of you within your souls has a vast treasure trove of gifts and abilities that are waiting to be employed in your lives and your existence in this world and the next. Consider that what you know about yourselves is very small indeed, compared to what is within you, and what you are capable of. Do not restrict your thinking and your doing in regards to your spiritual service in the world and your spiritual journey discovering yourself and discovering the wonderment of Godâ€™s Creation.

You will come to know the vast spaces of your soul as it expands through the Gift of the Divine Essence of God, His Love. This journey of discovery and awakening will go on for eternity and you just begin. My little birds, your eyes are barely open, your wings rudimentary and need to grow so that you may fly and soar in the great expanse of God's Reality and understanding.

God gives you this gift of coming together, of being a part of mutual awakening and discovery and love. Accept His invitation to continue to grow in love, to help one another to understand this journey that in the beginning seems a mystery and so complex, but in truth, it is simple and fulfilling and full of joy. Know yourselves, beloved souls, in relationship with your Creator. Allow His Love to permeate every part of your being, awakening every aspect of your being, so that all the wonderful potentials, all that which is within you may be awakened that you may come to know what God has truly created in Love. That you may serve your brothers and sisters in love, that you may walk the Earth with a deep peace and wisdom and love for all so that God may use you with every breath, every moment that you exist in this world as a channel of love and light, of truth, wisdom and joy.

Beloved souls, may you continue upon this journey and continue to awaken to the many possibilities that God rests upon you in hopes that you may accept His invitation to awaken to all that you are and to be all that your souls have brought in your life.

God bless you. I am Confucius and I bring you my love and blessings. I bring a blessing for this place and all who come and pray here, a blessing, a light, and great love. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you deeply. May you be in harmony with all that is in the realms of the great Creator of Life. God bless you. God bless you.
