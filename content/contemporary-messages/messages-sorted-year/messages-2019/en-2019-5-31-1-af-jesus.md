Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved brothers and sisters, I come. I am Jesus. I come to bless my brethren, those whose souls are truly touched by the Father’s Love. I come to reassure you, beloved souls, that the Heavenly Father works ceaselessly to bring this Truth of His Love to humanity and that within each of your souls is a true longing to bring this gift forward to all that you know and meet and love in this world. This longing and desire is blessed by God and gives the impetus for you to be guided to bring this Truth to those you meet in this world. Know that when you speak these words of Truth, when you talk of the Father’s Love and its transformational qualities, that you do my work, that you carry the Truth that I carried in your world, and you continue to speak these words of Truth, however simple they are, they have the power to change the world.

My blessed brethren, may you continue to speak these words of Truth, carry this mantle of Love, this Light that is a blessing that can be given through you to others. Know that the angels of Heaven walk with you, beloved souls, and are earnestly seeking to bring greater Truth to humanity. We are with you, beloveds. I am with you always. In my heart, my Love is with you, beloveds, In your souls, the Father’s Love continues to flourish and bring the healing changes, the Love and Light, to your being.

May God bless you, beloveds. May God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you.
