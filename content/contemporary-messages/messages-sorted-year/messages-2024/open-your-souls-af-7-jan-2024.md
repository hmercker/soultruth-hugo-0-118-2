# Open Your Souls to be Healed

Received by Al Fike 


May the blessings of the Father's Love infill your souls. I come again, I am Bartholomew. I come to assure you that as you receive this great gift of the Father's Love, as your souls open to the holy Touch, the Essence of God, so the impediments of the soul will be healed and dissipate in this gift of Love. 

Each of you have your challenges, your impediments and those aspects of your life that are not altogether in harmony with love. Some you have created these things for yourself and some are merely the outcomes of living in this world. Yet the great invitation of God is to be upheld and transformed in love. These impediments must be released. You must find the freedom of the soul so that you will know joy, you will have wisdom, you will find yourself within the grace of God. 

This is what God wishes for you. God would have you in that grace at every moment, every breath. Yet indeed, these impediments hold you from it. You must focus yourself upon that which is holding you from God. Rather than pray and feel as if you are victimised by the world and all the distractions and imperfections of the world, I urge you  to have faith. Faith is truly that which is the outcome of your knowings and your efforts to be in harmony with all things and within yourself. Faith builds from this. Faith is the strength of the soul that understands the truth. Faith is the outcome of longing and receiving.

In your world it requires  strength and dedication, persistence and desire in order to  disperse the impediments and to be free. Can you imagine what being free would be like for each one of you? Freedom from worry and care. Freedom from need and want. Freedom from all the human conditions that you carry. Freedom from all that which is not of light. My beloved and beautiful friends, we want you to be free, to know the joy everlasting of the soul connected and in relationship with their Creator. This we know. We have gone through the same journey as you. The circumstances may be different within our lives, each unique, as we traveled in the world. Yet we had to overcome. We had to be strong. We had to be strong in our desire to be awakened by God's Love. Now we reap the rewards. We feel and know the freedom and the joy of a soul released from those conditions that are not in harmony with love. 

Each of you are capable of being within that condition of love through your efforts and prayers and faith you have found your freedom. This will come. You must desire this. Have faith in this. Indeed at times be patient and realise that it does take time. It does take effort. The incremental gift of God's Love builds. It does not dissipate ever. It comes drop by drop, day by day, prayer by prayer. As you dedicate yourself to the awakening of your soul and the ultimate freedom from all that is not of love, when you have reached this goal, a goal that is a marker of your progress, then you will look back and say: *"Dear Heavenly Father, with deep gratitude and joy, I acknowledge Your Touch upon me and how you have shown me the way beyond all the impediments, all that which has caused me pain and difficulty, all that is not of love. You have shown me the way to all that is of love and all that is of You. I give You my thanks, my eternal gratitude, my love for You and all that You are."* 

Walk in the world with your head high, your soul glowing in love, knowing that God is with you and you are with God. That all that is beautiful and of God's creation is part of my life, the beauty of a life that knows the truth and expresses the truth with every breath. Each of you has an angel by your side, always. Each of you may avail yourself of this assistance and the touch and love that they give to help uplift you and protect you. God has left out nothing to help you and assist you upon the journey. It is for you to accept and be aware of what is given and to embrace this with all your heart, with all your mind, all your soul, to embrace God and what God has for you in the bountiful flow of His Soul to your soul. 

Be of good cheer, my beloved friends. You have entered upon the path, the path eternal, the path where joy is eternal and grows and evolves beyond anything you can imagine. A path of true knowledge and true understanding of God's universe. A path where you will live for eternity in all that is of light and goodness and love. You have found the blessings  of God's Touch. Never release yourself from this touch, beloved souls. Carry yourself forward to greater heights and glories, deeper knowings and feelings, greater love in all its aspects and expressions. This is given as a gift. This manifests as a result of this gift. You will know the glories of God, the glories of your own being and soul, the glories of a life in alignment with what is of God and God's creation. 

You are loved beyond measure. Drink deep these waters of love. Quench the thirst of the soul. Be in the light, the great peace, the beautiful, beautiful light that is God's Presence.  God bless you. I am Bartholomew and I love you so, precious brothers and sisters of the truth. Know that our commitment to you is eternal, as is your commitment to God. All of us are part of the great march, the journey to at-onement with God, Divinity expressed within us. God bless you all and your brothers and sisters, your families and loved ones. God bless you on this journey. I am Bartholomew and I love you.
