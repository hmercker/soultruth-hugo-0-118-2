# Intention and Will 

February 5<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I come, I am Judas. I’ve been tapping on my brother’s heart these past few hours and letting him know in his soul what I wish to convey this evening and I must say he is somewhat surprised of the message that was picked to be read and the comments of our dear sister because what I wish to speak about is this: *"I wish you to consider the difference between intention and will."* 

It is sometimes said that intention is 9/10ths of the law, and yet I say this, when intention is not acted upon, it has no bearing on the law. For intention is a wish, a desire and coming to God with true desire, deep longing, a real intention is required. 

When one says to you, *"I intend to be there, I intend to make things right, I intend to forge a new path in my life,"* these statements are a desire. This is the form that they come in. When one says *"I will be there, I will pray with you, or even will you pray with me?"* That is an act. 

The intention to act and when intention is acted upon, things change. You bring into being that which was wished for or desired into actuality. So when one actualizes their will from the desire and the intentions of the soul, of the heart, that brings a response. 

These two things, intention and will, bring about not only change but rapport. This occurs in both the natural and the Divine Love. For in the world you can see for instance, when one wishes to become great at something and they actualize their will towards something, that something is created. When this happens regarding one’s soul, when the intention to receive God’s love is actualized by the will in prayer, that love is received. The soul is opened to the infilling and inflowing of the great gift of God’s love.      
   
So it is important to remember these two things going into prayer and I shall state to you that when this happens, there will always be a response from God. For these two things, intention and will, create an opening for God, for His Holy Spirit to come and bring that love to the soul as in this moment, in this circle, and in every circle, where this becomes a reality. 
    
I thank my brother. I thank you all. I shall step back now and allow the love of God to be with us all this evening. I am your brother in Christ, once a misguided soul, and now a redeemed one and an inhabitant of the celestial heavens.
     
May God bless you and may his peace be upon you. I am Judas.
