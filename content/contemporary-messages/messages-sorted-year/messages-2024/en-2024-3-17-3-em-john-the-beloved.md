# A Welcome to This Circle

March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Beloved and I will speak. To those of you who know the Fatherâ€™s Love, open wide and receive more of this blessing into your souls. For there is much more to be had. To those of you who are searching, I say to you, come closer and come closer within this circle that you may feel this love all around you and embracing you and bringing you upward from the condition and conditions within which you live on a daily basis, moment to moment. May you too feel the love flowing to your souls. May you feel uplifted and join your brothers and sisters along this path that brings the greatest joy, the greatest happiness, the greatest love, forever.

Welcome, dear ones, all. Welcome to this circle of love that is here because your Father in Heaven has invited you and you have longed to know the truth. This love, this love is the truth. Wear it in your hearts and souls. Ask for it often. Breathe it in deeply and allow this love to open your souls, to awaken those things within your soul and express this love in all that you do, all that you say, all that you think and all that you be. I am your brother, John, the beloved, and I will step back for my brother at this time. May God bless you all.
