I am your friend, Christine. My beloved brother, time is not so short that you must act on the run. I know you feel you must catch up and be ready. Like an athlete in training, you feel that you must do all that you can to be ready. I understand your impatience, your desire and your anxiousness to have that readiness within you. 

These things take a measure of time and effort, not only on your part, but on ours. There is time, my beloved brother, there is time. You are taking that time. You are putting aside all other distractions and obligations in order to have that time. I wish to assure you that we will utilise that time well. You will know this and understand it. When you come on the other side of this period of time, you will have the insights and understanding as to what was needed, and why and when. You will be reassured with these insights.

My beloved brother, be at peace and know there is time. You have no idea about the events that will unfold, but I assure you that you will be ready when these events do unfold. You will be guided and have great wisdom and understanding as to your role and your light and the capacity that God has set before you and put within you to act as His instrument. But there is a requirement of time and you are willing to set aside that time in order to fulfil this. For this we are grateful. For this we continue to come and walk beside you and truly be your friends. 

There are many, many friends, not just us. But there are bright spirits, Celestial Angels, and, of course, the great Creator of all is on your side as your team that will provide and assist, develop and awaken the many gifts and faculties that you possess. It requires that one crucial ingredient, to receive the great gift of Godâ€™s Love and to walk within that gift, always. 
Be at peace, my son. Do not fret over others who have their path to take, but be at peace.  You will find yourself with deep love and compassion for those who are lost, those who are confused and those who are reticent. May you be blessed in the great Love of God flowing into your souls. All of you, open yourself to this gift and be blessed. Beloved souls, be blessed in love. I am Christine and I love you all.
