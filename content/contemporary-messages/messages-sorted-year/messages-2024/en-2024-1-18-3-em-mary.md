# An Experience of Communion with God

January 18<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Barbados

Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

This is the condition. This is the communion that will keep you safe, close to the Fatherâ€™s love. I am Mary, the Mother as you call me. This is how you will walk in the world. This is how your Father will protect you, by being in this light that is absorbed into your souls. (Being in this light is) also how you got here. So, you may return again and again to this condition. Take each step (in your progression) in this condition of love and light and protection that it affords you. You do it now. You can do it anytime you so choose.

Take this in deeply. Know this as a truth within you. Consider this personal power to come into this condition through communing with God. It is only your will that you need apply and your Father will reach down and touch your very souls. This will help you to help your brothers and sisters. More and more (of them) will be coming to you. So bring your will to this plan, to the Father who orchestrates this for the benefit of all of His children. May the Father bless you intensely, dynamically, completely and of course, so very lovingly. Open and receive your gifts for there are many that are coming. My love is with you. I am Mary.
