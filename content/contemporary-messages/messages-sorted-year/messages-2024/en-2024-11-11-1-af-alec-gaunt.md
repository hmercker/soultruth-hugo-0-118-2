Alec Gaunt received by Al Fike

It is Alec. We are all very pleased that you are willing to take up the torch once again, to help in the development and the journey of each soul that has been invited into this specialised group. It reminds me of my day. There were groups that I conducted that were for beginners. There were groups for those more dedicated. Then there were groups that had purposeful intentions. Of course, this group is very purposeful indeed.

I will be there and many others will be there to help you corral these beautiful souls, help them to focus. God’s blessings will be intense upon all of you. Indeed, this is part of a plan, a plan that is far-reaching. As you continue to open your ears to God’s Will and find your way through this plan, expressing your instrumentality, expressing your gifts for the benefit of those around you, then you will know fulfilment and joy. You will know that sense of purpose and the outpouring of Love that comes with it. You are all blessed, you are all being guided and all who come will be blessed and guided as well.

Yes, there is much work to do. Indeed, this dear and beautiful couple, these instruments, see before them another year of intensity, travel and purposefulness. They will be upheld and in the light. So, as you receive your guidance, continue to plan and orchestrate. Open the doors and the provisions will be there for you to move forward, to be where you are meant to be, to travel where you are meant to travel and to embrace those you are meant to embrace. All these blessings come as the Will of God is manifest in your lives, beloved souls. They shall continue to unfold, often in surprising ways, but delightful ways, blessed ways, loving ways, ways that are in harmony with the Laws of Love. The conditions that bring to you upliftment, protection and guidance are gathered around you always, my beautiful friends.

Yes, we will be there. Yes, those who are meant to come will be there. The way will open. Broadcast your invitation far and wide and you will find that if these individuals are meant to come, the obstructions will be cleared. Again, it is a test of faith, a test of your own ability to receive guidance and to walk along the path that God intends. You will be blessed. You will be blessed. My love is with you.

I am Alec and I love you all. Thank you for continuing the work, for your dedication and your love. So important, so very important. God bless you. My love is with you.
