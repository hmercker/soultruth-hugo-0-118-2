# Living the Truth of Divine Love

November 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Rock Hill, SC, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now. I am John the Beloved and I wish to speak about living the truth of Divine Love in each of your lives. It will look different for each of because each of you is a unique soul but guided by this love that is your soul in transformation. Each of you has characteristics that are, let us say peculiar, or in particular to you. For that is how God made you and when this precious gift of Divine Love enters your souls, it awakens those particular aspects of you. It also moves you to express this love and you are all at a point where this expression, this motivation to express is becoming stronger and more apparent to you. So how do you manage that, so to speak?

You know that prayer will give you the strength, the wisdom, the guidance and your soul will move you in certain directions. Your mind may not be aware of it but it might be a feeling, an intuition, a desire to do something or even not to do something. These are expressions of this love that is transforming your soul. My suggestion to you, each of you, is to not think too hardly about “how to” but rather “be.” That may take some time for you to manifest. So take time, especially now as winter season comes upon you in your part of this world. Take some time to be. Let your mind rest and allow your soul to prompt you, to move you, become familiar with that motivation, that sense of “I feel like doing something.” Become familiar with that, how it feels and sounds to you. This will help you become much more familiar with your soul moving you, rather than your mind or your body.

It’s not difficult. The only difficulty is not listening to what your soul is asking of you, materially, to do. It is time for you to listen to the promptings of your souls and as you join together in these circles of light, allow the Father to pour more and more love into your soul to strengthen those promptings. They will always be subtle but the noise around you will become less. May God bless you. May you find the true path for each of you and my love is with you and I will be with you. You can ask for me whenever you desire. I will be close. I am your brother, John the Beloved and I honor each one of you. God bless you.
