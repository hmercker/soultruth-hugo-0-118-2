Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

The voice of God is in the air, beloved souls. I am Keea Atta Kem. He whispers into your ear giving you the sweet sounds and Truth of His Love. He is close. He is close to each one of you. He knows you by name. He knows you by each and every detail of your being. God is aware of each one and God’s Love for each one is unlimited.

My beloved and beautiful friends, you are loved. You are loved not only by God, but also by the Celestial Angels, the bright spirits, your ancestors, many love you. Many honour you. Know that you are loved. Know that God’s Love is the highest of loves, the greatest of gifts and along with this, His Laws of Attraction for the life that you carry, you draw others who love you so, and many wish to be close, to warm themselves with the light of your soul. Many wish to assist you in your daily life and your efforts to bring light into the world. Many are learning from you as you continue to think and understand, perceive and awaken to the truth.

As you grow, so do those who collect around you, grow. They are drawn to the light, beloveds. You draw yourself to light, the light of God’s Love, the light of His angels coming close, the light of the blessings that are a part and expression of God’s Love for you.

Much is given to each of you, beloveds, though you may not see, hear and know. Within you, you are well aware and you hear the voice of God whispering to you. You know the comfort of God’s Touch enveloping you. You are given much merely because you wish to pray, you long for and you open yourselves to what God has to give to you. You do not need to do much, my beloved friends, other than to pray and go deep within yourself. Feel the longings of your soul and allow them to come forth to God. Feel and know the perceptions, love and life that is within you and express them in your life. Is it that complex, my beloved friends? Indeed, it is not. You find it difficult because of earthly conditions and your own unresolved conditions that are not of love. Yet, within you is the key and the promise that you will be free from these things as you continue to pray, as you continue to long for these blessings.

You come closer to the fountainhead of God’s Love. You are to some degree free of the conditions that are not of God. As you continue to yearn, pray, work and strive toward light, the freedom is felt. It becomes more intense and becomes an awakened part of yourself, knowing and feeling the expansion of love within, knowing and feeling the Love of God for you, knowing and feeling the love you have for your brothers and sisters. This is what your world needs, my beloveds, and you are answering God’s call to be a part of that great upflow that will, in time, change the world and bring peace and love.

You are a part of this, beloveds. You shall be in accordance with your dedications and efforts as you step forth in the world and be that channel of love. You will be given all that you require to do so. All that you require will assist you upon the road of service and light as God answers your prayers and your longings to be His instrument in the world. May you be blessed, beloveds, blessed deeply and broadly, blessed powerfully and joyfully in the Divine Touch, His Holy Spirit conveying God’s great Love that comes to you on the heels of prayer. God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you. I love you so. God bless you.
