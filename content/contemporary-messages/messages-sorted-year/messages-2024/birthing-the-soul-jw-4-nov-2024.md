# Birthing the Soul

My dear brothers and sisters, it is I Judas your Celestial friend and brother. 
 
I have spoken before about the three births. The first entering the human condition and the second entering the spirit world. The third, of course, is being transformed into a celestial soul. There has been much relayed to you about the soul, about prayer to receive the great gift of God’s love, and about trusting your heart. 
    
You may wonder when reading what has been written about the life of the Master, why he chose the term *“being born again”,* to describe what is required to enter the Kingdom of God.  Why not use the word transformation, for is that not what occurs to the soul? 

One could compare a mother having a real knowledge of carrying a soul referred to as a quickening in the womb to a soul receiving the love of God experiencing a quickening in its being as if a light bulb has been turned on. And this has been described, as a glowing in the heart and solar plexus. For a real substance has entered the soul and can be felt. 

Perhaps each one uniquely senses this as being a new creation. In both cases of giving birth, there are periods of intensity, of labor, to bring into being something new.  When you begin to have this soul quickening you start to attract Celestial spirits; Divine Angels to guide you, and this is a very different kind of guidance. This is not to say that when you require material help, physical healing, safety, and so forth there are not beautiful blessed progressive spirits to help you, for there are. 

But as a soul on the path of divine love, you bring celestial intervention, and your guidance begins to be soul to soul rather than perhaps a wonderful intuition of the mind. We call this soul perception. When you are in the stillness of this prayer our influence can be very strong and very beneficial to each one for, we come for all.  And in our oneness in God’s love, each one can help another. Each one can be lifted. 
 
So I wish to remind you wherever you are to take a moment to be still. To reach out from your soul to the soul of God. To open your heart that your soul may receive and inform your life. Be not afraid in these troubled times but stay in grace, in peace, and in the love of God as we guide you every step of the way. 
 
How we love you only heaven knows. I shall step back, and I thank you for this time together. 
   
May God’s love fill every soul, touch every heart, and bring you great joy. I am your happy Celestial brother and eternal friend in God’s love. I am Judas. Go in peace.
