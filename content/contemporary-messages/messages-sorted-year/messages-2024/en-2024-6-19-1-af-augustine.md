Augustine received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I commend you on your efforts, the harmony that has ensued from your efforts. I also want to stress that in order to do God’s work, you must continue to apply yourselves in ways that are overt, that are a reflection of God’s Will. You cannot merely speak of these things and feel the job is done. I know you understand this well. But in your culture, in the way you are in the world today, often it is the voice, the verbalization, the writing down of words that reflect the work. But I say to you, beloved souls, that it is the actions of the soul in relationship with God that does the work.

These other ideas and efforts are a requirement of your modern life. Indeed, I do not wish to dissuade you from this. But in fact, what you do with your bodies, your spirits and your souls in relation to others is what is the crucial and most important part of this work. So, it is good that you formulate your ideas and your concepts and you have clarity in your minds as to what is important and what is not. It is the expression of love, it is the continued awakening of your soul, it is all that is part of God’s plan and God’s intentions for you that is of the utmost importance. The mindful things have their place in your world and we cannot circumvent these obligations and conditions, but they must have their place in a way that brings harmony and the fulfilment of your true purpose, your true abilities, your true soulful longings to serve God.

Be that light in the world, beloved souls. Walk in the world with your eyes wide open to the Will of God, and the actions and guidance that come with this awareness. To speak of things is good, but to merely speak of things accomplishes very little. To act upon that which you speak of indicates integrity, desire and faith that the Love within your soul is manifesting in the world in various ways and means. Be that loving instrument, a channel of Love, God’s instrument of healing and warmth, embracing others, moving in the world as a light, touching other souls as God’s channel. These things are of the utmost importance and so, we encourage you along those lines. We encourage you to think of these things that you might do to serve God.

Yes, the ways of man must be served, but the ways of God are higher and require more attention. This is what I wish to say to you today, beautiful students of truth. I wish to say that to know your own soul and to know the Will of God is to be God’s instruments and to fulfil all else, all requirements, all that is necessary. Be that light and live that light and you will find yourself fully awakened in the Truth of God’s Love, fully in service of the Will of God’s plan, fully in the joy of living within this Light of Truth and Love.

May you be blessed. Your teacher, Augustine, continues to stand with you, as do many. You will find your ways and means to accomplish your tasks. God will provide avenues and opportunities to do so. Think of yourself collectively as instruments of God, a body of light and truth, service for the good of humanity. How this will be accomplished will be learned day by day, step by step. Indeed, plans that you make now may not be fulfilled later. But at least you are thinking about the direction, about the future, about how you might serve. This is important, because when your thoughts are clear and open, then the Will of God may manifest in a conscious way through you. You will find yourself moving within the flow, that great river of His Will rather than that which is of the human will and condition.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, in the Truth and Light and Love of our Creator, continuing to walk on the path provided, continuing to absorb the truth given, the guidance proffered by God to you. You will find yourself living in such a way that may be contrary to your expectations, but are in alignment with God’s expectations. May you be blessed, beloved souls, truly blessed. God bless you. My love is with you. I appreciate each of you and your efforts to serve. This shall evolve and grow in Love. God bless you.
