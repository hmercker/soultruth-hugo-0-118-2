# The Way of the Soul’s Journey

I am Seretta Kem. I come to assure you that even though there may be some fundamental changes in your life, they will be for the better. You will benefit from what may happen in your lives that will unfold in accordance to God’s plan, in accordance to your own soul’s desires to awaken to your gifts and your destinies.

Change often doesn’t happen overnight in this world of yours. It is tempered by human will and the human condition, but change will invariably become an outcome of your soul’s progression. As your soul is transformed in love, so that which you desire, that which excites you and motivates you will change with this fundamental shift of consciousness. When you align yourself with God and God’s Will and walk along a path that is designated by God, then there is harmony. Much falls into place readily and you are given insight and guidance as to what direction and action you must take.

Much of this guidance will come unexpectedly, but you will find yourself drawn and compelled to enact this guidance. For your soul knows its journey and its purpose. As you continue to enliven your soul with the great gift of Divine Love, then that realisation comes to you. It may come to you in many different forms through many different avenues, but it will come nonetheless. As you hear your guidance either spoken to you within your own mind, or given to you through another, or some sign, or some vision, you will know its validity. You will understand that it is truly a blessing from God. God will show you the way to enact these things, and indeed, as you continue to pray and ask for guidance, so it will come accordingly. 

You must be receptive, beloved souls, open, trusting, of great faith. Yet if you sit and wait for something to manifest for you, it will take some time for this to happen, and there will be situations where it would never happen. If you are active, an active partner with God, seek out God’s guidance and enact it in the best way you can, even if you fail with your actions, it will lead you another step toward what is meant to be and unfold in your life. All that you have done thus far is a step, another step along the path you are meant to take. 

As you absorb the guidance, and it becomes strong, personal, and unequivocal in your thinking, in your perception, in your desires, then you will indeed be motivated. You will find a way as you step forward just as these two beautiful souls have travelled the world in faith and have asked to be guided and indeed, when guidance comes they act upon it. Thus the unfolding of their lives has been remarkable and filled with opportunities to serve God. They did not plan the journey. Rather they asked for the plan to unfold and it did step by step. Thus this is a good example of what might be accomplished with faith, prayer and desire.

Their journey has not been a perfect one. There have been times when they faltered, but indeed a great deal of what they have done has been blessed and a great accomplishment. They are known by many in the world, and they will continue to be known by many, and many more. For when you ignite that first step, when you walk the road as they have, then one thing will lead to another, will lead to another, until you find yourself in the midst of service, a service you may not have even anticipated or desired. Yet, it is before you in accordance with God's Plan. Because of this, you will feel the rightness of its unfolding and its manifestation.

None of you here are ignorant of this fact and truth. To be an active agent for God, one must act and be willing to be God’s channel, God’s Instrument in the world. There is nothing that would hold you back from this, beloved souls, only your mind in doubt, only the ideas and structures of the paradigm of your own thinking and expectations. I urge you to release that which is not in harmony with God’s Laws and God’s Will and to seek out God’s Will. Seek out that which is meant to be within your life and to act upon it. It requires going beyond the measures of your mind to that which is deeper, that which is alive, that which glows within you. 

If this is a problem, a difficulty in your life, then you know that’s where you must focus your efforts, your prayers, to dig deeper within yourself and find the way that you long to know and to enact. Your souls long for this. Your souls have been blessed with the capacity, ability and gifts to do so. Seek out God. Seek out your soul. We cannot do this for you. It is for you to struggle and find your way. It will not be accomplished until you have made efforts to the very last thought, prayer and desire to be with God and to be in harmony with God’s Laws of Love. Let go of that which holds you back and embrace that which brings you forward with all the beauty and wonderment of a soul finding its rightful place within your consciousness. It is not an impossible task. It is not a task that has been asked of you that you cannot perform. It is a task that awaits your efforts and desire. 

God waits for you beyond the impediments, beyond the conditions that hold you back. God draws you forward. God continues to bless you. Indeed, you will find your way, beloved souls. You will continue to do so until that place of enlightenment and awakening that you so desire to have and experience will be yours, but it does require effort and application of the truth. It does require your steadfastness, your tenacity and your faith.

May you be blessed, my beloved friends. I am Seretta Kem, and I come to encourage you and instruct you on the ways of the soul. I shall continue to do so as you progress, so more will come in truth, in guidance, in blessings. God bless you beloved friends. My love is with you. God bless you.
