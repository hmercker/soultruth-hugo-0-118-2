# Focus Upon Your Prayers

March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

 Online Prayer Circles, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Beloved & Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

**John:** I am here with you all now, brothers and sisters. I am John the Beloved. I come to pray with you, to uplift you, as do many here, including our Master, who is present, who brings blessings from our Father to bestow upon each one of you.

It is with great joy that we do so come and pray with the children on the Earth, for this Earth is lacking in the kind of love that the Father desires to be present upon it. When you come together, as you do in deep, sincere prayer, aspiring to God, lifting your longings to God and your love to God, then God responds and brightens not only your souls but the world.

You have much work to do. We ask that you focus upon your prayers and your service and let God direct you every step of the way. We will be with you. We are always with you. The Master wishes to speak.

**Jesus:** My beloved brothers and sisters, yes, I am Jesus, the Master of the Celestial Heavens. I bring to you a message from our Father in the highest of heavens, whose Love pours down upon you at this time.

You are so beloved. You are so encased in His Love. There should be no fear, no worry. Stay in tune, in rapport, with God at every moment and, moment to moment. You will be guided, uplifted and shrouded in His Love. You may trust our Father, for His Love is great and powerful. It belongs in your souls. Open, dear children of the Earth. Open wide and receive the blessings that God has for you.

May God bless you deeply, truly and completely. I am your brother, Jesus. My love is with you and the Father's Love is with you. God bless you. May your souls brighten, may your lives brighten, may the truth reside within you and may you share it with all with whom you come into contact. God bless you. God bless you, dear ones, children of the future Earth. God bless you.
