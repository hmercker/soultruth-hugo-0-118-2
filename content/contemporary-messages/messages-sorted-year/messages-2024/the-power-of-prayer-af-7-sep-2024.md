Received by Al Fike 

May the Father’s Love be upon you my beloved souls, children of the truth. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to welcome you in this Circle of Light, to be with you in prayer and to help reinforce the light and conditions of love in this circle, this corner of light. Remember that it takes great effort and power to bring the angels into your midst. Each of you is an active agent in this regard, for we rely upon your prayers and your desires to bring this about, to bring us close. This is a response from God as you open yourselves, your longings to your Creator and be blessed by the great Love of God through the Holy Spirit that comes. Open yourselves to this inflowing of the Essence of God, the Living Waters, the Great Flame, whatever way you feel and know this.

It is important that you know and that you feel. That you are attuned to this holy blessing upon you. That you become a light, truly a light in alignment with God. That you are at peace, for it is within the peace that the light might flow out through you to others. It is in the joy that you come to recognise the power and the glory of the Father’s Touch upon you. It is in that sense, that revelation, that the soul that you possess is a unique creation of God. A beautiful jewel beyond price that is your true self yearning for awakening, yearning for at-onement with God. We lift you up, beloved souls. We lift you up beyond the conditions of this earthly plane into that Hall of Peace, that beautiful light where your souls may feel refreshed and that you may come to know this refreshment, this awakening that comes from the Touch of God upon you, His Holy Love infilling you.

We come together, your angel friends and you with your friends, seeking the grace of God, replenishing yourself spiritually and knowing the great peace that comes as God’s Hand is upon you, beloveds. We lift you up. God showers you with His Love. We are in that place of Holy Communion, the power of love transforming your soul and making it into what it is meant to be. A holy, unique and transformed creature of God’s great creation expressing all its unique qualities and beautiful gifts, consciously and palpably in the world. Breathe in the love, beloved souls. Allow it to infuse you and expel all that is not of love, releasing all conditions that are of darkness, healing the body and spirit, transforming the soul that we are in that place Divine. 

It is yours for the taking, my beloveds. It is yours for the asking. Be with us, together in this Holy Love and communion with God, and you will know the joy of it, the peace and all that comes with love. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I love you so. Beautiful children of God, I love you so. God bless you.
