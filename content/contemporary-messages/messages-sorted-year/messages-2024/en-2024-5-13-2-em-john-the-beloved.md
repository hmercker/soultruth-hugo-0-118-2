# Your Desires and Longings to Be At-One with God Will Create a Strong Connection With Him

May 13<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Rock Hill, SC, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now. I am John the Beloved, and I come to pray with you, yes, to strengthen your prayers. For the Father desires a strong connection with each one of His children. Your desires, your longings to be at one with God will create that strong connection. You know He loves you and how much, you cannot possibly know but He is building a connection with you every time you seek His love, every time you allow His grace to touch you, every time you set aside your Earthly concerns and are present with God that bond of love is strengthened. This is why we encourage to spend time with God, that you may know your steps clearly when you are in rapport with your Heavenly Father.

Let your longings become stronger and frequently pray to the Father and your path will be clear to you who walk it. God bless you. I am your brother, John the Beloved and I will remain with you while you pray as will many of my brothers and sisters who are here to support you and to love you and uplift you.
