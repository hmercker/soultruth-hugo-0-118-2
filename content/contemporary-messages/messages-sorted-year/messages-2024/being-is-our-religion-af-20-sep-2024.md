My friends, beautiful souls of Earth, lights, souls shining forth, I am Christine. I’m here to remind you that there are many different beings who are here to assist and uphold all of you in your endeavours, in your desires to progress spiritually. God has asked and implored many to come to help those on the Earth as you continue to struggle in this Earthly condition.

We are here to help clear the way, to help bring you to a place of joy, light and peace. These things are powerful elements for any being on any planet in order to be in harmony with the laws of creation. 

Unfortunately humanity doesn’t even know what creation is. They think their existence is the result of many random acts in the universe creating this miracle of a human being. Yet those with eyes that can see, minds that can think and souls that can perceive, realise that creation is not a random act. It is an act of the fulfilment of Love, the Love of God, made manifest in the material world and the spirit world and the many, many layers of existence that go on infinitely, intricately and beautifully.

In time, when you are spiritually advanced and developed with your soul’s perceptions well awakened by love, you will be able to have a glimpse of what I speak of, these many layers, these many, many elements of existence that come into being, not in a random way but in a devised and planned way, leading forward in harmony and development. The direction of creation is always toward greater harmony and more diversity. These things will come into your consciousness as you are ready, if you are interested and you pursue this information about creation, about the more subtle laws of creation, about the more subtle laws that determine your condition, physically, spiritually, mentally will come to you and you will find answers to questions you might have. You will find yourself immersed in the harmony of God’s creation.

This journey, this eternal journey you are on as you continue to seek to develop your soul with the blessings of the Essence of the Creator. There will be many insights and  deeper understanding, greater love and peace, harmony, so much given by the Creator to uphold His precious souls whether those souls be on this planet or another. We are all related. We are all brothers and sisters in this wondrous creation of God.

You may think that the way in which I speak to you and the language I use might indicate a development of religious ideas and attitudes on my planet, but this is not really the truth. Of course, I must use this instrument and the language that he possesses in order to communicate. But in truth, there is no religion. There is being, being in light, being in truth. Thus there is no need for a structure of understanding because each individual develops their own framework through their own personal experience. This is what you need to teach, my friends. You need to help others go to God with innocence, with desire, with longing and see for themselves what is true and to know for themselves the power of love, the wonderment of love and to live this in their own way along their own personal path toward enlightenment.

My friends there is so much for you to learn and know. There is so much in the universe that awaits your explorations and your understanding. God does not restrict the flow of learning and truth to the individual. Rather, God opens doors, opens the avenue for this understanding. When you are prepared, when your perceptions are keen and clear, when you have Love Divine within you, then there are no elements to hold you back, merely the conditions that you carry, the biases that you have within your mind that restrict your ability to see clearly, to understand deeply. Indeed,  these obstructions will fall away in time and you will marvel at the intricacies of the universe and how all is in harmony and all is in relationship toward harmony. This is the wonderment of creation. This is the beauty of creation and you will come to know this, perceive it and experience it for yourself.

May you be blessed with a great inflowing of the Essence of the Creator, His Love flowing forth abundantly, transforming you and opening up the perceptions that you require to understand life, to appreciate the universe and to know it, to truly know it. May you be blessed, my friends. I am Christine and I love you, each one, beautiful creations of God, brothers and sisters of mine. I am happy to be here, to share with you a moment in prayer and to be in the light you draw close to you in your prayers. God bless you, beloved ones. I love you.
