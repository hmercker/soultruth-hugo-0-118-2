# Your Gifts Will Manifest in Ways Unexpected

October 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike 

I come once again to speak to you. I am Orion. I have such tender feelings of love for each one of you. Beautiful souls, yearning for greater soul progression and awakening. That which only comes with the inflowing of the Essence of the Creator of all the universe, this highest Love given, a gift, a substance that is of the soul.

As you continue to progress, you will find yourself entering into arenas and situations that you would not have imagined yourself to be in. For as you progress, as your souls continue to awaken, as the potentials of your souls continue to be realised and expressed,  God will use you in ways that may seem impossible to you now. Yet, as you change and are transformed by this great gift, by the efforts that are made between many of us, those stellar friends, angel friends and bright spirits, you will be changed. For rather than refining solely your bodies and your minds, it will be your spirits and your souls that will be changed, refined and transformed into something truly beautiful, magnificent and powerful in its scope.

When you come close to this condition that I speak of, this beautiful state of being, then many doors will begin to open for you. Many individuals, whom you do not anticipate having connections and relationships with, will come into your lives. God will guide them to you and, as you open and are receptive to guidance,  you will make the steps necessary to make that rapport or that connection with them. You will have something to give that they recognise and are drawn to. Many of these individuals are already accomplished in their material life, their material gifts and mindful gifts, but they seek something else. They seek connection with something deeper, because they realise that beyond these accomplishments that are so acknowledged by the material world, they desire simply more and deeper.

Because they have the wherewithal, the mental capacities and the physical capacities to realise their goals when it comes to spirituality, which they will discover, they will be adamant in their pursuit. They will seek out those blessings and those individuals that they feel drawn to, not by their minds, but their souls. Thus your numbers will grow and there will be many interesting and intriguing individuals who will come into your midst. Accomplished as they are, they are still babes in the woods when it comes to their spiritual accomplishments and awakening.

This is where you are needed, my friends, to teach, to demonstrate and to show the way. You must be pure and in alignment and not distracted, but strong in the light, in the Love of God and the Truth of God. Not strong in the way of mental understanding and intellectual formulations of this truth, for this will not bring these individuals I speak of to you. It is your light, your humility and your demonstration of these truths that will draw these individuals forth. God will ensure that they are aware of you, that opportunities will come to you that will make your presence more public than it is now.

I know some of you feel unready for this. Some of you eagerly embrace it and yet the majority of you are somewhat neutral in this regard. Yet, all of you are needed and you need to support one another in this, for it is not easy to step forward into the world and say, "I am a child of God. I know the greatest blessing of all the universe and I want to show you and teach you the ways that you may also receive this blessing." Those who are sceptical will see you as lacking in credibility, not having the acknowledgements and the accolades of those who are well known in your society and culture.

Yet, this is the time where you will demonstrate the truth and, indeed, manifest the truth. For when the time is ripe, when the crowds are gathered, it is not your words that will convince them. It is the manifestation of your light, the blessings that will come through you and around you. As you gather in numbers to bring these demonstrations forward, to teach with a sense of authority and confidence, then others will listen. Of course, many will turn away. They do not want to know the truth. They are quite satisfied living the life that they live and seeing the world as they see it. Yet, those who are seeking, and there are many, will seek you out and you will seek them out through your efforts, guided and strong. Your light will glow and shine. Your humility and grace will be obvious. The words that you speak will be simple, yet will glorify the truth. This combination of expression through you, in you and around you will draw the interest of those that see you as unique and different. They will be curious and they will desire to know more.

So, we ready you for these times that are coming sooner than you might think. These times rely upon a window where you are able to travel and move around in the world easily. That you are able to plant the seeds where others are eager to receive them and to know them. So, my beloved friends, your influence will spread far and wide. Each one of you has something unique to offer to the world. Each one of you is gifted. Each one of you knows the truth and is growing in the truth. So God nurtures His garden of beautiful souls and God will continue to ensure that the transformation within will take place, provided you are dedicated in your efforts to change your soul in love.

Have faith in your future, my friends. I have great faith in your future. Many have great faith in your future, but we are not physically upon this plane of yours. Therefore, we rely upon you and your physicality, your presence, your membership in the society of humans, to do the work for us. Though, in time, when the conditions are right, I and many of my cohorts will manifest and support you. But first, the initial outpouring of truth, of effort, must be yours. This is part of the plan, the Divine plan, and you must be ready and indeed eager, seeking out not fame and fortune, but seeking out the opportunities to serve and to be God's humble servants, in loving grace, in harmony and peace. For without demonstrating these qualities, you will be an inadequate servant for God.

God wants you to be that beautiful servant, that beautiful being that He knows you are capable of. For He has put within you all the capacities, all the gifts and abilities that will make this so. God, above all beings, knows the future, knows what is coming and has His plan at the ready. We, all of us, including those of us who are far advanced within our souls' progression, must have faith in what God knows to be the future and what God plans to meet the future with opportunities, especially on this earthly plane, but in all the universe as well, to bring greater harmony, greater love and greater light.

My beautiful friends, I ask you to humbly seek out the blessings of God, the guidance given and acknowledge the changes within. In this acknowledgement, you encourage them and you help to open the doors for them to manifest upon your earthly plane. Rather than keep them hidden and not trust in their beautiful expression, it is important for you to attempt to manifest, to speak, to reach out and to be that light. Each little effort will grow into larger and larger efforts, until that realisation of the great potential that is your soul manifesting light will come and be seen by many.

May you continue to seek out the guidance and the blessings. May you continue to be strong in faith and love. May you continue to see this earthly life not as a challenge to overcome every and all material obstacles, but to be that being filled with grace that moves fluidly through the world without the distractions and challenges weighing you down. Be free, beloved souls. Be free and be alive in all that is you, the oneness of your being, manifest in light and love, the light of your being indicating the growth that you have endured to make and have put great effort into its manifestation. Be true to God's Will. All else will follow. May it be blessed. Orion loves you. May you be blessed.



**Augustine Affirms Orionâ€™s Message (2024 Direct Voice)**


We have talked of impediments many times. Conditions that you carry, attitudes that are unloving and do not acknowledge your own beautiful beings, how much you are loved and how much you may love yourself and others. These things have been repeated so many times. Yet, I wish to affirm with you that these conditions are dissipating. As you continue to receive the great gift of God's Love and as we continue to assist you in growing in that Love, these conditions are dissipating. Indeed, those judgments will fall away, that harshness of the mind will give way to a subtlety and a softness that is beautiful, reflecting your own soul, which is in light.

This must happen because the laws regarding transformation and progression will ensure the manifestation of these things. The light will come. Peace will come to you. Wisdom and joy will come to you. The capacity to love others and yourself will grow exponentially. You are on the cusp of this, beautiful souls. Our friend Orion speaks of it and I have come to affirm it with you all.

Be eager for the days ahead. Be sure of your journey and your progress. Continue to seek out the Love of God with all your enthusiasm, desire and yearning. In this way, what I speak of will not be inhibited, but will come clearly, resolutely, powerfully and harmoniously to you all.

God bless you, beloved friends, students of truth. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I too love you, beautiful souls that you are. God bless you.
