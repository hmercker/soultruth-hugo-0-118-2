# The Activation of God’s Love Will Bring Many Blessings and Changes in You

February 11<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Your souls are being activated by the great blessing of the Father’s Love. Do you see what this means in your life? How, indeed, you are drawn to the Light like moths to the flame and you flutter all around the great Soul of God in anticipation, desiring this blessing, the warmth of His Light and Love entering you, changing you, making you glow and filled with Light. The activation of this Love will bring forth many gifts and blessings to you and your life.

You will see a change within you, a change of attitude, a change of desires. Rather than be caught up in the desires of the flesh and the material desires that come with this, which are so predominant in your world, you, in a subtle way, become free and less concerned with these issues and conditions that are so prevalent. You begin to see your life from a different perspective regarding the flow and intention of your life. You begin to see that this life that you have on the earthly plane is but one chapter in many that are a part of your existence.

For you existed within the womb of God not fully conscious in this way. Now you have been given the fleshy body and the material existence to experience life in its own unique ways. In time, you will progress into the world of spirit, sloughing off this material body and living a life that is more a reflection of the soul and the spirit. In time, you will progress into the Celestial Kingdom where even the spirit body is of no great consequence, for this is a place of pure soul awakened and enlivened by the touch of God.

As you progress through these phases of life, your experience and perspective changes. You begin to see things from a deeper place, that of the soul. You begin to perceive things from that place of soul wisdom, soul understanding. You will come to an awakening that is profound. An awakening that starts deep within yourself as you have been blessed and continue to be blessed by the Father’s Love. This great blessing shall warm your soul and begin its great work of transformation within.

As you begin to perceive this transformation, feel its power, feel its influence upon you, all that you are and all that you express in the world will change accordingly. Though you have the great impediment of the mind that continues to put parameters and limitations on this, in time you will be freed from these limitations and know the true possibilities of the expansion of the soul. Our hope is that you will do so in the material world as you have your fleshy body. For God needs instruments who are without these limitations and barriers of thought, where the individual can rely upon the wisdom and thoughts of the soul.

Can you imagine what you might do unbridled by mindful considerations? Can you imagine the light that you would be, shining forth and becoming God’s true instruments, pure and beautiful? You have one shiny example to look upon, your beloved brother, Jesus, who was that light in the world. Yet, he said that you may do this also. So, we come to encourage you upon that particular path of service, light and truth. Indeed, you shine forth at this time. As our beloved Keea has mentioned, you are a light. That light shall become brighter.

You, my beloved friends, students of truth, will become more effective and powerful instruments in the world. God will guide you. God will show you the way so that you may truly shine forth in all your unique and beautiful soulful self. We look forward to that day. We pray for that day to be realised within each one of you. We seek out ways and means of helping to accelerate this change within you, helping you to accept this new self that emerges, helping you to truly understand your soul. In doing so, understand God.

All these things are made available to you for the asking, given abundantly, showing you the way with harmony, love, peace and joy. May you find your way, truly find your way. We look forward to your continued progress. Keep praying, beloveds, for the Love. Keep accepting what may be at times difficult adjustments within you. They are meant to be, in order to clear out the debris of a life lived in the material way, but a life that yearns to live in the way of the soul.

May you be blessed, my beloved and beautiful students. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I love you dearly, each one of you, each one. The Master comes to bless you, each one. He travels from place to place around your world touching you and blessing you. My hope is that you will feel the warmth and love of his touch upon you as you continue to seek out the great blessings of God’s great Soul. God bless you. God bless you.
