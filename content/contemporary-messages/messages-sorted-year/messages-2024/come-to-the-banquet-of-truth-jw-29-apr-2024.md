It is I, your brother, Judas. There are many wishing to come forward tonight and so I shall begin. In this circle of love, in the protection of heaven, in the grace of God, each soul can be filled, each heart can be healed. My dear brothers and sisters you have taken the time out of the world to come into this rapport, not only with the celestial kingdom, but with the very soul of God, in the longings of your souls.
    
Out in the world, it may seem like a giant marketplace, everyone selling one thing or another. Everyone vying for your attention is so prevalent, one could call it ‘the grand seduction’. Do you wish to be beautiful? Do you wish to be rich? Do you wish to be loved? Do you wish to find yourself? Do you wish to be powerful? Do you wish to be heard? All these voices clamoring for your attention. And of course, every soul, at the bottom of it, needs love. At the core, I should say. Every soul reaching is out. And so, as many of you know, you can try this one or that one, this or that teacher, an ancient process, or a brand new something, and yet the hunger in your souls is not satisfied, whether it be through indulging the simple materialism that pervades the world, or the popular spiritual materialism.  Many here have seen the failure of those paths and stepped out and into this circle, into your relationship with your Creator in prayer, opening your heart, opening your soul, and listening to the small still voice that comes in truth, that comes in God’s love that says, “Ask and it will be given to you”. 
     
Let go of those things that bind you, for they are not real. Give your heart to God in the great romance of Divine Love and all those things, those material things will no longer have any weight. Join us at the great banquet of truth, at the magnificent feast of God’s love, satiating every hunger, every need, every soul with ( Divine Love) the very substance of the Creator. 
   
Believe me, all of us here who wrap our arms around you and our souls know the difficulties of navigating through this world that you live in and yet, as has been said many times, this simple prayer offered up in the humbleness of knowing that God is the provider is always answered and the promise of transformation, being lifted, being changed is fulfilled in answer to your simple request. And if you can imagine God smiling in the effulgence of His light and love upon you, then you can imagine your walk into the future. 
   
I shall step back in this beautiful circle. You are so loved. You are so cared for. Know that you are protected and that we love you. I am your brother and friend, in Christ. I am Judas.
