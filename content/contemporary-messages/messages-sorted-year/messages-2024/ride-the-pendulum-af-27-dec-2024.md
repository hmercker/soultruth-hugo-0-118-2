# Ride the Pendulum of God’s Blessings Toward the Light 

December 27<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Received by Al Fike 

May the blessings of the Father's Love pour into your soul in great abundance, that you may know the transformative effects of this gift that God has given humanity, that you may demonstrate the power and beauty of this gift in your own person and expression. I am Michael Collier. I have not spoken to you for some time, yet I was with this instrument today. He thought of me and I have made a rapport.

The year to come will have its challenges but will also have its opportunities. Indeed, the climate will continue to react to the imbalance that is being impressed upon it by levels of CO2 and other elements that affect how weather is created and expressed on your Earth. This will be a challenge for many, although I do not see anyone here who will be directly challenged to the point of great hardship. Each of you, however, will need to adjust in your own way.

There will be great ups and downs regarding social order, social disorder and economic disorder. Many things that affect your daily life will not remain in their usual mode of smooth sailing but will react to governments implementing various political and economic interventions to, in their minds, remedy the situation. This too will affect you all in some way.

In terms of spirituality, there are some who will continue to ride the pendulum toward light and many who will ride the pendulum toward darkness. This is not so new to you, but the intensity of these conditions will continue to be felt and applied to the human condition. God is continuing to bless you all with many energetic flows and impressions upon the Earth.

You will feel the benefit of these things, even though the conditions of the Earth are worsening. You are attuning yourself to that which is counteractive toward these dark conditions, that which God is blessing each and every one of you with, even though many do not feel it, experience it or even benefit at times. You, my beloved friends, know how to benefit from these blessings, how to be in alignment with God's Will and plan and how to know the blessings of God's Love and all its wonderment and gift to you.

It is for you to be steadfast, to not follow that pendulum swing toward darkness, but to resist and to be on that upswing toward light, to make that choice each and every day with each and every thought and each and every moment. It is for you to be in harmony with light and love, the grace of God touching you and to have your feet sure and planted upon the Divine Path. Put aside any distractions, doubts, fears, or thoughts that are not in harmony with this, for you are the one in control here. You are the one that makes the decisions. You are the one who acts. It is your life and God has given you independence. God does not tell you what to do. God gives you the will to choose. 

So it is for you for this coming year to make those choices that are in harmony with creation, with the Laws of Love, with your own well-being physically, mentally, spiritually, to be in that harmony that is life. It is possible, even though all around you may be disharmony. You, beloved souls who know the laws and know how to enact the laws in your own life, may choose harmony, may feel, know and express harmony. I encourage you to walk the path of harmony, to walk the path of truth, to walk the path that expresses love in all its myriad forms and all its beauty and wonderment. 

God is there always, does not forsake you ever, but is there always for you. He sends His angels also to be with you. He sends His Holy Spirit and all blessings that flow from this available to you at all times. There is no moment when you cannot open yourselves to the blessings of Light, Love and harmony. It is there for you at this very moment. It is there for you at every moment. Remember this in your consciousness whenever there is duress, whenever your thoughts drift toward that which is not in harmony with love and light, that you might change this. You have the power to do so. You have the knowledge to do so. Indeed, you have the light within your soul and it is our hope that it dictates everything that you do and everything that you think. 

My beloved friends, it is time to be responsible and to be empowered with truth, to walk in the world as a light, for the world desperately needs your light, God's Light, all the blessings of light that can come and flow through you and flow through many to help uplift the world. You are God's instruments. You have been developed, awakened, guided, taught, protected and loved deeply. All these things work in your favour. All these things will help reinforce and strengthen the flow of love and light through you, of truth spoken and of actions given in harmony. It is for you to choose this and to be this.

So, I reinforce what you already know, that indeed to be empowered in life and love, you must choose to be in alignment with these things and act upon them with all your deliberation, desire and efforts to be that light for God, to be that channel of love for God that benefits your brothers and sisters. So much awaits to flow through you, to you and around you. Take advantage of every moment, every day, to be in that light and harmony, to truly express it and be it in all its beauty, in all its forms and in all the blessings that might come.

God bless you, my friends. I am Michael Collier and I am happy to speak to you today. Indeed, I shall speak to you in the future. May your blessings continue to flow. May your light continue to be a light. God bless you, beloved friends. My love is with you. God bless you.
