I come, I am your brother and your friend. I am Jesus. Do not doubt me, but come close, for we are truly brothers and sisters in the Love of God. For those who would denigrate me, have compassion. For those who have the challenge of believing and understanding that I might come to you, be gentle and loving. 

I do not seek recognition. I do not seek that others may truly come to understand me in as much as my person, or my presence. I merely come to reinforce and awaken humanity to the Truth of God’s Love, that each individual must come to know God.  In coming to know me, there is a measure of a benefit. But to come to know God creates the foundation of true spiritual understanding, that they may empower themselves with the gifts and blessings that God has for them.
I am merely your brother. I have walked the Earth as you walk the Earth. I found my way to the Celestial Heavens and have assisted God in opening up those Heavens. That has been my task and shall always be my task, to help my brothers and sisters come to the glory of His Love. My purpose is not to show others that which holds them from God, for that may be given in the blessings of God’s Love to them and in their own insights and relationship with God. Allow each individual to find their way upon this treacherous path, one that has been obstructed by many conditions that are a part of your life. 

Yet you will find your way, beloved souls. Each of you have found your way, though I know that within your hearts and your minds you wish for more, deeper, broader, more fulfilling experiences with God. At this time it is more of a struggle than a fulfilment for many of you, but still you persist, beloveds, still you persist. In this you will find your way. You will be blessed deeply. You will know me and know God, and know many angel friends and bright spirits, even those who do not reside upon this planet. There is a whole universe waiting for each one of you. That universe can be discovered and recognised by the perceptions of the soul. In this way, as God continues to nourish you and transform you with His Love, then these perceptions will awaken, your experiences will deepen and broaden, you will truly know truth.

For this time in your life, which is full of challenges and distractions, and conditions that are not conducive for soul awakening, you must struggle through. Some find it easier than others, but all must apply themselves to the truth of love, to the expression of love, to the journey of discovering the highest blessing of Love, which is from God. Yet you have much support, much love poured upon you, much light around you, much protection. All good things, all blessings from God are given freely and abundantly to each one of you. Seek this, beloved souls, seek these blessings. Seek to be with God. Seek to be within your soul and know that place deep within. Be familiar with this and love that place within you that is without the impediments of the mind and is clear and bright and beautiful with the expansion and blessed soul that comes with God’s Love. 

So much to experience, beloveds. You just begin the journey, a journey that shall never end. Be grateful for what is given, what you have, the treasures that you have already laid up within your soul. You will find with gratitude, patience, perseverance, and faith and the application of the truths that have already been given, you will find your way. The impediments will fall away from you. As you continue to stretch and yearn for God, you will find deep peace and joy. As these impediments fall, as you become more in alignment with your Heavenly Father, you will find freedom from all that burdens you. Indeed, this will be replaced by peace, deep and abiding peace. With this peace will come great joy and great knowledge, great understanding of the universe of God. 

This is what your souls seek, my beloveds. This is why we are with you, so close. Because the trueness of your soul desires to awaken in truth, to be blessed in Love, ignites the laws that bring us close, ignites the blessings that reinforce and awaken you in truth, ignites the Love that flows by the Holy Spirit to you, beloved souls. Seek the truth in this simple, but powerful way. Though it challenges you, it does so in a way that also strengthens and awakens and is given in that gift of the Father’s blessings upon you. 
Faith grows as you overcome the hurdles, the challenges of this journey. 

Truth is awakened as you put aside those biases and impediments of the mind. Joy comes as you come to know your own soul in relationship with God’s great Soul. In this way, there will be no confusion, no ambivalence, no fear, only love, only love. Then you will be that beautiful channel, that instrument of God’s Love in the world. It is now, but it shall be stronger and greater and more effective as you grow in your soul. This I wish for you. For as you grow in this way, as you are a light in this way, the Light and Truth of God’s Love, you become my disciples. You are God’s channels of Love and this Truth will spread by your efforts, by the Light that grows within you, by the strength that comes from you and within. By all that is good and all that is of love, these things come. 

My beloveds, know that I love you. Know that the Father loves you dearly and that your efforts are well known. That God knows you and knows your struggles. God ensures that you are never alone, that you are always loved. That you shall always be loved and surrounded by the Light of His Touch and the angels that have been transformed by this Love, and by all the Light and blessings flowing forth to you. What more could you wish for, beloveds? What is more important than this? It is your destiny and your journey toward truth and fulfillment and joy.

God bless you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I love you. I love you and shall never leave.
