May the Breath of God be upon you and the peace that passes all understanding envelop you, that the Father's Love may indeed enter into your soul, adding to that Substance that is transforming you and awakening you to truth. 

I am Andrew and I come in prayer and desire to be with you. My prayer is that the floodgates of the Father's Love, coming through His Holy Spirit, wash over you and be your salvation, your blessing and your peace. For these things from God can only come from God. You beseech the Source of all Truth, of all Love and of all Light. You seek to be in alignment with this blessing and so you are, beloved souls. So you are. Intrepid travellers upon the Path Divine, beautiful, beautiful souls seeking to fulfil their potential, all the possibilities that God has put within you that may indeed be realised and expressed through you and within you.

There is so much yet to travel, beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. There is so much to know and to discover. Each of you is travelling your unique path and yet, together, you travel the Path of Truth. In this, you are strong. In this, you abide by the Truths of God. In this, you are a light, and you create a light that is beautiful to behold and powerful in its presence upon the world.

We are all God's children. We seek to be with God, to know God truly and to be God's instruments in the world. Ask for God to prepare you upon this path, that indeed your gifts and instrumentalities may be expressed and known to you consciously and expressed through you consciously. That you are indeed a bright light, a channel of love. 

How blessed you are, beloveds, how blessed you are to know the truth, to know it as you do, to have the clarity, to have the faith and the desire to continue on this path. For as you exercise your will, your desire and your faith, you come closer to God and closer to the truth. As you beseech God to bless you with His Love, you are being transformed and awakened in truth.

My beloved friends, we are all united in this purpose, this journey. Indeed, as time goes by and your faculties open and your perceptions widen, then you will know this to be true, without doubt, without speculation, but to be the truth that we are all united, a family within the Truth of God's Love. In this, we may gain solace, comfort and peace. That in this, we may be awakened to truth and exercise truth within our lives, so that it may bring greater harmony to us. Truth may bring further steps upon the road, so that we are truly realised in Love, transformed in Love and, in time, redeemed in Love.

What a wondrous journey we take, beloved souls. What a beautiful, beautiful time we inhabit in this world of yours, in the spirit world and in the Celestial Heavens. For God continues to open the door for the inflowing of His gift of Love. We are truly blessed and shall continue to be blessed. Those who are not yet within the Kingdom shall find their way and know the joy of it, the wonderment of it and the beauty of it. It is yours for the asking, beloved souls. It is yours. For God wishes for all His children to be within this Kingdom of Love, that they may know all the glories and wonderment of it, be freed from the human condition and awakened within the condition of soul that allows you to see, feel and hear, to understand and to grow in the Truth of the Father's Divine Love.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Andrew and oh, how I love you. Oh, how it brings us joy to see those of you on Earth, such a difficult place to navigate and to live within, yet you continue to seek out the highest Truth and the greatest blessings. How blessed you are, beloveds. How truly blessed. We will be with you always and as you grow in Love, we will be closer in our connections, in our love for one another, truly brothers and sisters. You will not be lost. You will not be alone. We will be together and God has provided this instrumentality of connection, of communication, so that we may commingle in the Love of God, know the joy of it, the beauty of it and all the comes of it. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Andrew and I love you. God bless you all in Love.

### Jesus speaks ###

Beloveds, you have asked for my presence and so I am here. I come to give you a blessing of light, an upliftment in love, for I cherish each one of you. I know each one of you and I shall be close. As you permit me to be close, so you will feel me. You will sense my presence and know that I love you. Beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters of the truth, I am with you and I bless you now with peace everlasting. As your souls open, so the Holy Spirit will infill you and transform you.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to you in love. I cherish you in love. Indeed, our hearts warm in love, love that shall be forevermore your destiny and your heritage. As you grow in this gift, it is your salvation and it will bring great and powerful gifts and blessings to each one and, through you, powerful gifts and blessings to those around you. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. I love you.
