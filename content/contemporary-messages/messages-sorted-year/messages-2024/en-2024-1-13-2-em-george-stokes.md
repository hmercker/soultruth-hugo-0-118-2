George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am a brother of this Divine Love in my soul, and now, with each one of you. For the Father has filled this circle with such love, such beautiful inflowings of God’s Essence that touches each one of you. You are each my brother and my sister. You, too, have come from afar. You have been brought here by your guides to pray and receive this blessing and many more blessings that will become apparent to you, each one. Each one here is blessed, each one has received this gift of the love of the Father into your souls and upon this path you shall walk, gingerly at first. It is okay.

You will learn that this love is strong and guiding you to your greatest happiness, your greatest joy, your greatest love and you will eventually become at one with your Creator, slowly and for some of you, cautiously. You will blend this love together with brothers and sisters. Your joy will grow and become immense, and it is all because you chose to be here, to follow this path, to open to your Creator, to open to this love. God bless you all. God bless you mightily. God bless you in so many ways, from now until forever. God bless you and welcome. Welcome to this brotherhood/sisterhood of God’s love upon this Earth. Welcome. My love is with you and joins with your soul and you will feel my love as I give to each one. And may the Father’s love continue to bless you. I am your brother, George and I thank you for coming and listening and most of all, for opening your souls. God bless you.
