Be prepared! Realise the responsibility that you carry when you gather souls together such as this and open them to these gifts. For this opening, this time of opening and developing is a very vulnerable time for each of these precious souls. They are willing and they trust you, they trust us. But they must come to realise the responsibility that they must take, the responsibility that you must take and the responsibility that we must take to have all come together in harmony, to have these individuals awakened in such a way that they are not confused nor vulnerable, but strengthened, wise and at peace.

We are happy with your plans as they stand. You are making good choices. Indeed, we will help you in your dissertations and your coordination, so that all will run smoothly and that there will be a sense of purpose, belonging, harmony and love. Nurturing all that which is of light, all that which will uphold and propel these precious and beautiful souls toward purposeful engagement with their angel friends.

They know how to engage with God. They have been practising this engagement for some time. Now it is time to understand how to engage with us in the Celestial Kingdom and how this may be accomplished in such a way that they may be used as instruments, not only for their own benefit but for the benefit of many others. It is an exciting time, it is a powerful time of opening and evolving, gifts awakening, souls coming to the fore of consciousness so these individuals may utilise their gifts, understand them and acknowledge them. For God has given each of you many gifts, each soul is resplendent in gifts.

You may open just a few when you come together, but those few will open more, will open more. It is a process, an awakening, a flow of God’s blessings through each individual, their instrumentality coming alive and being truly in harmony with God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. Be a part of that plan, be aware of that plan and be sensitive to each individual who comes. For everyone is unique and on their own particular journey. You must be vigilant and respectful of that journey. Be wise, be loving, be at peace and allow God to work through you, my beloved and beautiful friends.

God bless you. I am Seretta Kem and I love you, each one precious, each one earnest, each one playing their part in this magnificent, wonderful journey of souls awakening to purpose, to love, to all that they are. God bless you, God bless you all.
