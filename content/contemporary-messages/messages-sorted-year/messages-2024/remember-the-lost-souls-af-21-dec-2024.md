# Remember the Lost Souls - A Christmas Message 

December 21<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Received by Al Fike 

Thank you, beloved sister (Terry), for your prayers. You know I love you and I am close. I am Barbara and this season was a very busy time for me in my work, for this dear soul, myself and others spent many hours attending to the needs of those around us who were in great deprivation and great poverty. We utilised this time to connect with many and to say, “Here is a gift.” Though material it was, the message was that you are cared for and you are loved. Indeed, many felt the comfort and the blessings of these small gifts of food, sometimes toys for the children and other things.

This was the tradition of our day and your day. Though it was hard work, I have fond memories of these times, the times celebrating the birth of Christ on Christmas and the prayers I would have on Christmas Eve, just myself and God, knowing that we know and that God has fulfilled His promise to us, His promise to give us a gift, the gift of Love.

This time is often a material time. Many feel that if these needs are not met, they are saddened and feel neglected. In truth, it is a very spiritual time, a time to know God and to be with God, a time to appreciate and acknowledge what God has given you, the greatest gift of all, that you have accepted that gift and brought it into your heart, not just once, but over and over as many times as you desire. That gift is given, provided your prayers are sincere and your desires are intense. Together, as God's family of Love, are we not here to celebrate the truth? Are we not here to acknowledge the freedom that that truth has given us, freedom from true want, freedom from error, freedom from our own human foibles, which are being healed and transformed at this very moment? 

It is a gift beyond gifts and it is given without judgement. It is given to every soul who desires it, no matter their station in life. No matter their condition in the world, it is given, given freely. We are here together today to know this, to feel it and experience it for another time, another prayer that we offer up to our Heavenly Father. Give of your hearts, my beloved and beautiful friends. This is the time to give of your hearts. If you might give some material comfort to another who is in deep need, then I urge you to do so. Do not ignore those who are in deep deprivation, who are feeling unloved and uncared for. 

This is the true message that Jesus gave, the message of love. That love might be expressed in many different ways. Though the greatest gift of God's Love is meant for you personally, that blessing between you and God, what you do with that gift, how you express it in the world, is important and is necessary. Do not keep the great blessings, the great outpourings from God, to yourself, hiding away. Be in the world as God's channels of love. Be in the world open to God's guidance and inspiration, so that you may be truly a light for another.

In this way, you complete the circle, you complete the blessing. For what is love without expression, without giving light to another, to the world? Be that light, my beloved friends. Be a gift to another, that your love might shine, that you might give comfort and reassurance, that you might give a message to your loved ones and your friends that you love them and that you are there in love. In this way, you demonstrate the truth that Jesus brought so long ago and, indeed, you affirm for our beloved Master that his work continues and it shall continue for a very long time.

May you be blessed, my beloved friends, blessed in the Father's Love, blessed in the inspiration from the angels, blessed in the light, the pure Light of God's Touch upon us all, that we may be His instruments, His channels of love and give this as a constant emanation and outpouring from each of us to the world. Thus, the world is changed by those who accept the change and transformation of His Love. We affirm the truth by living it and being it.

We are God's instruments. You carry angels with you wherever you go. You are a light. Choose your words carefully. Choose them in love. Do not judge another, but give love. Acknowledge the beautiful soul that each one is. Indeed, if you might touch that other upon your daily path, then you have added light to the world. That touch may ignite a great change and a desire to enter upon the Divine Path, bringing yet another beautiful soul to God.

May you be blessed, my beloved friends, in these endeavours, in your work, in your ministrations and in your prayers. All that you do, may it be done in love. In this way, you honour the work of our beloved brother, Jesus and you are his disciples for truth. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Barbara and I love you all. I am close to many of you, my dear son whom I love, his dear mate, my beloved Terry and all in my family. I give my love and acknowledgements in our relationship of love and light. God bless all of you, for I have been with each one of you at some point and will continue to do as God guides me and brings me into service for you all. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
