Beloved souls, I am your teacher, Augustine. As the sun always rises in the East, warming you, touching you with the warmth of God’s creation, His love shall always be there beloved souls for you to be nurtured and warmed by its touch. The world continues to spin on its axis and love continues to flow from the great Soul of God conveyed by the Holy Spirit as you seek in prayer this holy touch upon you. What shall hold you back, my beloved and beautiful students when this compelling light, the beautiful touch of God’s love is all around you? Now that you know its presence, now that you feel its warmth, do you come in appreciation and love to God, your Creator that you may indeed acknowledge this great gift, that you may indeed be healed by it, comforted by it, touched deeply by the grace of God shining upon you always.

God gathers His children into the light. God brings all of you to Him so that you may feel the warmth together, that you may acknowledge your brothers and sisters as equally loved as you have been loved and are loved by God. Be true to what you know is truth, the power of which is the power to transform, heal and brighten all who are in the blessing, the warmth, the glow of this love. Always face this light, beloveds. Do not turn your back but seek it with all your hearts and souls. Seek it because it is what your souls truly need, what your souls may truly benefit from. This great Light that destroys the darkness, this great Light that brings the comfort, this great Light that is the highest gift from God. 

Each of you is loved and cared for, protected and uplifted. May you walk in the light always, seek this truth always and be an expression of this truth wherever you go. You will find that God shall accompany you, that you shall be His instrument for greater light in the world. You are blessed beyond measure, awakened to the truth, you walk in the grace of God, and you shall gather others around you that they too may see and know this great blessing, that they too may find its comforts and benefits, that they too may truly be lights in the world. 

Be true to your Heavenly Father as you are true to your own souls. Come to understand your soul in ways and means that are beyond your mindful recognition. In this way you will pave the way for greater soul awakening and greater soul expression. Do not lose yourself in the mindful pursuits, the pursuits of the body and the flesh but honour and express the pursuits of the soul, as God has intended for each one of you. As you will come to know in days to come, in weeks to come, in months and years to come, you will know this truly and the depth and breadth of your knowing will be beyond any mindful acknowledgement. It will go to your very heart. It shall pierce your very soul in true acknowledgement and understanding. This is the power of love that brings its glory forth and uplifts and overshadows any darkness with light. 

It is yours, beloved souls, each and every one, a blessing given, uplifting you beyond the earthly plane and touching you in the very depths of your being, igniting the great light and continues to burn and brighten, expand and grow in the touch of God. God bless you, beloveds. I am your teacher, Augustine and I love you dearly, dearly. God bless you in His Love always. My love is with you always, beloved and beautiful souls, seekers of truth, students of the soul. God bless you.
