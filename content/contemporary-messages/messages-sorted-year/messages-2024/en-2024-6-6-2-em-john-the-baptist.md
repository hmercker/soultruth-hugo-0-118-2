# Pray More

June 6<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John the Baptist, and I bring you my love along with blessings from the Father. For each time you pray, each time you open your souls and long for this gift of Divine Love, the Father sends many blessings to you, blessings to help you along your path, blessings to heal you, blessings for each one of you that you need to take another step forward, to come closer, to transform more and more of your souls, each and every time you pray. So, you must ask yourselves, how often do you spend time, quality time as it’s called on the Earth with your Heavenly Father? Because each time you do, more of your soul is transformed.

Recognize these times and recall what it is that you feel during these times (of prayer). It is unlike the times in my life upon the Earth where there was this outward sign of cleansing. These moments you spend with God, cleanse your soul, change your soul, brightens your soul each time you pray. So, I encourage you to pray more often. Spend more time with God and progress a little more quickly and ever so deeply.

God bless you. I am your brother, John the Baptist, and my love is with you. The love of thousands of Celestial Angels who are here with you now is with you. So, open your souls. Receive the gift that God has for you now and accept our love as well. For we do love you. You are cherished. You are loved and you are our charges. We so love you. God bless you. May God’s love pour upon you at this time. Open your souls, dear children.
