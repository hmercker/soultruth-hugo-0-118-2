Hawaii, USA

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, my beloved children. I am your teacher, Augustine. I wish to encourage you to be brave and to be strong in your dealings with the world. For it is easy to reside in your own safety and abode of light, to be nourished by God in your prayers, to live a life simple and blessed. This is a beautiful gift from God. Each of you have your sanctuaries, your places of light, safety, blessed in light.

But it is the world in need, my beloved and beautiful students, that you must set your gaze upon. For how is God to work if you but cower away in your safety and blessed home? Prayers, indeed, are helpful and can be powerful, but actions are more powerful. Efforts are more direct when one is out into the world, seeking to be used as God's channels. This may be done in simple and quiet ways. Yet, you must be in movement through your communities, through this world, in order to become an active agent for God.

There are times when you are blessed with gratifying conversations where you may speak of the Truth of God's Love. Yet, there are many times when you may not have to speak at all, but to walk in the world as God's agent and channels of love and light, to do so with humility and grace, to do so with a sense of love for each and every child of God. The world is a very diverse place. There are many different attitudes and perspectives. You are well aware of this, beloved souls. It is not the mind that we are dealing with particularly. It is the soul. That soul to soul contact, that connection, is what we wish to encourage. That is what God uses to bring His blessings. He utilises your soul as the conduit for His great Soul to reach out to another.

This is not the only way in which God may reach another individual, but it is an effective way, a powerful way. When you walk out into the world with faith that you are being utilised by God as His instrument, then many things may be accomplished. Surprising things, beautiful things may be accomplished by your actions, your attitudes and your presence. Be with God, beloved souls, wherever you are. You do not need to hide away to be with God. You may be with God everywhere and anywhere. It is for you to have faith and knowledge that this is the truth and to live the truth of His Love in your life in every way possible. I know that each one of you make efforts in this regard. Each one of you desires to be God's instruments, wherever you may be. I am merely reminding you this is an important aspect of your ministries. Each one of you has a ministry. Whether you acknowledge this or not in your life, it is so. For God's instruments are set about the world to do His bidding, His Will in the world.

Thus, this is the ministry that is dedicated for the upliftment and benefit of humanity. See yourself in this light and acknowledge this. Bring this to your consciousness so that when you are moving in the world you will see from that perspective, that capacity to be a channel of love wherever you go, to whoever you meet. Indeed, to be a channel of love is the highest calling. Each of you understand what this means and how you may do this in your life. As I say, I merely encourage you to continue and to intensify these efforts. To see as you move in the world, that indeed, God is moving with you and that you are moving with God.  Together you are accomplishing the dispersion of darkness and bringing light.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, in this endeavour, in your efforts, in your prayerful times and in your active times. At all times in your daily life ask to be used as His instrument, His channel of love. That prayer will be answered in many wonderful ways. God bless you, beloved students of truth. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am with you, as you well know, often, as are many angels who come to pray with you, to walk with you, to be with you. God bless you. My love is with you always. God bless you.
