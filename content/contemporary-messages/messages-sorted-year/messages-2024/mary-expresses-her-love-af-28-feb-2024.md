May the sweet Touch of the Heavenly Father be with you. I am Mary. I come because I love each one of you. I come because you are sincere in your prayers and desire to grow in the Father's Love. So, you draw the angels into your midst. You draw me close and I love you. To come together in this way, in these prayers, joyfully so, you draw many to you. Not just the angels of God, but many spirits who are needing the light, drawn to the light. You have created the light amongst you so that the warmth and glow of this Love penetrates out into the darkness and draws those who are needy, afraid and alone, desiring the warmth, the blessing of this light. 

I ask you to remember each time you pray, that you pray for the world. There are many in need of your prayers. Many desiring God's blessings but not knowing how to pray, how to open themselves to this Light and Touch from God. Each one of you here are well-versed in prayer and ability to bring God into your midst. His Love flowing into your souls. In this way you bring light, light and more light so that in this darkened world there is respite, refuge, blessings, peace and love filling this room, stretching out from this room into the fields, over the meadows, touching the birds and the animals, touching many souls. They will feel a temporary upliftment and wonder where this comes from. 

You see, the world needs you. The world needs you to continue to pray with earnestness and desire so that God may flood the world in light. You serve your Heavenly Father. You serve your Heavenly Father, you serve your Heavenly Father with your loving prayers, desires and efforts together. Do not release your desire to pray, but continue to strengthen it, to strengthen your faith, to strengthen your efforts, to be in the grace of God, to be in His Love, to express His Love. Together you are joyful, light-filled and uplifted. So, it should be and shall be. This is God's desire for each one of you, and for all His children in the world to know the joy of love, the joy of connection, acknowledging the lights within each other, appreciating the differences and the similarities. 

Oh, my beloved, beloved, beautiful children of light, know that we join in with your joy. We join in with your desires and your prayers. We pray as well. So, the light builds. The blessings come and all the glory and beauty of God's Touch upon you, beloveds, upon each one. 

May you know the peace that passes all understanding. May you know the joy that is His Love. May you know the wisdom that comes with His Love. May you know all the blessings, all the blessings that come with His Love. I am close. I am Mary and I love you. I love you. Dear beloved ones, I love you. God bless you.
