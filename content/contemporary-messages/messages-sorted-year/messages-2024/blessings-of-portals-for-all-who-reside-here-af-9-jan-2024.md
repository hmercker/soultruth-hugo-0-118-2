Received by Al Fike 

Dear precious children of God, may His Love find lodgement into your souls with great abundance of this never-ending gift to be yours for eternity; that it transforms and heals you in every way; that you become the soul that God has made, created you to be. 

All that you are will be touched by the great Essence of Godâ€™s Soul and will bring about the alignment, healing, and manifestation of your beautiful gifts and abilities of the soul. These faculties shall shine in light, awaken in truth, be expressed in love. Come into alignment with God. 

In such a place as this, where alignment and understanding of God is so distorted and distant, you have found your way. You have found your way, and the channel of light, the portal of light, is given to you. That you may be reinforced and blessed continuously by this gift of a portal to each one of you who reside in this place. 

Be sure to utilise this gift. For God is giving you a special blessing. Be sure to understand and be aware that this portal of light, this beautiful cone of light that is given, a direct passageway between God and yourself, is given to protect, encourage, uplift and to bring readily the blessings of God to you.

Have faith that God will look after you. That you will be led upon the path that He has designated for each one of you. Make your time and effort to be with God. For these things do not come just from happenstance. They come from effort, from time spent, from your desire expressed, from all that you are, opened, and with your Heavenly Father. 

The beautiful Creator of all things knows you intimately and personally. God is not a distant being. God is your Heavenly parent who comes to nurture you, to help you to grow, to help you to stand upon your two feet and walk in the world as a light, to know yourself as you truly are and meant to be. 

In all of these ways, God gives to you many blessings and opportunities to grow, to strengthen, to learn how to truly love yourself and others. Great gifts are given by God. So many do not understand the nature of God, the loving nature that is God, the expressions of God's Soul, meant for you, each of you. God does not judge or withhold. God gives in such generosity, that if you could know the depth and breadth of His Love for you and the beautiful generosity of His blessings, you would cry a river, dear daughter, cry a river of gratitude. Blessings to you, blessings, upliftment and joy. 

You are meant to be in the joy, peace and Grace of God. You must strive, my little birds. You must fly to the pinnacle of light through this avenue of light given and be in communion with your Heavenly Father in all the glory, love, peace and joy that there is awaiting you in this place of great light and Presence of God. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Confucius, and I give to you my blessings. Yes, dear daughter, through your calligraphy, I will communicate. I will communicate. We will have conversations. You will know my presence. For I will give my dedication to you, my beloved daughter, and your efforts. This is my gift to you. My love for you, beloved soul, precious, beautiful, and yearning to be a light. We will take that journey toward light, dear daughter. A powerful journey, a journey of transformation and love, it will be given. For you desire this. Deep in your soul is a powerful yearning for this. You will find the realisation and expression of these things of the soul. They will come and flutter toward you. Precious bird, your plumage will change colours, and you will be more beautiful than you ever thought you could be. 

God bless you, beloved souls. Each one of you has angels by your side, and efforts made for your transformation, education, and the joy to be placed and built within you through His Love. God bless you. I love you, each one, precious souls. Beautiful birds of God, shall we fly to the bosom of our Creator and know the warmth and affection of His Soul? God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I love you.
