# All the Races in the World Must Come Together in Harmony

May God’s great Spirit be with you. I am White Feather. All the races of the world must come together in harmony, for what truly separates is only of the superficial. What truly brings people together is the soul awareness and condition of love. In this way, there is no separation, no barriers. Yes, cultures are different, perspectives are different. But love heals, combines and unifies all things and brings harmony amongst humanity. 

Does this instrument only channel those who are of his heritage? No, there are many from many different heritages, many different cultures, many different lives of experience while on Earth that come to speak and to share their stories and their truth. God made humanity with great diversity. Thus each contributes to the whole of the human race. Each has their perspective and their truth that they might share and bring enlightenment and truth to others. It is in this diversity that greater truth is perceived and shared, for no individual has all the truth. But, when many come together, then greater truth is known. 

What a blessing that is, that each soul is created unique and each individual that walks your earthly plane has its own perspective and experience in life. This is a beautiful gift for one another. Indeed as you all learn to be together in the unity that is a family, then greater light is created, greater love is shared and greater truth can be expressed in the world. Be as one in your love for God. Yet you are individual and you might be truly yourself and accepted and loved by others in that individuality. Aspects of the soul are able to put aside personality and these individual perspectives that are often of the mind. 

In this there is a oneness, a deep bond, a connectivity between one’s soul and another and another until that great Lattice of Light expresses the deep yearning of humanity toward God. As that Lattice of Light grows and is added to by each individual, then it becomes a firm and powerful network for communication, blessings, beautiful energies and expressions that are being added to by each person. In this, the Lattice of Light expands, is strengthened. 

You are all a part of this. Indeed when you look at your relationship with your brothers and sisters in this way, then how can there be any difference that is unacceptable, any conditions that bring out biases and unloving perceptions and feelings? Rather, in that great network of humanity, that family of souls, each is given his or her place, each is honoured, each is acknowledged in love. This is how the world must be, children of God. 

This is how love must proliferate, one to another, seeing from the eyes of the soul, understanding the true nature of God’s creation and seeing God’s creation in all its forms, beauty and intricacy with love. When love touches all things, all peoples, all of creation, then there is harmony and light. Is this not your goal, my friends? To live in a world of harmony and to proliferate harmony with your thoughts, your deeds, your light and your love that all is an expression of your soul awakening to the beautiful Love of God pouring into you, transforming you and blessing you so.

My beloved friends, appreciate the diversity of God’s creation, the diversity of one another, how this makes life interesting and filled with invitations and opportunities to explore, to share, to be together in loving harmony and truth. Each expressed in their own way. Each love given in their unique form, one to another, creating a lasting bond, a beautiful network that shall proliferate in the world and bring harmony to it. You are each beautiful souls. You each contribute so much in your own way, through your own gifts. Continue to walk the Path of Love, acceptance and honouring God’s creation. As your souls grow, so the depth and breadth of that honouring, of perceiving and acknowledging the beauty of God’s creation grows with it and it shall continue to be empowered and become powerful in its expression. 

Blessings to you, beloved souls of Earth. Blessings from the Great White Spirit to your beautiful souls. It shall be an endless journey of love and unique expression of each soul in God’s universe. I am White Feather and my love is with you all. I honour each of you and see you for who you are and what God has created. I put my appreciation to God in seeing and knowing you and experiencing your presence in my life and in many. Blessings to you, my friends. Blessings, indeed.
