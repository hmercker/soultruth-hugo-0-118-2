# Teaching Your Brothers and Sisters 

October 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Chicago, IL, USA

Moses received by Elizabeth Mack

You have many friends here. I am Moses and there are many in this circle and many outside this circle who seek to know what this bright light is and it is true that each of you contribute to this light, this light that comes from your souls and was put there by Godâ€™s love.

You each have a role in this world to be a sister or a brother to other human beings who come to you and ask for help, who want to know why, why you are bright when they are not, why you are happy and when they are not. Gently, lovingly, pray for them. Pray for them deeply and then help them to understand in the way that they can understand that a love that you have for them comes directly from the Creator.

There is no other mission so important. There is no other truth that needs to be spread as much as how God loves each of His children and offers them this very special gift of Divine Love. So be clear in your communications and pray first that you may receive the help that you need to be clear. Your brothers and sisters in the Celestial Heavens are always available. Remember to call upon them when you pray. And each day before you start your day, allow them to come close so you remember what that love feels like.

My love is with each and every one of you and the hosts of Celestial Angels who are attending this prayer session extend their love to you as well. And the Father blesses you as well. So be open. Come close to God and receive the nourishment that your soul requires. I will be with you throughout this prayer and beyond because I love you and because my Father desires me to do so. God bless you, each and every one. May God bless you deeply. I am your brother, Moses and I speak only the truth.
