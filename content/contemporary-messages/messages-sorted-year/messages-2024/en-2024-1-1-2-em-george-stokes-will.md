George Stokes & Will received by Elizabeth Mack

**George:** I am here. We are here. I am George and Will is with me to speak to you. We bless this soul with our love, for he comes from a distant planet and is here to express his love to all who gather.

**Will:** I am Will. We are ready and able to assist our brothers upon the planet Earth whenever you require us to do so. We come with loving intentions. We come because God has asked us, because our love moves us. We come because you are our soul siblings. We will come to enrich your lives as needed. You may, as you have prayed, trust us, for we are God's children and true children in our souls. We have gained this Love from God. We desire to manifest this Love as service to you, our brothers and sisters upon the Earth.

Come to know us well. Be with us in this prayer, as well as with our Heavenly Father, whose Love pours upon us all at this time. My beloved brothers and sisters of the Earth, we come to help you and assist you to grow in this Love. I thank you for allowing me to speak and, yes, I was the one who sat next to you, showering my love upon you, and will do so again many times. You may call me Will.

Thank you, George. God bless you, Elizabeth, and all my brothers and sisters of the soul.

**George:** Trust is a valuable thing. Yes, it is George. It is valuable and will be, in the new world, highly valued, so go ahead. Learn to trust. Pray for faith and allow yourselves to trust, first God and then those souls who come from the Celestial Heavens, who come because God has asked them to come. Trust is essential, as essential as Love from God.

I am your brother, George. I will step back now and leave you with my love and desire for a full, loving relationship among all of you for this year upon the Earth. God bless you. I am your brother in the love of Christ.
