# The Greatest Gift you can give

November 26<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

It is I, Judas, your brother and friend. Here in the season of giving that begins with giving thanks for every blessing, for our loved ones, for our safety, for our shelter, for the bounty of the earth, and above all these things, for the great gift of Divine Love. This gift will carry you, carry you over the world, carry you through the valleys, through the shadow of death, through your troubles, into the world of light. 

As each one of you begins to be transformed in the love of God, you begin to recognize the light in your soul and as you start to rely on the perceptions of your soul, you may discover you hear a small, still voice and in the gift of clairaudience, which is an internal hearing, as my brother is hearing at the moment. You may discover clairsentience, where you begin to feel the presence of your guides, of the angels, and utilize the guidance that comes through in your feelings. And most, if not all, are aware of clairvoyance, being able to see us and spirits in general. 

Depending on the quality of your soul life, it will determine such capabilities, such gifts. And though you may activate these gifts through your soul perceptions, you can certainly take the love in your soul and love others. For, in this season of giving, many souls are more open to receiving, therefore allowing you to love them with all your heart and from the depths of your souls. 
   
And as you have been told, you cannot place the Divine Love in their souls, but you can create a longing for it. The longing my brother here had when he met his Care and realized that she had in her possession a joy and a light that he did not possess despite all of his learning, all of his books, his teachers, his yoga, his diets. His soul knew. And that was her gift and for my brother, it changed everything. One simple gift and it was given in the season of giving as well as a special dispensation which allowed him to see two celestial angels. Though I was not present, I have spoken with John and Mary, and they have informed me of this visitation. 
     
When God gives you a gift, you can thank God by using it. It may not seem a huge thing, but in fact, as this brother knows, it can certainly be life-changing. Of all the gifts you can give, each one of you knows what the greatest gift is. To be rich in the possession of the love of God is true wealth. We encourage you to share it as we share ours with you and God blesses all. 
    
So, with all my love and blessings in this season of joy, I shall step back in this prayer, in the love of God, and be with you all. 
   
I am your brother and friend, in Christ. I am Judas. God bless you.
