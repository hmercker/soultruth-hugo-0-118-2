Augustine received by Al Fike

May the blessings of the Father’s Love continue to enter your souls, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. In the universe of God, His Will reigns supreme. All that is part of the great flow of progress, and unfoldment of truth, love and light is accomplished in God’s universe. As you have indicated in your prayer dear son, humanity long ago decided to not be a part of God’s universe in this regard, but to be a part of their own creation and condition. Thus, you find yourself today in a world that is fractured, a world that continues to struggle and suffer.

Humanity has made for itself a horrific condition that is very much out of alignment with God’s Will. Each of you struggle to regain your place within the Will of God, the Universe of God. Thus, you have drawn to you angels, bright spirits, even stellar friends that continue to support you in these efforts. As you struggle, as you continue to strive towards light, truth, and harmony with God’s Will, you wish to bring others with you. You wish to draw your brothers and sisters into this truth and inspire them to join you in this journey of soul awakening, to know the wonders of God’s Love, to know all the beauty of God’s touch, healing and blessings upon his children.

So, we in the Celestial Kingdom commend you for this and we continue to support you in your efforts. Think of God’s efforts. God broadcasts blessings, love, all manner of good things freely upon this world. How many in your world are receptive? How many decide to embrace these blessings? The vast majority ignore, are ignorant, are in such a state of darkness they cannot feel or know and see God’s blessings for them. Nonetheless, God continues to broadcast His blessings upon the world. Indeed, the souls of many feel and sense this blessing, but cannot truly partake of it because their minds continue to block and to reject. It is all about free will, beloved souls.

It is all about accepting, embracing, desiring, in order to receive. You ask, should I proceed with this venture or that venture or to open the gates of truth to others. I say to you, continue, for as God continues so must you, even though God encounters much rejection, and so do we in our efforts. This does not mean that we should give up on these efforts but to persist. Persist, beloved souls. For those who persist will find success. Those who turn away from rejection and disappointment will join the human condition and not strive to be something higher and more than this.

It is all about your free will, beloved souls. It is all about your efforts to strive and to reach out to others. Your efforts at times will fall on fallow ground and at other times will fall on fertile ground, but indeed the efforts have been made. Each time you make these efforts, God is blessing you and we are with you, supporting you and upholding you.

I beseech you, my beloved and beautiful students of truth, to continue to make your efforts. Yes, when the effort is in harmony with the Will of God, then you will feel the impetus to move forward. When this effort is primarily of your will, then there is a greater chance of failure. Even so, when it is your will, you may accomplish something that surprises you, something that you did not expect or anticipate. God will use every opportunity to bring forth blessings, to open the gates and the doors to these blessings, that others may receive them gratefully and with enthusiasm.

This is your task my beloved, beautiful souls of truth, to continue to speak the truth, to share the truth, to be prayerful in the truth with others. In this way, you will find much success and some failure. This is part of your earthly condition. Yet without effort, there is no success. Without time applied and energies expended, what is there? There is only complacency and passivity. Unfortunately, this is what rules the world, beloved souls.

Many have spiritual inklings and a measured desire within them for spirituality, but how often do they act on this? How often do they apply themselves and seek out the gratification of their soul’s desire? This you must encourage in others. Show them the way to fulfil these desires. Show them what their souls truly desire. When you do this, you can rest assured that we are with you, and that God is with you. You may falter in your language, in your perspective, for you are human, but indeed some effort, any measure of effort is worthwhile. We encourage you, beloved souls. We encourage you and continue to encourage you until that day when you pass into the spirit world and find a new way of being, a new way of teaching, a new way of serving, a new way of loving.

There is still a great deal of work to do, beloved souls. Is any of your effort wasted? No, nothing is wasted in the economy of God’s guidance for you. In the economy of your efforts to learn and to grow in love, nothing is wasted. All is a blessing and can be a blessing if you are willing to look, and to consider and contemplate, and to act and consider and contemplate again. Do not be impatient, but be true to your own heart’s desire to serve in love, to bring the Truth of God’s Love to humanity. In this, you will find great fulfilment and joy, provided you are not willing to quantify your efforts in such a way that the mind is gratified. Rather, qualify your efforts in the sense that God is pleased by your beautiful desires and actions in the world.

This brings light whether there is great gratification or not, whether individuals acknowledge you or not. This light is shining forth in the world. Your light is shining forth in the world and therefore, you become God’s instrument shining forth, shining forth. I urge you not to concern yourself with who is watching, who is acknowledging, who is accepting and who is rejecting. This is a fool’s game, beloved souls. Rather, your objective and your job is to shine forth as a light. When you can travel and do so in various places in the world, then these places benefit from your presence.

Indeed, it is a beautiful blessing to gather souls together and speak the truth and pray for the Love of God. We certainly encourage you to do so. When those numbers are few, do you think we are disappointed? Do you think God is disappointed? No, my beloveds. We are merely happy that you have made a presence in the world. The few souls who are curious and possibly eager have joined you to indeed strengthen the light, to indeed bring your angel friends close and utilise that opportunity to bring blessings to others, even though they may not be aware.

It is not important that you gratify your ego’s desire for numbers and quantified results. These things are of the mind. What is important is that you act on your desire to serve God, to bring the light of truth into the world. Indeed, at times you will have many surrounding you and at times you will have very few, but this is the way of the world. This is the way that you must adjust to. Rather than feeling disappointment, anger, and frustration, feel joy because in truth you are becoming a redeemed soul and God is blessing you with His Love. In this, you carry this resounding truth into the world wherever you go. It may not affect the minds of many, but it does affect the souls of all you meet. It is a resounding bell that says you must seek out the desires of your soul. Seek out the Love of God. Seek out all that is of good and of light. As you are part of this great bell toll of truth, you are doing God’s work, and God is pleased. God loves you so.

My beloved brethren do not worry for numbers. Instead, be focused on stepping forward and how that might be accomplished. In this way, you become an instrument, an active agent for God. In this way, we may work, and God may work to help facilitate blessings in the world.

God bless you, beloved souls, my students of truth. I am your teacher Augustine, and I love you. Truly, I have great appreciation for your willingness to serve, to bring the Truth of God’s Love to the world. You will bless many, whether you are aware or not. Many will benefit from your efforts. God bless you. My love is with you.
