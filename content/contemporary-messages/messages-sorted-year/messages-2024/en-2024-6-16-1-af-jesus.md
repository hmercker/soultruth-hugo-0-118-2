# A Father’s Day Tribute and Blessing

June 16<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May the Father’s Love enter your souls. Beautiful children of God, I come. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come this day. As you honour your brethren, so I honour my brethren. For we are one in this great family of Truth and Love. I honour all of you. This day, it is appropriate that I honour one who has been a faithful servant for many, many years, and he is the one which I speak through today. For he started his journey at a tender age. If the truth be known, he started at the beginning of his incarnation and even then, that was not the beginning. For as a soul created by God, God imbued in him a purpose, a gift and ability to serve God in truth if he so wished to do so.

This does not make him unusual, for every soul has a purpose. Every soul is gifted. But what makes him unusual is that he decided, he chose to walk in the Truth of Love. Through circumstance he discovered the Truth of Love. Though he feels that he has fallen into this truth by happenstance, this is not true. He was guided, protected and shown the way. Indeed, as a child he had many trials and tribulations. But as an adult, even in the eyes of his family and those around him, he has had great success in his life and his life has been imbued with great purpose.

We speak through him today as we have done almost everyday. He accepts this responsibility and this gift, and continues to uphold it as a dedication of his love for God. In God’s love for him, he is upheld, blessed and in the Light. Yet, he is merely a mortal, a human individual who walks the Earth as you walk the Earth. Yet, the difference between himself and many others, is that he had a longing for spiritual knowledge, a desire to glean this knowledge within his soul and his consciousness. So, he did. Curious and questioning, he walked the Earth finding answers to his questions. God provided him the answers through many who upheld him, some who loved him dearly.

Through this journey, he began to understand some of the layers and complexities of the individual. Not just those things that are of the material and obvious, but those things that are more subtle and just as powerful in the development and expression of an individual. He learned the power of a soul in prayer, longing to find his way to God. In this longing, which was weak at the beginning, he persisted and found the way and means to know God and to be blessed by God. The man who stands before you now is a man who has made great efforts to walk the Truth of Love, to be God’s humble servant in Love. So, he is my beloved, beautiful brethren. So, he is.

I honour him in love and appreciation, in the light that he has become, in the servant that he is each and every day. For he lives and breathes the Love of God. He does not shirk his responsibilities. He does not shy away from the opportunities set before him. Yet, many of these things have been a challenge to him, a person who was not used to speaking in public or speaking to any of you, a shyness that was debilitating, a lack of surety that did not give him confidence. Yet, he overcame all of these things because God, in His Love and the blessings of His Love, helped him to shirk off these burdens and be free in his self expression and in his gifts.

I present to you, my beloveds, an example of the power of God’s Love to touch one individual. His journey is not unique. His person is not necessarily special or sought out by God in such a way that is unique. Rather, he is you and you are him upon the journey, the path toward God. Yet, what made this beautiful soul unique? It is his dedication, his daily prayers and daily efforts to serve. Thus, he has been richly and deeply blessed because he has opened himself up to the great river of God’s Love and Will in his life. So, my beautiful and beloved friends, he is not loved more than you. Certainly, the blessings that have been bestowed upon him are not restricted to him. But he has longed for, asked for, prayed for and opened himself up to the great gifts that God has to give to him. The gift of Love, the gift of protection, the gift of mediumship and deep intuition, the gift of compassion, so many gifts expressed through a soul that contains many more.

He just begins his journey as God’s beautiful child, an instrument of His Love and Will. As do you, my beloveds, as do you. Seek out the potentials of your soul. Seek out the blessings of God and all else will follow, my beloved and beautiful brethren. All else will follow. I speak through him because he has allowed and provided the ways and means through his efforts so that this may be done. As a humble soul, he is not comfortable with the words I speak, but I must declare him, for he is truly my brother and my love for him is great.

I declare each and every one of you, my beloveds, for we are all brethren together in the Truth of God’s Love and shall be for all eternity. I honour you as well, merely placing the example of my brother as what can be accomplished, what can flow and be expressed through one individual. Each of you has the potential to be a magnificent channel for God. His Love flowing through you, His blessings, what He has gifted you with, expressed in light, love and truth. Each has their path to trod. Each may, indeed, walk with God and be guided thus.

My beloveds, I leave you with a blessing. A blessing that you shall be upheld for all the days of your life in the Love, Truth and Light of God. That in this upholding of you, that the truth of your true selves may be expressed and that the fruits of your labours may benefit your brothers and sisters. Be with God, my beloveds. Be with God always and God shall always be with you, never to forsake you. So shall I, my beloveds. So shall I and the Angels of Heaven. All that is good and of light and truth shall uphold you, my brethren, forevermore, forevermore. I love you. I love you all. We are truly blessed, are we not, in this love? God bless you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom. I come to you with love.
