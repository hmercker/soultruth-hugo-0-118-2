September 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Lansing, MI, USA

Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

Bless you. I am your brother. I am Jesus and I see each one of you as you truly are, brothers and sisters in soul, bright, illuminous, joyful and happy that we are together in this Love. The Love that the Father has gifted upon each one of you and many, many, many more. For this is what the Father desires, that you receive the blessing of His Love to transform your soul into a living, active, Divine Love soul. A soul that knows its Creator. A soul that knows the joy that the Father bestows upon each one of His children who asks for this Love, this Love that penetrates deeply into every part of your being. Transforming you, loving you, raising you above those conditions which are not of the Creator’s making and which are not in harmony with the Laws of Love. The Father desires the highest, the greatest, the most love for each of His children, to become at-one with Him in this Love, to join together eternally.

My brothers and sisters, build your love and faith through the presence of God’s Love. Open your souls. Allow those longings that are deep within you to rise ever so gently to the waiting Soul of your Creator. Feel His response as He Touches you with His Love and brings you a peace that you have not known before. Come with us now, closer to the Father’s Love as we raise you above these conditions into the light, into the presence of many, many other souls who have been blessed with this sacred gift. As you are raised, open wider. Receive all that is intended for you. All the blessings that our Creator, our Father desires that you each shall have, designed specifically for your soul.

Come closer and closer to this fountainhead of Love and allow the Truth to come into your soul. Feel the Breath of God upon you. Allow His Love to guide you, to bring you to a place where you and He may commune. Once you have tasted this Love, felt this experience in your core, you shall come back again and again to revisit this sacredness that is always available simply for the asking. Drink up, dear brothers and sisters, and live.

I am your brother in this Christ’s Spirit. I am Jesus and my brethren are here always to help you as you walk this path. May you be open to the Father’s Love always. May you allow God’s Love to guide you. May God bless you forever.
