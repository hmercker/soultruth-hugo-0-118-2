……God loves you. I am Goldie. How sweet are those chimes? (referring to a cell phone that rang during [Orion’s message](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2024/en-2024-2-29-5-af-orion/)). How sweet is God’s Love? God continues to remind you that He loves you. God continues to beckon you to that place where you may feel and drink of this Love, this glorious Love, that heals all wounds, that brings you to a place of light, that awakens you to joy.

May you know the joy, my beloved, beloved friends, always. May that flutter of joy live in your heart forever and grow and expand so that you are joy, you are truly joy in the world. I love you, my beloved friends, who continue to feast, laugh and pray together. Know that I love you and I am there with you, especially when you are laughing. I love laughter. It is the healing, healing voice of the soul saying to God that there is joy, joy in life, joy in living, joy even in thoughts and deeds. All things can be of joy.

So, we are joyful together, my friends. I love you and I am joyed to be with you. God bless you. I love you.
