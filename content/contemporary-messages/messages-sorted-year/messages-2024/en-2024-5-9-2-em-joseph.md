I am Joseph of the Bible. I was once upon the Earth also and the struggles were of a different kind that what you experience daily. In those times, infants, infant boys were killed because of one person who was afraid. Fear distorted his understanding of his purpose upon the Earth, but God led us away to save our child, a male who was born with a mission and God kept us away for a while to protect this very important mission.

Open yourselves to God’s guidance as we did that you may be protected for your work which is also great. Many souls need the experience of this Divine Love which you each can express to others and in so doing, give them the experience of it and if possible, teach them. Teach them to pray with deep longings. The Father will answer their prayers, and you will be blessed many folds. You each have a mission, a purpose.

So, look to your Father. Ask to know what that purpose is. Ask that it be brought forward into your awareness and pray to fulfill that purpose. For it is essential that you fulfill your purpose at this time upon the Earth and going forward, all in accordance with God’s will and God’s timing. You will be blessed as you complete, fulfill your purpose.

God’s love is with you, regardless but your blessings will be many folds as you fulfill your purpose while on this Earth. I give you my love, my blessings and encourage you along your path each one of you. I am your brother, Joseph. I was the father of Jesus, upon the Earth and my purpose was to protect him and Mary and all our children. I have been blessed manyfold. God bless you all. My love is with you. God bless you.
