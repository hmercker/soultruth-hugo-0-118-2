Beloved souls, I am Keea-atta-Kem. You continue to journey together upon this beautiful Path of Love, to make your connections and your relationships, your bonds and your fellowship. This is important to do so, to be within that group of harmonious souls seeking love together, embracing one another, upholding one another. For God meant His children to be united in love, in peace and harmony. So you become a fitting example of this for others to observe. Those who are fearful, those who are judgemental, can see that no harm comes in such relationships, but only good, the power of love manifesting through one another, toward each other. 

The power of this upholding and embracing in love is what sustains each of you upon this path and helps you to grow and be a light. As one feels diminished in the light, another comes and upholds you in the light. As one is seeking truth, then the other brings truth. As you continue to forge ahead, you feel the kinship and the strength of it to help you upon the path. It is an important thing to have in your life, these beautiful relationships that uphold and sustain, that bring to you a strength, a steady progression upon the path. Indeed all must go to God and all may avail themselves of their Celestial friends, but to have fellowship on Earth is a great boon to your life.

Our hope is that this fellowship will grow, the bonds will strengthen, and love will flow readily, that all traces of negativity and judgement, all feelings of insecurity and fear may disappear within this family of love. Thus you create a nucleus of light that will be sustained in the world. As you reach out to others and they join into this nucleus, this centre of light, they add their strength, their love and it becomes brighter. In turn, the Law of Attraction draws more and more, until it becomes a great body of light that is an influence, a power within the world to help uphold, to help heal, to help teach the truth to others. Be in this light, my beloved and beautiful brother and sisters. Do not forsake one another, but continue to uphold and to love. In this you have a great blessing and a great purpose together, to bring greater light to the world, to be a channel of Godâ€™s Love in the world, to bring healing and peace to the world, to bring truth to all. 

May you continue on this journey, my beloved and beautiful friends. I am with you. I am part of your family and shall be so for all eternity. I am your big sister. Of course, you have many sisters and brothers who inhabit the Celestial Kingdom who are part of your family, who are there for you, always. You are never alone, ever. My beloveds, be joyful for what you have and how you are in the world. For you have the key to all that is good, joyful and wondrous. For it all comes from God, a blessing from our Creator to each one of us. That blessing shall never end, my beloveds, it will flow for eternity. You will grow for eternity in the Love of God. God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea-atta-Kem and I love you. My beloved friends, I love you.
