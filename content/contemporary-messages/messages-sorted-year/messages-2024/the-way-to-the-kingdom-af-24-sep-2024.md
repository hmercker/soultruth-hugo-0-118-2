# The Way to the Kingdom

September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2024

State College, Pennsylvania, U.S.A

Received by Al Fike 

I am James Reid. I was a doctor, a physician in Australia. I passed over not that many years ago, but I knew of Divine Love. I prayed for this gift and I am now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom, which I am very pleased to say. I want to assure you that the way to this Kingdom, the way to opening your heart and soul is merely through simple prayer. There is no need to adorn the truth with concepts and ideas that, in their own way, detract from this pursuit. I, in my own way, made great efforts to intellectualise the truth<sup>1</sup> while I was on Earth. Now I come to understand that the power of truth does not lie within the words spoken, but within the heart glowing with love. This is the greatest teacher. This will bring the most effective results for those of you who are ambitious and desire to spread this truth of love in the world. 

No amount of lecturing, of description, of prescription regarding this path will truly lead the individual to understanding what it is. The power of understanding comes with the experience between one’s soul and God’s Soul, that relationship forged by love, that relationship that, when understood and recognised, will last an eternity. When the individual comes to this, in some respects, is of no consequence to you. You may glow and express and light the way and be the example, but whether an individual recognises or accepts that example, how you are in the world, is up to them. They are gifted with free will. 

But for you, my beloved friends, in this beautiful Circle of Light, so beautiful, so full of light, you are doing God’s work. You are presenting the truth to the world in prayer, in your dedications, in yourselves as you grow in love. Yes, a word here and there is helpful. I am not suggesting that it is not. But what is most important is the power of love existing within your soul. That power gives weight to your words. That power gives weight to your prayers. That power gives weight to your actions. Remember this. The most important pursuit of all is to awaken your soul in God’s Love, to be alive in this love and to live it with every breath. That is the teacher teaching. That is the servant serving. That is the child of God acknowledging their relationship with the Creator. 

Be that being of light and everything else will fall into place and be a blessing in your life. Thank you for listening to me. I am James Reid and my love for you is great, my friends. Oh, how wonderful it would have been to have Circles such as these when I was in my life on Earth. Instead, I pursued many different avenues and explored many different ways of even receiving the love. But, you are pure, focused and dedicated. In your efforts, you draw to you great light. You draw to you our beloved brother, Jesus, and many Celestial Angels. 

How blessed you are, my friends, to be together in this way and to be focused in prayer and desire to receive the great gift of love. Blessings to you upon the journey and in your efforts together for these few days. I am here with you as are many hundreds of spirits and angels who reinforce your efforts. By the Law of Attraction, you have drawn this to you. You will be beautiful servants for God, channels of love and light together. God bless you and keep you in His Love. May He light the journey for you, clear and beautiful and joyful. God bless you. 

**Note 1** James published a book called "The Richard Messages". I found it interesting, but when I had finished it I thought I would need to read it several more times to really understand what he was trying to say. I never did. But he did disclose who the source of "A.C.I.M." was via Richard, his guide. Geoff Cutler.
