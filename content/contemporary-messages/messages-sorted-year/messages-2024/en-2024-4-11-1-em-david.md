David received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am David of the Bible, and I have been here before as you know, and I bring my love to you once again and to all the brothers and sisters who are on this screen and in this circle. It is my privilege to be here with you, to pray with you, to uplift you, to bring forth the message that will help you to progress along your paths.

The Father knows each individual soul, every part of your soul. For He is the Creator of that soul. He knows what you need. He knows what you desire. He knows what you struggle with and He in the most loving way is bringing you forward through the challenges that you face, moment to moment, to walk this path that will bring you such happiness, such faith, such love. For you are His children. You are blessed as His children, and you are mightily blessed because you are devoting your lives in service to Him which in turn serves your brothers and sisters who are not so mightily blessed yet.

We all come from the Celestial Heavens to support you, to guide you, to show you the way. This is not a difficult task, but it is one that requires your focus, your attention each moment, your soul opened would be most beneficial throughout your day, that your love be expressed because that is what your soul is intended to do, is express your love and your gifts. And in doing so, you attract those souls who you can best help upon this planet. So, try, dear children, try to keep your souls open as you walk through your day and allow your love to flow out into your environment, into the space that you inhabit as human beings and when you come upon another person, another soul, respond with your love. Respond in love. Respond because your Father, your Creator has asked you to touch the souls of others that He has created.

I am very thankful to be able to come with talk to you today. It has been many, many years since I have spoken through this medium and I am enjoying our rapport once again. As I look out among all of you, I look forward to being with you also. I am David, of the Bible and mine is a sweet and gentle energy so you may not know when I am around. But I will whisper in your ear, so you know. My love is with you. My love is with all of you. May my Father’s love come down upon your souls with such might, with such tenderness, that your souls respond and open wide. God bless you, dear children. May the Father’s love carry you forward. God bless you. My love is with you also.
