Orion received by Elizabeth Mack

God bless you, children of the Earth. I am your brother from the Celestial Heavens far away. I am Orion, material celestial heavens we are talking about. I come to join you tonight in prayer, to help uplift you along with your brothers and sisters from the Earth’s Celestial Spheres. As you know we come here to help you. We are here. We are with some of you some of the time and others of you some of the time. We are here to be of service to you and to your brothers and sisters upon this planet. And we come because God’s bidding brought us here and your brother, Jesus has requested that we come and help for he knows we have done so before in helping our brothers and sisters to transform themselves and their world into a peaceful, loving, God-focused world and this we are doing here with your help, your prayers, your prayers that are answered because you dive deeply into your souls and allow your longings to go to the Father, those longings for healings, for love, for your brothers and sisters upon this Earth. Your prayers are essential in transformation of yourselves and of this world.

It was an apt reading of the message about prayer for it is the essential tool in order to become at one with the Father, to become so close that His will is shared with you, and you know what to do and when to do it. Your souls are opening as your Spring comes and flowers open. Your souls, too, are opening and they are beautiful, filled with gifts from God, filled with love from God. It is time for you to burst forth and share these gifts, share this love with your brothers and sisters and we will be here to support you in every step that you take.

It has been my pleasure to work with you and will continue to work with you, I and others from my planet and from other planets as well. We are all here because of the love of our Heavenly Father, His love for us, His love for you, His love for this planet. I am your brother. I am Orion and I thank you for allowing us to help you, to pray with you, to help transform this beautiful planet into an even more beautiful and loving and holy, I might add, environment. God bless you. God bless you all. You are such beautiful souls. God bless you.
