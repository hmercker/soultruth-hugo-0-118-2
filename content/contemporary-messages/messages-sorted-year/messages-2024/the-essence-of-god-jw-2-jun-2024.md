# The Essence of God (Divine Love) in one’s soul is the foundation of God’s kingdom on the earth

For those of you here who have studied what are called the Padgett messages received by [James Padgett](https://new-birth.net/padgetts-messages/) and (Dr Daniel G.) [Samuels](https://new-birth.net/samuels-messages/) and you have weighed that information over and against what was written in the Gospels in error, you may have had the reaction of realizing that the real truth of the life of Jesus was much more rational than the imaginings of the transcribers and the translators and the interpolators. 

And yet, although your minds, your rational minds, could perceive and can perceive the truths given not only to Padgett and Samuels but to our contemporary mediums, your rational mind cannot fathom receiving the love of God. Only the soul can perceive this. If this were not true, the orthodox churches would be preaching the love of God received in prayer, the transformation of the soul and all the simplicity of Divine Love truths. For they tend to approach things from either a very mystical set of circumstances or a very rational, intellectual way. 

As one receives these great truths in Divine Love and recognizes them as such, one must begin to truly actualize the desires of the heart and the longings of the soul to connect with our loving Creator. No mere intellectual understanding can bring this about. If one is to speak the words of truth, they must carry the essence of truth which is the love of God whether you preach it or sing it or dance it or simply share in giving, it is this essence which is the foundation, the real rock on which the community of Divine Love rests. It is not any one person. It is not any one unique path but rather the simplicity of allowing your soul to call out, *“Dear God, my loving Creator, please open my soul to the great inflowing of Your love through Your Holy Spirit, that I may be at one with You as promised by Master Jesus in the Gospels."* That truth is for us to internalize in the actualization of our wills being at one with the great will of God and in His love given freely.

I must say my dear brother here and I don’t wish to embarrass him, was hoping for a day off, that we would come through someone else, but today he was in rapport and thus chosen. There are many here so I shall step back, and I thank you, each one, for allowing me this time. May God bless you with the great inflowing of His love. I am your brother in Christ. I am Luke.
