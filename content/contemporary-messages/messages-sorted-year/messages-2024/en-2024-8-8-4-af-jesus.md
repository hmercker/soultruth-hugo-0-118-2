# Welcomes All to the Love Boat Cruise

August 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Love Boat Tour, Alaska, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike 

May the blessings of God be with you. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come to help uplift you. To clear the air, so to speak, so that we may come in greater purity and light. That the Father may bless you more powerfully within. That you may feel the peace and the upliftment of His Touch.

We are brethren. Each one of us brethren upon the journey of love, at-onement to God, at-onement with light and truth. Breathe in His blessing. Seek His Touch, and all conditions that are not of love shall clear and be replaced with light. That lightness of being that is living within the grace of God, free of all fears and anxieties, free of all doubts, filled with faith, hope and trust in your Heavenly Father. That the vulnerability will be washed away with the surety of faith. That speculation will be replaced with knowledge and truth. That that which is of the mind and the human condition may be replaced with soul knowledge and awareness. That the love that you feel will be enhanced by the Love of God, expanded. Expanded for eternity.

We are here together. Affirming this truth together, knowing that each one has their feet upon the Path Divine, seeking the assurance from God that they are truly loved. We are all Godâ€™s children, my beloveds. We share in this beautiful blessing and come to be His children in the light. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Jesus and I love you. I love you so. Each one precious to me. Each one loved by God. Each one in the light. We are together, a oneness in the truth. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you, dear ones.
