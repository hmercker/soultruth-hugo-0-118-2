# The Freedom of Change 

March 25<sup>th</sup>, 2024

I am here, your brother in Christ, Luke. Everything in God’s universe is in flux, for the universe is kinetic, and the law is change, not stasis. When organizations choose a fundamentalist approach, most especially in religion, they attempt to impose a dogma that would force any individual into a condition that is less than free. 

Religion, in many forms, has fallen victim to this wish to impose one way, one truth. You, who have come to this communion of prayer, regardless of where you began your journey have broken free and in that freedom, you have discovered the great gift of Divine Love and how when you are in communion and lifted above those boxes of belief, of concern, of fear, of judgement, intolerance, and so forth, you find yourself in the flow of grace. That is one of the gifts of God’s love. It is a freedom that allows change, and most particularly, positive change, for love is the foundation. When one is in the love of God, in the flow of change, one can be healed. 
   
The physical body responds to the vibrations, the higher vibrations I will say, that come into the soul aligned with God in love. Most importantly, a soul in ascendancy is able to, as dear sister Ann (Rollins) said, expiate those things that have kept it bound, have kept it in stasis because the Divine Love relaxes its rigidity, opens the heart, and transforms the soul. This is the condition of one in prayer, in at-onement with our loving Creator. 
 
So, feel His love. For one need not analyze the whys and wherefores, the details, but simply rest in this great gift of love. It is yours for the asking. It is given freely. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. 
  
May God bless each one of you. I am your brother in Christ. I am Luke, the physician.
