Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Seretta Kem. We have been doing our utmost to assist you both physically and spiritually to help you to overcome any impediments to your spiritual progression and the awakening and unfolding of your gifts. We work diligently in these Circles of Light to help in any way that we can to help uphold you, uplift you and to develop you.

There are many gifts within each one of you you are not aware of that will emerge, as our dear, beautiful Augustine has suggested in the times to come. Yet, these things are clothed in human condition, biases and mental conditions, even physical conditions that are not conducive to their manifestation. We help to clear away these conditions. Help you to be in good condition, as you would say, to be in the light and to be in harmony.

We continue to work in the background, helping you in many ways. I wish for you to know that indeed, as you pray in these Circles of Light that many things are happening at once as we take advantage of the condition of light here, the Portal of Light that is given and all manner of blessings from God. These are the raw materials that we use and shape, and craft them in ways that enhance and make more powerful these blessings for your benefit.

We thank you for your time and efforts together so that we may work and help you, and in so doing, help humanity. May you be blessed, beloved souls, blessed and loved. Continue upon your journey to God. In this, many blessings come. Many blessings.

God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you, beautiful, intrepid souls for God. May you be blessed greatly. God bless you.
