# The One who created you will not abandon you

I am here, Luke, your brother in Christ. My brothers and sisters, there has been much said about the current events on earth and what is to come. Of course, the law, the eternal law is change and within that law, all things progress at whatever pace each soul will allow. For you all know that God wishes to bless you, that your journey be light, free of concern, without fear, lifted in faith, and therefore, for you to progress, to be changed, is a matter of asking with your whole heart, from the depths of your souls, to be still, and to let go of all those things that you are carrying, that are unworthy and unnecessary as you walk into the future. 
    
Allow, allow, allow, this grace to come into your souls, that you may be healed, that you may be changed. Leave your troubles at the doorstep of prayer. Give them to God, for God will take care of all those things on your behalf. The one who has created you will not abandon you. As you have been told, fear and faith, doubt, and trust, hate and love, cannot exist at the same time. And though, you ask yourself, *“Yes but there are times when I’m in grace and full of love and others when I am out of harmony”,*  when you activate your will to be in God’s will, when you are free to be at one with your Creator, no things will stand in your way, no concerns can carry any weight against the love of God and His grace flowing into your souls. 
   
My brothers and sisters, relax, be at peace, open your hearts, and allow, allow this great change in you. Be of good cheer, rest in the peace and joy and love of the Heavenly Father. For, as the song goes, we are all His children and one in His love. I shall step back and join you in this beautiful circle and I thank you. I am your brother and friend in Christ. 
   
I am Luke *“The Physician”.* May all be healed in God’s grace.
