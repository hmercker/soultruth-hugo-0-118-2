I am James Tudor. It is imperative that you listen to the murmurings of your own soul. For this is where the answers lie. This is where you must go. In listening, you must be true to what comes forth. 

The undoing of many men is to interpret and to obfuscate the truth that is given. I was one such man. I read the verses. I knew the lines and I shouted to the rooftops this very truth. But did I listen to my own soul? Not often. 

When I did, I found these whisperings somewhat weak and feeble. So I ignored them, much to my own disappointment. For when I came into the world of spirit, I came to realize the great strength that I carried did not come with my oratory and mindful faculties and gifts, but the faculties and gifts of my own soul. I cheated myself out of something that was indeed a great gift from God because my mind would not accept that indeed, the soul is stronger, more insightful, more capable of speaking the truth. 

I do not wish for you, my kin and my friends to do the same. It was too late for me. All I had at my fingertips was regret. For you, each of you, you have something far different and more compelling. When you can marry the soul and the gifts of the mind in such a way that it will work to express the Will of God through you, you will have thousands at your feet. You will speak to kings, presidents, rulers and governments. For what you have and will say will be so compelling that none will turn away. What you speak in this way will awaken and resonate with the souls of humanity, men, women and children. The children have an ear for truth, where often adults do not. 

Find your way, my friends. Do not falter. The fate of the world rests on those like you who are willing to step forward and be heard and to be God’s instruments in many, many different ways. Most of which will be subtle and unspoken but will flow in the Light and Breath of God. Be true to yourselves and the gifts therein. You will find great joy and happiness in following this path of dedication, service and love for God. 

I am James, and I say to you, stand upright, speak the truth and be heard. Be damned with those who cannot hear you. I am sorry to be profane. It is a good word, don’t you think? Those who will not listen shall never. You must let the dead bury the dead and walk the path of the angels. For those who seek light shall seek you out. Those who prefer the darkness shall scorn and ridicule, but their words will fall flat and not harm you, my friends. 

May you be blessed. May you be blessed. My love is with you all. God bless you. God bless you all.
