# Founder of the Sikh Religion Brings Inspiration and Guidance from the Celestial Heavens

Received by Al Fike 

I am with you. I am Guru Nanak. My dear friend here believes that I am not a Celestial spirit. Unfortunately he is mistaken. I am indeed a member of the Celestial Kingdom and I continue to progress in soul love. Indeed every progressive spirit who seeks for the highest gift, the blessing and continued spiritual growth, must come to this choice, to walk along the path of those who are refined within their human condition and those who wish to progress further through soul transformation. So I have chosen the way of love and the way of my own soul's expansion and progression in love. 

I thank you for honouring me on this day, as do many, although I do not seek out this honouring. I merely wish that all will acknowledge the great gift of God’s Love as the greatest blessing in all the universe. In my day, I also honoured the path of Jesus and the path of many others, for it takes spiritual men and women to walk the road of light, to teach the wisdom of the spirit and the soul in order to uplift humanity. 

I urge each one of you to become teachers, to become healers, to become lights for God. For without you, the world remains lost. Indeed, those who follow religions that are strict and limited in their thinking need those who are reformers, those who challenge the status quo, as I did in my day. Yes, possibly new religions will be forming, but most importantly, individual souls will be liberated from the strictures of limited thinking and perspective. The universe is a very big place, filled with many truths. Indeed, it is common for individuals to seek the comfort of something that is limiting and yet comforting in its limitations. I say to you, this is of the mind, seeking solace in repetitive and somewhat at times archaic ideas. Yet, with the unlimited nature of the universe, is it not understandable and even reasonable to think that every soul may progress without limit? 

You have found the way to do this, my friends. I have found the way and many have found the way. In fact millions have found the way and they inhabit the Celestial Kingdom. They are my brothers and sisters. You, on the Earth plane, have a little more of a challenge to bring this truth to others. They do not like the limited ideas of many Christian churches, their dogma, their behaviour and their judgement. You bring a solution to this with open arms of love, with acceptance of all and with the freedom for each individual to pursue their own course toward God. Indeed, you possess within each of you the Love of God shining there, a bright Essence of Light, shining within your very core. That jewel beyond price continues to become ever more beautiful, resplendent in light. 

As you walk down the street, as you meet others, do not hide that light, but engage others in loving repartee, in being a channel of light and at times even speaking of this truth that you know so well. You do not know what effects you might have on others. Do you think any of us who were spiritual leaders started with large crowds eager to hear our words? No, we started very small. We followed our guidance. We heard the Voice of God in our ear and we walked the road less travelled. We were teachers and healers. We were beings of light and love. 

This I ask of you, my friends. Be that beam of light, that beautiful, resplendent soul filled with wisdom, knowledge and love. The world needs you. The world needs every one of you and more. Do not put aside that sense that God puts within you to venture forth and be His instruments and channels of love. You will find that many blessings will flow. Much will be given. Indeed, you will be guided ever more succinctly and powerfully as you continue to heed the word of God whispered in your ear, the hearing of your soul. 

As you step forward, you begin the journey. As you continue to step forward, the journey quickens and the work quickens. But, what is needed is that crucial step, that willingness to follow the Will of God, that desire to be a channel of love for others and a harbinger of truth for many. May you find your way, that in half a millennia, maybe your name will be honoured and many will have benefited from your teachings. It is possible. I was not something special. I was a humble man. Yet I knew that I had a destiny and God pointed me in the direction of it. 

So are you, beloved souls. Beautiful, humble and yet you have something so very special, beautiful and powerful. You carry the light of truth. Each of you, a lantern in the world. Light the way, my friends. Truly be with God and God will be with you. May the blessings of His great Soul continue to infill your soul and brighten your lantern until you cannot resist anymore. God’s compelling you to step forward, to teach, to heal, to embrace in love and give comfort to many. You are all capable and you are all beautiful. 

God bless you. I am Guru Nanak and my love for you continues to grow. As God’s Love for me grows, so our love for one another grows in the Truth of Divine Love. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
