# Lesson on Understanding Truth

January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Barbados

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

(I am one with my) Father. I am John the Beloved and I seek to inform you that the Father’s love pours upon you and each step that you take is paved in truth. Each step contains the truth for you to absorb, to take in and relinquish those things that are not of truth that lie within you. And this, with this comes clarity in your mission, in your soul, in your desires. Take each step carefully, considering all aspects of the truth that you are receiving. Open to it. Ask God to guide you and fill in the missing pieces in your understanding as you walk this path. For God will teach you, if you ask.

God bless you. This is my lesson for today and may the dove’s peace come into your hearts and into your souls this very day. May God love you and bless you and hold you close in His arms. I am your brother, John and I love you deeply, each and every one. May God bless you. We will be watching over you today, very closely.
