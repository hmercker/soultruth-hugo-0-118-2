May the great inflowing of God’s Love be your blessing this day, beautiful students of truth. I am your teacher, Augustine. God’s consciousness is such that He is aware of everything in His creation, His universe. Unlike those He has created, those like yourselves who must focus on one thing or another in order to be aware of it, His awareness is complete. His awareness brings in all knowing, all information, all actions, all thoughts, all events of His universe. As such, would you not agree that God has a plan for this world of yours? That because this world is suffering and out of harmony, and because God is well aware of how and why this is so, then God has devised a plan to help bring this world back into harmony and consequently all the spheres of spirit that are out of harmony. 

God has called and continues to call all those beautiful souls of light that seek to serve. God is continuing to influence, bless, uphold and teach His children how to be in harmony with His Laws of Creation. So, I urge you, beloved souls who are here and many more, to seek out the Will of God. Seek out God’s whisperings, influence and blessings so that you may be compelled to walk with God in harmony, that you may be informed as to what God’s Will is for you, that you may be inspired to be in harmony with God’s great plan for the salvation of humanity. There are many ways that you might serve God and those ways are only limited by your lack of perception, your lack of will, your lack of desire and alignment with God. 

My beloved, beautiful students of truth, you cannot go about your business in your day both in harmony with God’s Will and knowledgeable about His laws and ignore the great call that God has for His children to seek to be in alignment with His great plan. Do not just listen with one ear. Do not be in alignment only in as much as you may be blessed. Be in full alignment with God so that not only can you be blessed, but you may also act in harmony and in accordance to His plan. For without your compliance, without your embracing His plan, how can it be enacted? It requires mortals to act as God’s instruments. It requires you to find your gifts in prayer, an awakening of your soul as you seek the great gift of God’s Love. It follows that you will, indeed, make an offering of those gifts to God that He may use them and utilise them for the benefit of your brothers and sisters.

As you act as a channel of God’s Love into the world, then you are complying with God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. For what will bring solutions and harmony? It must be love. It is love. It is the power of the highest love, the greatest blessing of love that God can give. Seek out this blessing, beloved souls, and all else will come with it. You will find your way. I know that each one of you longs to be purposeful and longs to know your purpose, your path to follow, your way to express your gratitude and love for God, which is to be that loving instrument, to glean the power of truth and love as God continues to bless you. 

You will be blessed, beloved souls. You are at this moment. Truth is flowing into you, into your souls. Indeed, that truth will rise up into your consciousness. That feeling, that knowing of love will permeate your being and light your soul so that you are prepared, you are called and, in the calling, your answer will be, “Yes, I will serve you, dear God. I will serve humanity in love and I will walk the road of truth so that others might know of this love and the power of truth.” It comes to each one of you gradually as your eyes and ears, as your knowings and gifts open in response to God’s Touch upon your soul. It shall come in fits and starts, in dribs and drabs. But with each day, there is a gift of awakening, of knowing, of truly understanding the power of God’s Love within your soul as it grows and accumulates and brings the awakening forth.

God bless you, my beloved and beautiful students. Your teacher Augustine is with you often, as are many angels. May you truly be blessed. May you truly be awakened. May you truly know the Will of God which will bring to you the understanding of His plan for the salvation of humanity. Each of you can be His instruments, utilising your unique gifts. God will bless you so that you may know, God will strengthen you so that you may act and God will bring with His Love the blessings of wisdom so that you may be His humble instrument, powerful and walking in the grace of God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
