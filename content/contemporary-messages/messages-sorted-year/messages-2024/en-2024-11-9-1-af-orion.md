# Lessons on the Multidimensionality of the Universe

November 9<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Orion received by Al Fike

May the great universal gift, the blessing of the Essence of the Creator of all the universe, His Love, pour into your souls, my friends. I am Orion. I wish to speak about the multi-dimensionality of consciousness. Where is that source of consciousness, truly? We focus on encouraging you to develop your soul, that very core essence of who you are. For within that soul, when awakened by the Universal Love, the Divine Love, will bring forth a multiplicity of dimensional awarenesses, what you would call gifts of the soul.

Thus, we must focus upon this place, this source. For when it is active, when you are aware in these ways, then truth may certainly be yours. You may come to understand the complexity and beauty of the universe. Without this Essence, this fuel for the soul, you remain trapped within the material consciousness and its limitations. We encourage you upon a different path of development, a path less taken by those of you on Earth, because many are convinced that the path to true reality is in the material, five-senses, three-dimensional condition and level of reality.

This, as you are probably coming to realise, is folly. It is not true. For the reality that most engage within, though it is secured in the material way and the material form, is mostly the result of the constructs of the mind and the perceptions of the mind. Thus, it entraps you in what is the human condition, and it is difficult to be released from that condition. It is difficult to go beyond it, for it is a very solidifying state that tricks the mind into believing that this is reality.

In truth, it is a construct, an interpretation of reality that the mind has engaged within. You are all subject to this interpretation. Indeed, your version of reality, your perception of reality, is different from anyone else’s, for it is your experience in life. I do not mean to suggest that what you are experiencing and how you are being in the world is a falsity. From a certain perspective, it is inaccurate and lacking in detail, but it is your truth and your experience.

Our desire and the desire of your angel friends, all those who are working toward uplifting humanity and bringing humanity to a different place and perspective, is to diligently work with each one of you to help you add to, to augment, to transform your perception of reality. This, as I have said, is the result of a soul awakening in Love, that great power, that beautiful elixir that is present throughout the universe that is indeed proof of the existence of God. For this energy, blessing, gift, is the manifestation of the Creator and it is meant to help those who possess a soul to be enlivened and awakened by it.

There are many other emanations of God that help to unify the universe. But this one emanation, this one blessing, is meant for all beings in the universe who possess a soul and can be awakened and transformed by it. Allowing them to delve into an experience and journey through the many dimensions and many layers of God’s Creation to help them to truly understand the nature of the universe. This is a gift. This is what will spur humanity, and I am referring to all of humanity in the universe, toward further progression and development.

So, we from the stellar universe, your friends, are engaged in the support and upliftment of humanity, for we have progressed along the lines of soul development that few in the universe have. There are many who are continuing to progress in this way, but often their focus is more upon mindful and natural love means, rather than Divine Love and its ultimate expression and benefits. I do not mean to suggest that the universe is populated by many natural love-focused beings, but there is a division in terms of perspective. You will find in the future that they too will bring their influence, their knowledge and their support to Earth, as well as us, who are of a different ilk and perspective.

The universe is teeming with diversity, with many different perspectives and many different dimensions. You will come to understand, as a species, the great potentials with which humanity is endowed and how those potentials may be developed and awakened. Your desire to awaken fully so that it is transformed is, in the universe, the highest of aspirations, but these aspirations are not adhered to by all species. Many do and many do not. The Creator allows for free will choice in every situation and circumstance for those beings who possess a soul, but in order to progress, every being must find harmony with basic laws in the universe. One of those laws is to not harm but to do good.

The frightening, unusual and bizarre stories and experiences that humanity has had with other-worldly beings are not true in terms of true interstellar connection and contact. This instrument has been watching and absorbing information from a good source (Steven Greer) who says that there are forces on your world who are creating these experiences to debunk the fact that there are other-worldly beings who are in contact with Earth even at this moment. The layers of deceit and darkness of your world continue to ensure that humanity is stuck within the conditions and the delusions of its own making. These things are ensured to enrich a few and to, in a way, enslave many in delusional ways of being, acting and thinking.

This will change. It will change soon enough. There is a great plan that ensures that the world will come awake, will realise what is true and what is not, will realise what is of light and what is of darkness. This is not to say that everyone will be forced into this realisation and understanding, but they will be given definitive proof of what is in harmony with God’s creation and what is not. Though that proof may seem obvious to some of you, to many it is not. It is important that the demonstration of light, of what is good, of what is of love and what is in harmony with love, must be presented to humanity.

We are assisting in this development that will bring all of you and many others into that place of being a true channel, an instrument, an individual who is able to demonstrate these truths to others. You are part of this plan. I know you are frustrated and feel that you must move forward more quickly and with greater purpose than what is happening in your life at this moment, but this plan requires phases and stages of development that you are continuing to be engaged with. It takes time.

Indeed, along this journey, as you reach another phase of development, these things must be tried and tested. You will find yourself in interesting situations where you are tested and, at times, it could be a great trial to you. As you emerge from these conditions, you become stronger in wisdom and capacity to love, to be in light and to accept change. Many things are still ahead of you in this regard. Indeed, the process accelerates because the time window is closing. You must focus, my beloved friends, on what is important, on how you may grow and develop. You must decide to put away the distractions, to put away the old patterns of thinking, reacting and engaging within the new ways that will be part of the new world, so that you are fully prepared and are able to lead others toward this new world.

I might even use the phrase “saving souls”, for in many ways, you are saving souls from a condition and an outcome which is not particularly desirable. For those who cannot adjust to the new world, the world of light, will indeed continue in a world of darkness, not the material world, but the spirit world. They will have to take that arduous journey of choice, development and awakening that is part of that condition and that reality.

You have chosen otherwise, my beautiful and beloved friends, and I applaud you for your choices. We will indeed walk together into a new world. A new world that will be part of the greater worlds of God’s universe. A new world that will understand the possibilities of true spiritual development and awakening. A world that will be of ease, harmony and joy, rather than one that is filled with toil, pain and ignorance.

This world is coming, and you have chosen to be a part of it. You chose long ago, and you are walking within that framework of choice that you have made within your soul to be those instruments, those channels of light, truth and love. We are honoured to be a part of your efforts, God’s efforts, the efforts of the bright spirits, the Celestial angels and even the archangels that continue to toil to rehabilitate your Earth into something that is far more functional and harmonious than what it is at this time.

I have shared with you some important lessons and truths. Consider my message. Indeed, we will arrange a time in the near future where you might ask questions of me pertaining to these things and other things that are important to your spiritual development and awakening. I know you are all curious. You all have issues and questions that you are dealing with in your life. Our desire is to help uplift, to possibly clear away any misconceptions and doubts and to inspire you forward in your soul’s awakenings.

I will leave you now, my beautiful friends, and wish you great blessings of love, light, upliftment, truth and joy in your life, in how you experience life, how you see life, how you experience the universe and how you experience your Creator. These are the important things. The rest is superfluous and unimportant. May you be blessed, beloved souls. I am your friend, Orion, and I truly love you, my beautiful, beautiful friends. Blessings to you.
