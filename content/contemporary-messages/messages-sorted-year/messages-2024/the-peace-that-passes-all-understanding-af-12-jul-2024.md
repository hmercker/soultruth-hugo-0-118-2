Received by Al Fike 

May God’s Love be with you, beloved souls, I am Mylora. I come to bring healing to each one of you and bring healing into this world of yours that is in need of great healing and great peace. I engage each of you and enlist you to help me to bring healing to your part of the world. Think of the Light and the healing presence of God enveloping you and flowing through you. As you receive the great gift of His Love, so you act as a generator of light in the world. 

My beloved friends, having peace in your life is important, for it neutralises the conditions. It helps to bring harmony to your life as your mind is not so engaged in things that are out of harmony with God. With peace, you are with God. With the peace that passes all understanding, you can feel the presence of God. I engage you, I enlist you and I beseech you to be within the flow of His peace, His Love and His Will. All will come to you and bring harmony into you, through you and around you. We are all His children. God has manifested these many blessings for our benefit. God’s intention is that we all be uplifted in Light, that we are all enveloped in light, that we all know the peace that passes all understanding. God’s desire is to give to you these things and much more.

My beloved friends, there is such a wealth of blessings, gifts given. The flow of Love from God, this brings us all up into light and negates all things that are not of light. In this, peace reigns supreme. Love is the touchstone and joy comes as our soul awakens to God’s Love. As you do so, these blessings flow out to your families and loved ones. These blessings are given to those who are connected to each one of you. You help to be the generators of light and blessings for your brothers and sisters. You help to bring peace to them all. 

My beloved friends, we stand here in the Light. Breathe deeply the blessing. Know intimately the Touch of God upon you. Feel the harmony, peace and love that comes with this Touch. We are all His children, truly. We are all here to receive and to share, to be channels and to be deeply blessed by God. Shall we enter into the Light, ever higher, ever higher? Into the blessings of God’s Light and Love, His Touch upon us. Be in this gift of Light and know the peace that passes all understanding. 

I am Mylora and I love you, beloved souls. I bring my gift of healing and peace to you, each one. We are connected together deeply and that bond will never break. That bond amongst you will never break. That bond with God will only strengthen. It will strengthen all the bonds, all the connections, this great Lattice of Light. It is given in Love and shall be strengthened in Love. God bless you, beloved souls. Mylora loves you. God bless you.
