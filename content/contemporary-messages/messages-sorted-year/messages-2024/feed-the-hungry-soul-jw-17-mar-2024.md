# Feed the Hungry Soul with Love 

March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, I’m Francis, once from Assisi. I thank my brother, my elder brother, John, for his beautiful message and for this privilege of speaking to you all. 

When I gave up the world for the simplicity of service, taking the vows of poverty, my brothers and I and later, our dear sisters, we fed the hungry, we sheltered those who had no home, we sang praises to God, and we followed the best we could with our limited understanding, the teachings of the Master. Though at times this life was quite harsh, the gratitude in our hearts to serve others brought us immense joy. For when one gives, truly gives, what one receives is even greater. 

So feed the hungry with food for their souls. Clothe them in the embrace of God’s love. Shelter them in the truths that you have been given that they may find their true home and their true way home. For this giving of the great riches of Divine truth and Divine love are yours and God will bestow upon all those that you touch every good and perfect gift in His love. Be joyful in your hearts in the knowing that you have been given the greatest gift in all of God’s universe and one you can share freely. Rejoice!
 
I am your brother and friend, once of Assisi, now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom where your journey shall lead you. Let us all be at one in the great love of God in this prayer. Go in peace. I am Francis.  God bless you.
