# Spiritual Inheritance and DNA 

January 29<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your brother in the Love of God, Yogananda. There are many here tonight and several who wish to speak. So we have decided that I should deliver this message to you all. 
   
Although each soul is born with a certain amount of purity, though lacking the essence of the Creator, every soul also brings with it an inheritance. There is a very familiar group of quotations that go something along the lines of, *‘The sins or the inequities of the father are visited upon the children to the third and fourth generations.’* This was put forth in what is called the Old Testament, in Exodus, in Deuteronomy in Numbers, even Ezekiel mentions this, what could be considered even a kind of parable, and in the modern world, one often relates this to DNA and what one inherits from their ancestors. You can even get a test to see if you have a proclivity towards some kind of physical malady or perhaps something that is quite good. 

For even though one might be susceptible to disease, one is also susceptible to being an artist, having a very fine mathematical brain, being built for sports, and so forth. So, you see, there are two sides to this DNA *‘coin’.* 

And there is another DNA, and really what was being referred to (in the Bible) is spiritual DNA and how it affects one’s actions in the world but also their beliefs. This can also have two sides. It can be very limiting, or it can be very expansive, and I will give you an example. 

One may grow up in a very religious household of a certain faith and that faith brings with it many good things but also perhaps many limited beliefs and errors and untruths and you can see this in the world you live in. With one congregation being at odds with another, one religion at odds with another and so forth. 

And then there is the spiritual path, where one who wishes to break free from what they begin to see as a limited perspective, perhaps even the prison of their own beliefs and they send out a desire, maybe in the form of an actual prayer, buy maybe just in the form of their heart’s desire to break free and in God’s universe, things conspire to help that soul break free from the chains of false belief and erroneous dogma. 

Those here in this circle and our many visitors have experienced this moving from a very limited mindset and belief system to the expansiveness and eternity, or rather I shall say eternal progression in the Love of God. And though you may have come into this world with certain, as you say, encrustations or limitations from your ancestors, your receiving this love, which has no limitations, changes your spiritual DNA, which in turn will ultimately change the DNA, or shall I say DNAs of those who come after you. 
     
With every prayer, with every blessing that God brings into your souls, change occurs, expanse occurs, and regardless of your physical limitations, your soul begins to have a sense of a limitless future, in the embrace of God’s Love. 

So, whatever your history, whatever place you have come from, you now can become free, and that may be visited upon your children and for generations to come. This of course is our hope for the world. This of course is the great lineage, the spiritual inheritance from Master Jesus and all those who have followed this path, the path of God’s love. 

It exists in every part of the earth and beyond, in every religion, there is a spark of divine truth, however hidden, and you have been asked repeatedly to take this truth to the world in a simple way, with a simple prayer, with a simple statement perhaps. This blessing, this eternal gift is the greatest thing in God’s universe and when you wish it for every being, you send that out as a song of love, with a divine melody, and a celestial rhythm that delights every soul it encounters. 
   
It has been my honor to speak this evening, and I thank my brother and his DNA and wish him to know, he has ancestors who have discovered this great truth and have propelled him in the right direction; and this also applies to many of you. What a wonderful thing! 
  
I share with you this prayer, this opening to the love of God this evening. Free your mind from doubt, from skepticism, from intolerance, open your hearts that God may bless our souls. With all my love and blessings, I shall step back and join you in this beautiful circle, in the love of God. 
  
I am your brother in Christ, an inhabitant of the celestial heavens, your eternal friend, Yogananda. God bless you.
