# The Truth of Divine Love

November 7<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Rock Hill, SC, USA

John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, I am John, your beloved. I come to speak about the Truth of Divine Love and its growth within your souls. Each moment that you allow your souls’ longings to ascend to the Father, brings you closer, closer to the truth of living this love. It brings you more into harmony with our Heavenly Father. It brings you more into alignment with all the laws of the universe and in those moments, those laws are working to assist you for your highest good.

It takes practice, focus to remain open even after you leave this prayer circle but the more you practice, the more you stay open, the more you allow your longings to ascend to God, the more love you receive and that law of love encompasses all other laws which brings you to a condition and service to our Creator. It brings you the peace and the comfort. It brings you into alignment and you are who you are at that moment in your highest form. So try as much as you can to stay open and allow those longings to go to God that you may walk this path in total harmony and receive all of the blessings that come with that.

It is a discipline, a practice and you all will achieve it at some point for such is the nature of this Divine Love that brings you closer and closer to that harmony. May God bless you. My love is with you. The Father’s love is always, always with you and may you be open to it always. I am John Hughes and I love you, dearly. May God bless you.
