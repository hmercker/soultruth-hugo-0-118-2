May the spirit of God’s love be with you. May His holy presence fill your souls and bring the light of Divine Love into this circle. Each one here desiring the company of angels and their guidance and the understanding of truth. Each one wishing to be free from doubt and fear. Each one longing to walk in the light, in the love, in faith. 
   
As you live your lives on earth and the laws of cause and effect are in play on a daily basis, generally one considers the effect of their actions whether it be towards another or accumulating the things that they feel are necessary comforts and also things that bring them a sense of peace. You have come to this circle in prayer and the effects of your prayers are the inflowing of God’s essence, His love, into your souls. And though it may not seem at first as a connection that is lasting, your souls know it is an eternal connection of endless love. 
   
As there is cause and effect in the human life and with material things, in spirit it is quite a different matter. There are many things on the earth plane that have no equivalence in spirit. This is why we advise each soul to consider the things of spirit and the life that awaits you. The things of this earth, necessary as they are, accept them humbly, gratefully, as you would accept acclaim, with modesty. For God knows your true worth and I say to each one, you are worthy, you are loved. As you pray and you open up your heart, sometimes concerned that you will expose the darkness that you feel is part of you, please know that the light of God’s love outshines the darkness, is more powerful than any negative force. So, let your light shine, be of good cheer, trust in God, and pray. 
   
With all my love and the company of so many, we bless you and God blesses you. Go in peace. I love you. I am your brother, Jesus.
