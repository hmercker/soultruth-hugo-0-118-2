# Trust More, Gain Greater Consciousness

June 30<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

…invigorated by your prayers, beloved souls. Even though you sit as a small group, your efforts and prayers have touched many in the world. Your loved ones, those who are connected to these Circles of Light, those of you who are leading others toward the Truth of God’s Love, you continue in your work. even though you may be cloistered in this one place, you are indeed being active as God’s active agents around the world.

Continue to make those bonds and connections with others. Continue to walk in the world as a light. Continue to have faith that you will indeed be God’s instruments wherever you go and whatever you are doing. Every moment you may be God’s instruments. Every moment is a valuable and precious gift. As you continue to pray to be used as God’s instruments, so those prayers will be answered. So few understand this concept, this truth that as this Lattice of Light is woven around the globe, it facilitates the sharing, the beautiful blessings through this conduit, the many conduits that are this Lattice of Light.

Do not hamper these efforts by taking for granted the blessings and gifts that are given to you with each breath. Rather, bring forward your gratitude and your desire to be used as God’s instruments and to have joy in the recognition of it, to be freed by the restrictions of your minds and liberated by the openness and expansion of your soul, and that awareness that we are working so diligently to assist you to cultivate and to become familiar with, the soul consciousness. For all these things are activated by the soul, the soul in relationship with God. It is not your mindful understanding of things that is particularly useful. Although certainly to you, it is that centre of awareness you cherish greatly and you utilise often. Yet, there is something deeper, more profound that is coming to you and your awareness, and this is what we are engaged in cultivating and developing.  In this cultivation and development will come many gifts including mediumship, certainly, the capacity to communicate with us and to communicate with God. For when you have come to that place, then you are well on your way to be an effective and powerful instrument for the Will of God and God’s plan for the salvation of humanity.

Often the greatest impediment is the lack of focus and discipline, putting aside the desires and distractions of the mind and going deep within your soul. These instruments who have helped you go into your soul have utilised creative ways in order to do so and I congratulate you on these efforts. Still the mind is engaged, but as you trust more, as you go deeper into consciousness, as you relax into your own true self, you will find that the soul consciousness will emerge and be a comfortable and familiar place as you pray, meditate and contemplate.

You must learn these things. If you are to be teachers and healers, if you are to be God’s instruments and channels of love, then it is important that you learn these things, to come within yourself to be in that place that is connected and in relationship with God, that is connected and in relationship with one another through the great Lattice of Light that is a part of you. Do not put off this endeavour. Rather, focus upon it. Take this focus with you when you leave this place. Think about how you have been brought to your soul in different ways and how you may utilise different ways in order to do it willingly within yourself. Spend time doing it, being it, experiencing the wonders of your soul. Trust in the capacity of your soul to truly bring your awareness, your understanding of truth, to the surface of your consciousness as your mind gives over to the beauty and wonderment of your soul.

My beloved friends, you are truly magnificent. You are truly loved. You have had experiences and situations, not only here but through your life, that lead you in this direction. God is guiding you. God continues to work upon you. The power of His Love transforming and opening the gifts within you. Have faith in the journey that you are embarked upon. Trust in what God is giving you. Acknowledge and honour the blessings that are upon you. In this, you will find your way. You will find your way, my beloved friends.

I am your teacher, Augustine. I am happy to speak to you today on a very important topic. For without truly understanding and coming into awareness, your very being, that part of you that is so vital and true, how may you proceed in the world other than how so many others do, not acknowledging that very vital part, not understanding or being in harmony with your own soul?

 Seek and ye shall find, my beloved and beautiful students. Knock on the door of your soul and you will be able to enter therein. In this, you will find God, joy and love, beauty and many gifts, many gifts that shall be yours, free for the taking, free to be expressed, freely expanding in Love, the Love Divine, the Love of God. Ask for this in your prayers. Ask to be utilised, to be God’s channels of love. Ask that your gifts may flourish, expand and come forward into your consciousness. Ask that your soul may truly be part of your consciousness, truly the centre of your consciousness.

As you continue to receive the great Love of God, these prayers will be answered, the way will be shown and you will come to know truly what it is that you so long to know and understand. It comes with the breath of God, the embrace of His Love, the upliftment of the angels and your true desire to grow within your soul. May you be truly blessed, my beautiful students, Know that I love you and I am close. God bless you. God bless you, loved ones.
