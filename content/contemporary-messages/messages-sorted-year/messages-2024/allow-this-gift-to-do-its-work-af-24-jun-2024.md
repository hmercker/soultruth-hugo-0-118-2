# Allow this gift to do its work, this blessing of transformation for each one of you

June 24<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike 


My dear daughters have brought you a gift of a (gem) stone (for all participants) and I would urge you to carry them with you wherever you go while you are a part of this circle. They will help to be a channel, a conduit of blessings, healings to your body and spirit body. It will help you in your efforts to clear your mind and to be in alignment and attunement with your soul. I urge you to take this gift seriously, to honour it by carrying it with you. You need not pray at it or with it, but to be with it in your acceptance and merging of the blessing of the stone with your being. It may not bring any insight or idea of what it is doing, but we will be able to utilise these things for your benefit.

Welcome to this beautiful circle, something unique in the world. For at this moment there is nothing like this in the world. You are experiencing something exceptional and a great blessing from God. Allow this gift to do its work, this blessing of transformation of each one of you. Be open and receptive. Be prayerful and joyful. Be loving and harmonious. This is all that is required of you, beloved souls. The work will be done by us. It is for you to receive and to allow and to not let any conditions of the material or any conditions in your personal life that are distracting to enter into this place and, if possible, into the entire time that you are here, engaging in this beautiful circle. Be at peace and feel the love, for it is powerful here. Allow it to permeate, to take away any tensions, both mindful and physical and be unified in this beautiful light that God has brought and the angels sustain for each of you. God bless you. Barbara loves you, each one, beautiful souls, children of God. God bless you.
