# This Light is Reaching Corners It Hasn’t Reached Before

February 19<sup>th</sup>, 2024

One Nation Circle of Light, Tucson, AZ, USA

Joan of Arc, Mary & Anna received by Elizabeth Mack

**Joan of Arc:** I am here. I am Joan. My sister, I say to you, I will be with you. I will stand by your side and be with you. You may talk to me. You may call upon me. You may ask what you desire to know. I will be with you.

Our love will protect you, yours, mine and God's. You may not fear any longer. I am your guide now.

**Mary:** We have come to support you and to uplift you, because it is your desires and your will, in harmony with God's Will, that you be uplifted up above this human condition. It is true that a great, great light shines today, at this moment, because your souls are open, receiving and giving your love. The Father smiles down upon us, all of us, for this prayer is reaching far and wide. This light is reaching corners it has not reached before.

There are so many who are here to pray to God for His Love. God bless you for doing this, children of the Earth. God bless you.

**Anna:** I am a Celestial Angel. My soul is dedicated to God and has been for a very long time. I am happy to be with you, to pray with you among this enormous group of souls with Divine Love in them. It is an honour. I thank you for asking us to come en masse. My beloved brother Jesus comes with a blessing for all who seek God's Love. How glorious is Jesus. How his light shines bright.

I am your sister, Anna. Bless you.
