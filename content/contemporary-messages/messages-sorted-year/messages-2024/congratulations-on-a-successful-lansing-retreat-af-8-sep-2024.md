So, you wish to hear from the old sage, do you? Beloved daughter, God bless you for your innocence and your insistence. Yes, I have been with you all during your retreat and your prayerful times. We have been very pleased with your efforts, your sincerities and the light that you bring. This church that you came together within it (Unity Church), has been blessed by your efforts. They will feel that blessing and that blessing will be one that will last and give upliftment for those who attend. 

Do not be concerned for the individuals who have joined you in your Circle. Their hearts were touched and they felt that. Indeed, there are those who are strong-willed and strong of mind and have their ideas as to what took place in this Circle of Light of yours. That will always be the case, my beloved friends. There will be those seekers who are adamant about what they have experienced and what they know to be the truth. Yet, what brought them into that Circle? It is the soul yearning. It is the soul seeking. In time, what has been blessed upon those individuals will take fruit. The efforts made in the Circles of Light will have their effect upon them in time, in time. Be patient, beloveds.

Dear daughters, your efforts to bring a Circle of Light together in all its form, beauty and glory, this will be accomplished with your persistence and your desire to do so. Our dear son, he too is part of this. There are others that will come. Often these circles start very small, but they grow. You will be led to individuals, to seeking souls, and they will join you in your efforts. Another beautiful Circle of Light in your world. What a gift that will be to your world and your community. Indeed, as we build upon this gift and we come to you, as you pray in your consistency and your desire, then we shall be present. We shall come to be with you and to pray with you as we do now in this Circle of Light. 

The world is in great need of what can be given in these efforts. The world continues to languish in the darkness and you will bring the light. You will be a light. That light shall grow and shine and grow and shine, bringing comfort, truth and blessings to others. My beloved little birds, little birds of truth, as you flit about in your joyous ways, others shall join you as you spread your wings. Be that beautiful, beautiful bird of bright plumage and beautiful song, singing the praises of God in the light and love that is so much a part of your life and efforts together. 

Be joyful, beloved souls. Be joyful of your accomplishments, of your efforts and for what will come. For much is coming, beloveds. Much is coming and it will manifest in ways unexpected, ways that are truly glorious in the Light of God, in the Will of God, in God’s plan manifest through your lives and through your efforts, beloved souls. Be true to yourself. Be true to what you know is God’s Will working through you. With that confidence and desire, you will bring much forward into this world, beautiful instruments, channels of love, light beaming forth, God bless you.
Beloved children of God, you are indeed blessed. You shall indeed be blessed in the Truth of His Love, in the Light of His Truth, in the glory of His Touch. God bless you. Confucius loves you. Indeed, you call upon me and I come. Indeed, I call upon you and you gather. God bless you. I honour you in love. 

**Martha speaks**

Beloveds, I am Martha. You set the foundations for those who gathered. These foundations will last and help to create something beautiful for God. We are well- pleased with your efforts. Indeed, God is well pleased with your longings and prayers. All is, has been and will be given in love, peace and joy. These intrepid souls will continue to travel and bring the glorious light, the word of truth, the blessings of love wherever they go.

Beloved souls, continue to pray for these efforts and to be supportive in your thoughts, your love and all will flow in harmony. In accordance with God's Will and plan, all will manifest in light. Many souls will feel this and be exalted in love through the Hand of God upon them. God bless you. I am Martha. I love you all. I love you all. God bless you. 

**Jesus speaks**

I bring a gift to each one of you in recognition and appreciation for your efforts. A gift of peace, a gift of love for each of you. For you are truly loved and truly acknowledged. As you step forward in the Truth and glory of God’s Love, so you are blessed, beloveds. So, you are blessed. I am Jesus and I come to give you this blessing that shall reside with you evermore. A permanent gift of love, given in love. God bless you, beloved souls. Shine forth and be the light. God bless you. My love is with you always. God bless you.
