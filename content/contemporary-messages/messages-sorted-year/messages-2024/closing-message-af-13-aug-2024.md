Received by Al Fike 

I come to be with you. I am Peter. Yes, your lights have brightened since you have come together. Indeed you continue to grow in the Father’s Love, this endless journey, this passageway toward at-onement with God. As you grow in this love, there is a subtle change in your demeanour, your thinking and your focus as this love continues to inform  the journey of your expression as God’s children. This will continue to unfold in accordance to the efforts in prayers that you make in accordance with the blessings that infill your soul and the gifts that rise up and are expressed within you and through you. Each of you is finding your own way and coming to discover your own true self. As you continue to follow the prescribed path, the path that leads to at-onement with God, who and what you are in the world and in God’s eyes, will change and evolve. 

Have faith in this journey, my beloved friends. Have faith in yourself. Have faith in God’s blessings and God’s Love for you. Do not forsake what has been given, but acknowledge and reinforce it within your consciousness, your efforts and your expressions. Do not turn away from God, but continue to face the bright Light, the Love that is God, and bask in the glory of His Touch upon you. In this, you will find the journey shall be filled with awakenings, revelations and joy. God’s Love will find a way within you to open every path, portal and aspect of your being in relationship to what you are and how you have been created, the expression of your true self and all that is good, wholesome and beautiful that is within you, and expressed through you. 

I congratulate you on your time together, for making the effort, for being loving toward one another and supporting one another. All of you, including those who are not present at this moment, shall find a change has taken place, a shift of awareness, an inclusion of deeper wisdom, a capacity to love more fully. As you walk your path upon this world, continue in this journey, this direction toward God and all will unfold in the sweetness of His Love for you, in the fullness of your response to this Love, in the wonderment of the changes and transformation that are taking place within each of you. Know yourself, my beloved and beautiful children of God. Know yourself and be true to that knowing. Honour what God has created. Express the beauty that God has instilled within each one of you. Your gifts, your being, is unique and beautiful, powerful. You will be as you have been, God’s instruments. Except more so, as you walk upon this Path of Love. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Peter and I love you. I love each one of you. I honour you, for you are truly my brothers and sisters upon the path toward at-onement with God. God bless you, beloved souls. The journey just begins and it shall never end. The sense of joy trickles up into your consciousness, but that shall expand and multiply within you. The capacity to know truth, express truth and discern truth is just beginning to be a part of your consciousness. It shall be your guiding light and empower you as God’s instruments in the world. The love that burns bright within your soul is but the flame of a candle that shall grow in time into the brightness of a sun filling the universe with light. This is your destiny, my beloved and beautiful children of God. You shall fulfil it joyfully, wondrously and deeply in the power and grace of God’s Touch upon you. God bless you. I am Peter and I love you.
