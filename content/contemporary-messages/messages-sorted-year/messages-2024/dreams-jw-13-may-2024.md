I am here, your brother in the love of God. I am Khalil Gibran. The world has often been described by mystics as being a dream that if you can only awaken from and see the unconsciousness, the somnambulant sleep state of those walking around you and amongst you, you would either have the reaction of being terrified like being on a ship heading for an iceberg, or you would feel nothing but compassion, empathy, and perhaps even some pity. 

I should like to give you another point of view, for as the consideration of waking from the dream state is entirely valid and true to spiritual life and the desires of the seeker, there is also a great value in dreams. As I wrote on earth, you would not wish to wake up a slave from his dream of freedom, I say the deeper dream of awakening, the dream of at-onement, the dream of the best for humankind, the dream of a sustainable earth, and the awakening of every soul in the love of God is a conscious dream. 
   
I would point out two paintings you may be aware of - one by the artist Dali, *"The Persistence of Memory"* and another one by the artist Tanguy, *"The Rapidity of Sleep."* If one is to look at these paintings, they are somewhat beyond words and yet the effect is a kind of fluidity pointing to the dream state which is outside of time and where all kinds of images from the spirit world may be encountered. 

My point here is this; before you go into your sleep state, pray that your dreams are accompanied by angels. Pray that your dreams contain the highest aspirations of your soul. Pray that your dreams become reality. Pray your  dream awakens you and pray that God awakens your soul and fills it with the fulfillment of every dream, which is His love, there for the asking as this truth I know. May everyone in this circle and beyond receive this great blessing and the great healing that comes with the inflowing of Divine Love. 
   
And I say lastly to you, consider in your prayer, in your meditations completely relaxing as if going to the spirit world and dreaming with us in our love for you and Godâ€™s love for all. I thank you for allowing me to come and I shall promise my brother here to give him a poem as I know he so wishes to receive one. Dream on in the love of God. With all my love and blessings, I am your brother, in Christ, I am Khalil Gibran. God bless you.
