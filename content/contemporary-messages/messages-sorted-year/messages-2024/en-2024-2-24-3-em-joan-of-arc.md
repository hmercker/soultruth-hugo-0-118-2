# Instruction in How to Be

February 24<sup>th</sup>, 2024

One Nation Circle of Light, Tucson, AZ, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

… and, of course, much love. Look upon them as children of God, so that you may learn to respect and love them. For you love your Heavenly Father. You recognise that He loves you, each of you, and that He created everything with His Love. Look upon your brothers and sisters as created by God, created with love. See too this inside of you, the love with which you were created.

I am Joan. I come to help you see the love that is already available to you upon this Earth and to ask you to uplift your thoughts, to see this love that is all around you, to express the love within you throughout your day, toward your brothers and sisters and in everything that you do and see. You are gifted with much love. You are gifted in many ways. Keep your thoughts high. Look to the Father to bring you closer and enjoy those moments together with God.

You have much of God's grace about you. Focus on those things that you know are from God in the purest sense–that would be yourselves as well. Ask God to continue to enliven your soul and awaken all of the beauty within. Ask us to help you to raise your thoughts and manifest the love that you do have in every situation that you are in.

You will be surprised at the outcomes of your doing so. You will be surprised at the amount of love that you have within you. But do not stop there. Keep asking for more and more Love and keep expressing that Love. You will see how quickly your love grows, your beauty grows, your vitality grows and what you attract as a result of the expression of this love. Allow yourselves the joy of your love expressed and the joy of soul growth and communion with God.

My brothers and sisters, you are so beautiful. You truly have been touched by God. Acknowledge this, see this, appreciate it and express it. Much will change in your world as you do so. God bless you. I am Joan. You are doing well, each of you along your paths. God bless you. My love is with you and I am with you.
