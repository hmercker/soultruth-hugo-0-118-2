# It Is Our Mission to Assist You

Rock Hill, SC, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am Joan, Joan of Arc. I look upon my brothers and sisters here and I see such fortitude and strength of character as you plow through each day living upon this Earth that is so beleaguered by what you call the “human condition” and what we call misguidance, ignorance and lack of love for yourselves, for each other upon this Earth. We come and pray with you with the intention of uplifting you to a higher place, a higher condition that will allow you to readily, easily open your souls to receive the greatest gift, that sacred gift of the Essence of our Creator.

As we uplift you, as those negativities are set aside and you begin to feel the love pouring in as you begin to recognize who you truly are and how you desire to be,
we are grateful for your openness to receive these gifts from the Father that help you to see more clearly how your lives can be and will be better. We ask only that you pray more deeply, more sincerely and more frequently, that you call upon us to bring us forward to help you pray…and, we will come. For it is our mission to assist all you children upon the Earth and in the spirit world to step forward along your path towards your Heavenly Father. We are encouraged every time you pray. We are thankful to God for these opportunities to pray with you for we love you. We are here to assist you in every way possible in your journey home to our Heavenly Father.

There are many who are here now and we are uplifting you so we ask that you open your souls and ask the Father to help you open even wider to receive all of the blessings that are intended for you. His love for you is great. It is beyond measure, beyond comprehension. Allow yourselves the gift of receiving all that the Father has for you.

I am your sister, Joan and it is my pleasure to be here with you and to be of service to you on behalf of our Creator. May God bless you abundantly and may you be open to receive that abundance. God bless you.
