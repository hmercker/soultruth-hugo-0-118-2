Beloved souls, children of the Earth, children of God, I am Elijah and I come to speak to you today to help to inspire you towards greater spiritual light and vitality. For this is the most important thing you can do for yourself while you inhabit this earthly plane. It is something that is not common amongst humanity and this has been the great downfall of humanity. For now you suffer in your world from the conditions and the darkness that exists here because most of humanity has turned their gaze and their hearts from their Creator. They seek material well being, material distractions. They seek to replace the expression of love with the material gratifications that come from human invention. 

We have come to intervene, to help humanity come back to a place of light, harmony and love. For this is the destiny of humanity. Not to continue with these technological marvels and distractions to the point where all spirituality is lost, rather to help humanity seek balance, to help humanity understand who they truly are and what is within them. Within those gifts that exist that God has created in the soul, that these things may open and flourish. In that, the wisdom of the soul may come forth. The capacity to love may come forth, the wisdom of understanding truth, the ability to see life from the perspective of soul wisdom, soul understanding, soul awakening.

Light, my beloved and beautiful friends, emerges from a soul that has been awakened. The awakening of a soul comes from the inflowing of the Essence of God. In this, all things are possible as the individual comes to know their Creator, comes to understand the immensity and power of His Love for all of humanity. For every child upon the Earth this love is immense and is meant to be given as a gift. These energies, as you would call them, given freely and abundantly so that you may open the consciousness of your soul, so that you may see through the consciousness of your soul and put into perspective what life truly is and means. For many are lost in this understanding. 

Many do not understand anything in terms of the preciousness and importance of life, this beginning of a soul realised in the material body and creating within their life’s experience their own personality, their own being. God has put identity with soul and soul with identity so that the individual may be individualised. In this, they start an immense journey of experiences, of learning, of growing, of becoming truly fulfilled and understanding and acknowledging the gifts within, especially within the soul, that may be realised and expressed in the world. 

As you seek out this gift of Love, it ignites the awakening of these many gifts and faculties within. It purifies the soul, and all conditions that have been gathered and reside within you as a result of your life, but are not in harmony with love, begin to be healed and released from your being. Most often those who seek spiritually, seek to be purified. There are many on what we call the natural pathway in which their main goal is to be purified. Indeed the soul becomes purified by various ways and means that they have followed, but the soul does not go any further than this. 

Being in purity is a beautiful condition, a beautiful way of life, which is expressed within the sixth sphere of the spirit world. Yet what we speak of goes beyond this place. As one continues to grow in the Divine Love and the soul is infilled, expands and is transformed by this Love, this Essence of God, there is an opportunity to advance to the seventh sphere of spirit and, in time, to enter into the Celestial Kingdom, which is a different reality altogether.

My beloved friends, we come to speak to you because our desire is that all humanity may, indeed, progress into these Celestial spheres. Finding the ultimate joy and happiness that comes by residing within these beautiful places that God has made for each soul, provided they are in unity with God. 
 
So you begin a journey that may go either upon the path that will lead you to the purified soul where there is great light and beauty. Or, you may choose to go along the path of Divine Love, the Divine Path as we call it. There you may find the faculties and gifts of your soul ignited by the Divine Love, and all else within you that is not in harmony with this Love may fall away and you will know freedom from the human condition. You will know great joy. You will have great wisdom. You will have deep perceptions and you will know God like you cannot know God at this time, with understanding and the communion with your Heavenly Father, as we call Him, that will be deep and wide and wondrous. 

Do you desire this, beloved souls? Your souls desire communion with God. Yet, often it is your mind that determines the direction you may go in, how you may approach this longing that is deep within each one of you, this desire to be with God. It is your choice, for God does not push upon you any dictates or desires that He has for you to find at-onement with Him. No, you must discover God’s desire for you to be at-one. You must push beyond these barriers that exist in the human condition and you must find your way on a path, a journey that will bring great light and great blessings, great peace, great love and great joy. It is laid before you, my beloved and beautiful friends. It may come at your beck and call at any time. It is your choice. It is a gift given freely.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. Blessed with a great inflowing of God’s Love, the Essence of His Soul so that you may know of these things that I speak of and experience and live for yourself these wondrous gifts and blessings that God wishes to give to you freely and abundantly. 

I am Elijah and I am happy to come to you, beloved souls who seek. Many angels crowd around you at this time and you are, indeed, being blessed. Open, open yourselves. Put aside your mindful consciousness and feel the burning and yearning of your soul, that part that is in the center of yourself and you will know without a doubt that God loves you beyond measure, beyond measure, my friends. Feel this gift, this blessing, and know the peace that passes all understanding. God bless you. God bless you all, beloveds. I love you. God loves you. The angels love you.
