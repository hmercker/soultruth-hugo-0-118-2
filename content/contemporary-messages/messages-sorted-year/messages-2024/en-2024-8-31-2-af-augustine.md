# Establishing and Sustaining Rapport for Developing Mediums

August 31<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you. It is your teacher, Augustine, here. Precious students of truth, know that each one of you is sincere in your efforts. What is difficult for us is to penetrate the ethers of darkness that surround your world. We cannot do this on our own. It requires the Laws of Rapport in communication to be enacted. This is a two-way street, so to speak, our desire to communicate with you and your desire to communicate with us.

Indeed, that desire must be coupled with a soul yearning for the great gift from God, the Divine Love, thereby completing what you might call a circuit of communication and blessings between us. Certainly, our desire is strong, and we are well motivated. We do not have the earthly conditions to distract us from this motivation and these efforts. But you, on the other hand, are very often distracted. Thus, your efforts are piecemeal and inconsistent.

It is important for you to be consistent in your prayers, in that time that you set aside for communication and in that time, you set aside for God, for all of these things are interrelated. Yes, we say, “We are with you”. This is true. Our conscious connection with you is powerful. But, for you to know this and feel this within your consciousness requires this dedicated and consistent form of connection and rapport for the consciousness of knowing us, of feeling us and of being with us closely to be established within you.

It requires consistency and your efforts to be in the proper condition to be receptive to communication. We will make every effort on our end of things to facilitate this. You must make a great deal of effort as well, something that is a daily effort, something that is a conscious effort, something that utilises the laws that you have been taught. You are in a school, so to speak, a school of learning and development. If you are a good student, then you will apply the knowledge that has been given, test it out and find your way within this somewhat obscure passageway of experience. Clearing out the doubts, the fears, the assumptions, the judgments and the misconceptions is an important beginning.

Some of you have done a good job of this. Others still allow many mindful distractions to creep in. Be aware of this. Seek out clarity. Seek out that place of peace. When you are there, then apply your will, your desire, to be in the blessings and the grace of God. When you are aware of this grace, seek out the rapport of the angels, for they come hand in hand. When God's grace is present, when His Love flows, we are a part of this Love and these blessings. We flow with it. It is our natural environment.

If you are attuned to this, you make a close connection with your Creator soul to Soul. If your mind allows this and is not overly active and distracting, then I can assure you that you will know our presence well and that we will be close. You will feel that closeness. You will know who is close to you. You will sense our personalities, our presence and the signature of our being in close rapport with your being.

I know this sounds like a simple exercise, but indeed, as these ethers of darkness continue to close in and have their effects upon you and everyone else upon your world, it does become a challenge. We have great sympathy and compassion for your struggles. Yet, you know the key to this. I have just explained it from the perspective of spirit communication. If you practise this key each and every day, or more than once a day, if possible, if you establish the light within your prayer time and designate a place for this in prayer, then you increase the odds that we will be present in a conscious way.

Some of you will have greater gifts of awareness and consciousness of this presence. Some of you will have a more difficult time experiencing it. But all will experience it one way or another. All will have the opportunities and be given much latitude, many blessings and openings to experience these things. We will not withhold from you, my beloved friends. We will give and give and give until you have found and experienced what it is that you so desire.

God is blessing all these efforts. You are not on the wrong course, nor are you taking detours. You are experiencing the challenge of building a good and powerful rapport with your angel friends. As you persist, as you continue to take time and effort, as you have faith and as you grow with the Love within your soul, it will become easier. You will find your way upon a path that will widen, straighten and become less difficult.

Continue, beloved students of truth. Continue with your efforts. We will abide by these efforts, your desire and your dedication. In this, our efforts and dedication to establish rapport will be accomplished in time. Patience is required. Faith is required. Understanding the laws is required. Continue in your journeys and we will be there, I promise you that, never to leave.

God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. I love you all. God bless you.
