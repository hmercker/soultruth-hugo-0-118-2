Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I am with you now. I am your brother and Master of the Celestial Heavens. I am Jesus who first brought forth the gift of the Divine Love into this Earth plane. I come now to encourage you, to encourage you all to pray from the depths of your souls to be at one with your Heavenly Father, to open your souls as deeply as possible, as strongly as possible and then ask our Father to open you even wider and deeper. For He has much Love that is available to give to each one of you as you approach your missions, as you go out to your brothers and sisters, seeking to inform them of this love that is within your souls and of course, to express that love that they may feel it in their souls.

You are blessed among your brothers and sisters. You enjoy the rapport with we in the Celestial Heavens who guide you, who bring to you those things, those truths and those experiences to help you continue along your path. You are blessed. So, take note, open yourselves in every possible way. Have no preconceived ideas or expectations. Just go to our Father, present yourselves, opened and willing and allow God to guide you, to strengthen you, to activate those things within your souls that will be a benefit, not only to you but to those you are to teach, you are to show the way to, and to all of the people that they will also teach and to impact with their love. You are blessed. I bless you as my disciples. I bring to you the Father’s wishes to bestow His love upon each soul, not only upon this Earth but in the spirit world as well.

We implore you, go to the Father open and willing and allow Him to direct you. We are in support of you. We follow the Father’s will which is to support you, to help you, to guide you. But first, go to the Father and open yourselves completely. I am your brother and your friend and the Master of the Celestial Heavens. You are my disciples, and I love you dearly. I am Jesus and may my Father’s Love be with you at all times and may you be open at all times. God bless you, my beloved brothers and sisters. God bless you.
