May His Love be within you, my beloveds. I come, I am Jesus. You have spoken of me. You have drawn me into your circle with your prayers. You have drawn me with your thoughts and your desires. So, I come to be with you at this moment, to walk with you for a small time and to bring light to you all in the glory and wonderment of God's Touch upon us, His children. 
You are my brethren. You are my brethren. We are in the grace of God at this moment, unsullied by the human condition, the earthly conditions, but in the state of grace, which is Your Touch, dear Father, upon us. My beloveds, I am with you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to partake of the Father's Love, this banquet of blessings that is His Touch upon us all. This journey, this desire to grow and to be infused with His Love, never ends, beloveds.

I pray as you pray. I seek as you seek, for we are all upon the Path Eternal toward the glories of at-onement with God. We are indeed blessed, for we have found that path, each one of us in our own way, each one seeking, desiring and walking toward greater light, greater truth and greater love. We are blessed, beloveds. We are blessed. As this blessing is given to us and is bestowed upon our soul, so we discover the true depth and breadth of truth, of love and of light. We are aware and awaken to the fact that we are God's children, His creations, His beautiful handiwork. In this realisation, we come to appreciate and love ourselves, for we are truly beautiful, our souls unique and magnificent, a gem in the universe, sparkling with Love. 

My beloveds, walk upon this path with great dedication and affirmation. Walk with me, for I wish for you to walk with me and to be with me as I wish to be with you. That in our camaraderie, our friendship, our love for one another, we make a formidable force for love, that in time, with this light that is created, there are those who will come upon this path and find their way to this truth. For with light, those who seek are drawn. With truth, those who desire truth come to contemplate and listen. Most of all, those who are bereft of love and yet, within their soul, desire love, will find the benefit and blessings of the highest Love in the universe. God's Love for them will manifest and be blessed within the soul, awakening the true self.

May we continue on this journey, beloveds. You are all my disciples, for you carry the truth within you. You make great efforts to live the truth in your lives and you desire to speak the truth to your brothers and sisters. What more could I ask than this? What more could God ask of you than this? For it is in the living of this truth, the expression of this truth, that you demonstrate and show the truth to others. Be that instrument, that channel of love, my beloveds and allow the flow of His Love through you to touch others.

My beloveds, we are as one in the Light of God's Love and we shall walk this path together for all eternity. What wondrous blessing is this, beloveds, to be able to do so not just in the moments of your earthly time, but in all the eternity of time. We walk and are blessed in greater measure with each step forward upon the Path of Love.

God bless you, my beloveds. I bring you my blessing. I bring you peace. I bring you a touch of love, that you may find peace and know Love Eternal. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you always. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom and your friend. God bless you.


**Lotus Blossom**


Welcome, beloved and bright souls. I am Lotus Blossom and I come on the heels of our beloved Master to bring a blessing of healing to you all, to bring light into your homes, into your being, as a blessing from God. For each of us is a channel of blessings, those who inhabit the Celestial Kingdom and those who walk upon the Earth with deep aspirations to be that light in the world. Together, we are blessed in light.

The law dictates that those who seek light shall have light, and those who have light shall be a channel of light, glowing in all the darkness and all the disruptions that the earthly planes and spirit planes may have and display. We are a light, beloveds, in this darkness. We shall be that light, glowing ever brighter, ever more beautiful, challenging the darkness and bringing light where there was no light, bringing peace where there was no peace and bringing love where there was no love.

My beloved and beautiful friends, you are blessed and you bring a special blessing to the world because your souls are enlightened with the Father's Love. In this way, you bring a special love and a special light to the world and we angels in the Celestial Kingdom come to you to reinforce that light. With each one of you now, an angel is beside you and is blessing you. Open wide to these blessings, beloveds. Put aside any concerns and cares of the world and be truly in the grace of God.

We will be uplifted and so our soul shall open to more of the Father's Essence, instilling within us the Truth, the peace and the Love that is of God. God bless you, beloveds. I am Lotus Blossom and I love you all.

**Aaron**


I am here as well. I am Aaron. I come as the harbinger of truth and I wish for each one of you to carry truth as a flame within your minds, hearts and souls. For the power of truth shall transform the thinking and actions of men. The power of truth must remain alive and expressed through each one of you. The power of truth is meant to transform the world from error to light and all that is of light.

I urge you, beloveds, to put aside any doubt, to put aside any obstruction, to put aside any thoughts that are contrary to truth and to be that truth in your lives, in your being and to express it with every breath. As you carry the Love of God within you, so it is your duty to carry the truth in all that you do and all that you say, to be that light for God. That truth shall ring out into the world and challenge those who speak of error and live within error, that indeed as you speak truth with true compassion, true strength and true love, then you become the Harbinger.

The bell tolls in your presence and the souls around you will feel that tolling bell and be shaken and awoken with the blessing of desire for truth. Many will not listen, but there are some who will and those will be the blessed ones. As you are blessed, so shall they be blessed. Carry the flame of truth with you, beloved souls and do not allow any impingement upon this truth. As you tarry forward in your life, the truth will be a comfort. The truth will bring wisdom. The truth will direct your way and the truth will bring you to God.
God bless you, beloved souls. I am Aaron and my love is with you as many angels are in our midst and walk with each one of you. God bless you, beloved souls, in the Truth of God's Love.
