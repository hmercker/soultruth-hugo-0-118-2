# Allow God to be Connected to You

June 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

Blessed ones, I am your sister, Joan. Yes, I live in the Celestial Heavens with my brothers and sisters, contemporaries as you would call them. You are so blessed to be here to take these steps to become servants of God, to serve God and follow His Will in all that you do. You will be blessed mightily each step that you take in this direction of loving your brothers and sisters, of uplifting them, of bringing them forward, of channelling for them. God has prepared many surprises for each of you. You know God’s Love is great for each one of you.

You cannot imagine all that will occur but stay open. Remain willing. Trust in God and allow God to be connected to you, not only throughout these days in these Circles, but throughout your life, for you will be guided. You will be strong. You will be brought forward. There will be many, many who will follow because of the truth that you live. You each have a role in God’s plan. Remain close to God, always. You will bring many, many to Him.

I am your sister, Joan. I will be guiding you for a period, all of you. May the Father’s Love be with you. God bless you.
