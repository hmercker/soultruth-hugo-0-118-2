I am with you now. I am Joan of Arc. I come to bless you, all of you, with my love and bring to you the Fatherâ€™s blessings for you are all held in very high regard by all of us here in the spirit world, in the Celestial Kingdom and among our brothers and sisters from other worlds. We all join you in prayer, giving our love to our Heavenly Father, committing ourselves to do His will in assisting our brothers and sisters in the flesh in their progressions.

Call upon us. We are so very ready, so very willing, all of us, to assist you in your daily endeavors to express those gifts and that love that the Father has instilled within you. And you, for your part, willing that you are, to be channels of love, instruments for the Father, you have only to express those things within you, those things that are deep within you and will never leave you, those things that the Father knows will assist your brothers and sisters upon this Earth. You have only to express your love in this way. Many blessings follow, dear children. Many blessings await you, even as you are on this Earth plane. So, open your souls and express your love and ask us for our assistance. For we do so cherish you and love you, that we will come close to each one of you. We are healing you and will remain with you throughout this prayer, uplifting you, bringing you closer to the Source of all love. I thank you for listening and responding in love. I am your sister, Joan of Arc. God bless you.
