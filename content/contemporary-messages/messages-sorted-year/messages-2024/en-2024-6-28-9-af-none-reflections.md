Al Fike - Reflection on the Prayer Session

When you are being used as a channel, you have an agreement between you and the spirit so your spiritual part, not necessarily the soul because the soul is in agreement with God but the spirit is in agreement with whatever spirit is with you. That’s where the recognition comes. It doesn’t come from up here (the head). There is a sense down here (solar plexus) but the real recognition, the perception, the sense of the individual who is there with you, overshadowing you and all of that,  is coming from your spiritual side. That is vital. If you don’t have that recognition, a sense of the presence of a spirit, an angel, then you’re a bit lost when it comes to mediumship. You have to know with clarity and surety who is with you.

So we’re talking about trust. That’s where the trust comes in. You’re feeling connected and you’re feeling comfortable with the connection. If you’re not feeling comfortable with the connection, then you better just say, “move on. I am not interested.”

The first experience I (Al) had with the soul was when Barb talked about Divine Love with me and I was 20 or 21. I  felt a burning in my solar plexus. I felt a joy bubbling up, confirming that something had really happened here. Something shifted in my awareness. I was a pretty spiritual guy. I was walking along a path of more natural love  and healing, but feeling my soul was such a different thing. It had a physicality, a burning sensation in me that lasted for about a week. There are times  now when my soul has that burning feeling but often it just has a feeling of solidity, like it’s always there and it’s always right here (solar plexus) and it feels ever present. When I tune into that,I feel other things, I feel joy, vitality. Where the vitality of my body is diminishing, the vitality of my soul is increasing. The focus of my consciousness is more there (solar plexus area) rather than in my head and body. The spirit is dancing. It’s responding, feeling more alive. There’s a vitality there. It feels different from the soul. It feels like you’re dancing, like you’re really enjoying yourself and everything is in alignment. I think that sense of alignment comes from the spirit when you’re feeling expansive and alive. That’s your spirit being fully out there in your consciousness. It’s integrating all of you, the body, the mind, the soul, the spirit and it is in the spirit where the consciousness settles into that recognition, that awareness.

The soul consciousness is altogether different. This is my experience, I am not saying it is yours. It’s warm and feels like the wise old man in me. The wisdom and knowing is there. It seems unshakeable. It’s not speculation. It’s knowing. The mind can speculate all it wants. It’s just a dim reflection of the knowing in (the soul.) The mind puts the knowing into imagery and words. The spirit is an intermediary between the knowledge in the soul and the understanding in the mind. It goes through that passageway of spirit.

It took a long time to be able to discern those three places (soul, spirit and mind). The material mind and body is more present but the spirit and soul are the parts where I want to be. Prayer and effort get me to those places. But if you’re not feeling well or your mind is focussed on material issues, then that’s where the consciousness is. Consciousness shifts between all those parts within you, and the more it does that, the easier it is to shift. When you really know your soul, then the shifting of consciousness occurs at will. Yet, some people think they don’t know their souls but it’s more that you haven’t allowed your mind the joy and privilege of knowing your soul and recognizing it because the mind is too used to being in the framework of the material mind,  still not trusting those other parts. Not allowing their expression.

There’s a lack of surety and confidence in our usual mode of being that discounts soul awareness. Some of us pride ourselves in our mental gymnastics because we’ve gotten a lot of reinforcement (for our intelligence). As you go deeper, often itsl uncomfortable because there, surrounding the soul, is where there are impediments to this consciousness. But as an older person, I want to go to soul because there are increasing impediments in my body. You will get there (soul consciousness) eventually because you’re eager to do that and you get a lot of help to do it.

Question: So your body pain you don’t feel it when you’re in soul? In spirit?

Answer: When I’m channeling, I don’t and when I’m in prayer, I don’t. You change your mode of awareness although, if there is extreme discomfort, its difficult to ignore.
