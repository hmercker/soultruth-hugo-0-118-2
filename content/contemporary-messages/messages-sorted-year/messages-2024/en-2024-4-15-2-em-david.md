# Pray That Your Brothers and Sisters Have a Stronger Desire for Peace

April 15<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

David received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am David, your brother. Yes, David of the Bible. I come again to share in this prayer with you all. Such a beautiful light! Such a beautiful light that emanates from your souls and all together, you impact the entire Earth plane with your prayers, with the love within your souls. And you are bringing peace to this Earth as you pray for God’s gift of love into your souls.

This is a powerful gift, and your prayers bring more and more light to this Earth plane and even those souls who think they are in conflict with their neighbors or their so-called enemies, they are really in conflict within themselves, breaking the laws of love, fighting instead of loving. Your prayers for their souls will bring them peace which in turn will bring peace into the Earth plane. You practice this yourselves with your own brothers and sisters within this community, outside of this community, with those with whom you have contact and you may or may not disagree with them, but you practice your faith and your love in allowing them their beliefs while still loving them, soul to soul. This is peace for you and peace for them to the extent that they are open to receiving the love that you express to them.

Perhaps it would be wise to pray for your brothers and sisters to be open to receiving peace within their souls, to strengthen their desires for peace, that God will bless them within their souls with this stronger desire for peace that will bring to them what their desires are. We are invoking laws of the universe by praying for other souls to receive what they truly want. We are coming into alignment with God’s will by doing so and we, in the Celestial Heavens, have seen these laws in action among yourselves as well. For you would not be here. You would not know of this Divine Love. You would not be praying for this Divine Love had not these higher laws had been invoked on your behalf.

So, extend yourselves in prayer for your brothers and sisters. Pray that their desires will change and be for peace. Their souls really do choose peace, Desire peace. So, help them, by strengthening their desires for peace and you can see, you can observe the laws in action. I am your brother, David and I come to pray with you and deliver this message that is very timely. May God bless you. May God bless you and may peace rain upon this Earth. My love is with you. I will step back now and pray with you.
