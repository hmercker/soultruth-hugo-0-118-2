The boulders will turn to dust. The path will be made clear and lit by the Hand of God. For all those who are willing to walk the path of the grace of God, the awakenings of the soul that bring the vision, the understanding and the impetus to move forward, all obstructions shall be cleared and you will find your way without doubt or confusion. You will find your way with grace and confidence. You will be truly God’s children upon the Earth, so sorely in need of those who are of light, truth, strength and clarity. You shall move forward in the grace of God, the Light of God and the blessings of God. 

Beloved children, this I proclaim and this shall be so. I am Moses and I come to spur you forward along the road, and no dilly dallying along this way. You must stride forward in a pace that is in harmony with God’s Will, a timing that is meant to be. You will find yourselves truly in harmony with God’s plan and Will. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Moses and I love you. God bless you. God bless you
