# May We Be Transformed by the Gift of God’s Love

January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Trinidad

Received by Al Fike 

May the Father's Love be with you, beloved souls, children of God. I am Francis. You know me as Saint Francis of Assisi. I am an angel of Heaven. I so appreciate the sounds of the birds, the beauty of the natural setting that we are in. I have always had an affinity toward nature and God's creation. For these things are of God, as are you of God. The difference is that you possess a soul. Yes, there is great life and reflection of God's creation all around you in the natural world. Yet only you possess a soul and have this gift that allows you to become at-one with God. 

We come in these Circles of Light to teach you how you might find your way to your destiny. God has put within each one of you the destiny of at-onement that may be reached by your own volition and prayers to receive the great gift of Divine Love, this Essence of God to enter into your soul. It is an individual matter, beloved souls, for you to reach for God, for you to find God's Love with all its splendor, power and glory that may be given to you. For God's great desire is that you may desire this gift, that you may open yourself to the holy Touch of His great Soul upon you. 
We pray together, beloveds. We pray for the great gift. We ask with humility that God may touch our souls deeply, filling our souls abundantly with His Essence, that we may be changed and transformed by this gift, by the empowerment of the soul that is not there without this gift. You will be changed, healed and uplifted in ways that are beyond your imaginings at this time. You will find that you will see yourselves and the world differently. A great humility will be your demeanour. A great love will overshadow you and bring you close to God and wisdom will flow. There will be great and beautiful insights of truth. 

What can be more appealing, empowering and desirable than this? There is nothing in the material world that equals this. There is nothing in the spirit world that equals this, this gift given from God. This gift shown the way by the beloved Master Jesus when he walked the Earth, this gift that continues to be available to each one of you. I encourage you to seek this gift in prayer and supplication to your Heavenly Father. In this way God will give to you all that you desire, in accordance to the intensity and sincerity of your desire. Nothing is gained by sitting and waiting, by not engaging yourself with God. You must be present with God. Bring forth within you, in that innocence of soul, the desire to receive the gift, the gift that awaits you, each one of you. Everyone is worthy of this gift. No matter who you are, what you have done in the past, the present is what is important. It is allowing you to be gifted with this precious and beautiful inflowing of God's Love. 

In our silence, beloved souls, as you are surrounded by angels, as the great Light of God is pouring upon you all, may you ask in your hearts, may you ask *"Father awaken me in Your Love. May Your Love flow into our souls in great abundance. May we be redeemed in love, healed in love, awakened in love."* It is yours for the asking, beloveds. We encourage you to ask over and over again. You will find something so extraordinary, so beautiful that it will change your life irrevocably and put you on a path to at-onement with your Creator, something that your soul desires deeply, and will be fulfilled by the asking and the receiving of the gift. 

God bless you, beloveds. I am Saint Francis and I love you. We pray together. We are together. Many angels are with you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you deeply in this beautiful peace, in this beautiful light, in the beautiful sounds of nature and the breezes of God's breath upon us. God bless you. God bless you all.
