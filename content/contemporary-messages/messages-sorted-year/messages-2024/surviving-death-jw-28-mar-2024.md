# Surviving Death with the Perceptions of Eternity 

March 28<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your sister in Christ. I am Care. I see the kindness in this circle and the great desire for freedom in the love of God and I must tell you, if you do not already know or are aware of this, that those of us here that you call on, that you read from, that you are inspired by, we are overjoyed to be at your service. We are eternally grateful for whatever gifts we have given and those we continue to be able to give, thanks to your openness and willingness to receive. 

For every human has free will and the will to survive is built into the human condition. Once you truly discover that you will survive beyond the human condition into these realms of spirit that you are so fond of reading about and driven by your souls’ longings to be transformed and enter upon the Celestial Kingdom you will be free. 
  
These perceptions of your souls allow them to nourish you, to sustain you for your time on earth and as you are inspired to give and to serve, we are inspired to give and to serve you in whatever way we can. As you begin to feel the love of God and His grace, as you open up your hearts and God touches your souls, you begin to have the perceptions of eternity in the higher vibrations that is the grace of God connecting you to us in the Celestial realms and as we have said, this is the bridge between heaven and earth. It is God’s gift to you. Isn’t it wonderful? 
  
We are smiling upon you. God is blessing you and so many are here in this moment to thank you. May you carry this love of God with you into your night and day tomorrow and remember us for we shall not forget you and we love you. With all my love and blessings, I believe I can say with permission from my sister Claire, my dear kind mice, God loves you. May God bless you and may His grace and peace be yours, always. I am Care.
