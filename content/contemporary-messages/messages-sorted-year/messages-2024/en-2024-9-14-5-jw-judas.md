# Call on Us When You Are in Need

September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Penuel Ridge, TN, USA

Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

There are so many here and we wanted to allow our new brother to speak because what he wanted to contribute was within alignment with the Master’s message and the greater work that we do. My brother here has asked me always to give practical advice and leave the minutiae and details to others and to the brother in Ecuador who was able to receive some wonderful truths. He would often become so enamored with the details, the specifics and I would provide the best I could to him and then bring him around to practical advice of receiving God’s love. So, when I speak through this one who prefers simple messages and not only me but other Celestials, we honor his wishes and give him what we consider practical advice.

So, in alignment with what has been received today and what was just received from brother Fred, is it not practical to call a friend when you are in need as we are your friends in the Celestial Heavens, please remember how practical it is for you to call on us when you are in need. I told my brother yesterday, “We are amazed that how often when one is in a dilemma, a crisis, debating what to do and we are available for help.” You know when you ask God to make things clear, we are given that and we come and speak to you, sometimes in dreams, when you are more available and regularly through these brother and sister and others.

We delight in this work. How many souls around the world do you think are asking for our help. The numbers are relatively small, the upside of which is, the number of souls praying to receive the love of God is quite large and ever growing. Despite what appears to be a world in darkness, there are many praying in their own way for change, for transformation, for freedom, for a blessing. So, you are in alignment with many souls in heaven and under, and your wishes and your visions will become reality despite the birth pains, the labor pains that the world must go through to deliver this new birth, this new reality.

I tell you, do not be concerned about the time. Know that whatever you do in service is felt and appreciated and please know you are all worthy. There is no unworthiness in the Father’s love. All are worthy. Only your belief that you have missed the mark, not done enough, faltered in some way, holds you back. Allow is not the word you use. Allow this grace. Allow this love to permeate your soul because I tell you, at some point, if you allow, it will permeate your very being. You will feel as if the lightbulb and as the brother’s song goes, *“Sing an ode to the Holy One, shining like a million suns with a love that makes us one. We are all one in the love of God.”*

I thank you. I shall step back and be in this beautiful circle of such beloved souls so cherished by the Heavenly Father, so blessed you are. Let us be in the Holy Presence, in the grace and love of our Creator. I thank you. I am Judas, once of Kerioth, now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom and your eternal brother and friend in Christ. God bless you. Go in peace. Go in peace.
