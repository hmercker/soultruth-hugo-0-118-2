# Trust What You Have Been Given

April 7<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

Augustine received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here in the love of our Heavenly Father, that Christ spirit that permeates this gathering of beautiful souls. I am your brother, Augustine and I and many of my brethren join you in your prayers and uplift you and bring to you our love which grows as does yours each time you open your souls to the Heavenly Father’s love. We stand beside you. We encourage you. We love you. We guide you. All of this you will appreciate more as you continue to grow in this love.

Of these qualities and gifts, one which you may choose to grow even more is your faith. Your faith in the Heavenly Father’s provisions, guidance, love for you. For faith will bring you closer, closer to the fountainhead of this Essence of Divine Love, faith in your abilities as well as faith in God. Trust what you have been given. Seek to know what it is that you have been given and allow what you have been given to come forward in service and in honor to your Father, your Creator who blesses you every moment of your existence.

Come to know God’s goodness, God’s blessings upon you, upon your brothers and sisters. Seek to know the truth that lies within you that is available to you. Seek more of the Father’s blessings. You know as you seek, you shall be given. This is a law and with your faith enacted, you will activate the love within you to express all that you have within you and to connect with your Creator, our Holy Heavenly Father.

May God bless you, each one of you. May your souls open wide and may you receive the Essence of your Creator’s Soul now and always. I am your brother, your servant, your teacher. I am Augustine and it is my pleasure to serve you today. May the Father’s Love pour upon you and grant you the vitality of soul that is possible for each and every one of you. God bless you. God bless you, dear children of God. May God bless you.
