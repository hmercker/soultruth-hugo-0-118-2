# Grief and Love 

January 12<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, Care. I come in the love of God. 
 
Although I had promised my dear Jimbeau to deliver a message today of another sort, I shall begin by stating this.  The grief that one suffers when losing a loved one is difficult to describe but to those that have felt it, easy to empathize with, for all have lost someone or something dear to them. 
  
When I passed over, very quickly, I found bliss and joy in the comfort of the angels who greeted me, and brother Jesus came which was the fulfillment of every wish I could have ever had on earth. Those who pass into spirit, who don’t carry a lot of baggage, who haven’t led a negative existence are greeted by loved ones and if they have one in their family who has become a celestial angel, they will be greeted by that celestial. 

When one passes quickly though, it is traumatic to those left behind and it is a great blessing for those who cross over. Those who are left behind in their grief must learn to live in the love that was shared and let go of the one who is now in spirit so that they may progress. This does not mean of ever letting go of the deep love and affection that one holds for another, **but it does mean to let go of grief, for grief binds the one in spirit to the one on earth and can often hinder their progression out of their concern for that one or one’s left behind.** 
    
Sometimes those left behind are what we would call *‘inconsolable’* and so we always wish to encourage them to be in a state of love with the departed, to remember love and to send love and light, so that the soul in spirit may feel free to progress and watch over them with ever more love in that progression. I cannot tell you how great the importance of this is, for it allows progression on both sides, in spirit and on earth. Spiritual progression, which you all desire and which we in spirit know, is endless. So let us embrace those in mourning. Let us praise and celebrate the lives of those who have crossed over, that they may wish to progress to the fountainhead of God’s love, and that all prayers may ascend to our Heavenly Father. 
  
It had been my spirit assignment at one time to greet those crossing over and it was a wonderful opportunity to serve, as I found much joy in being able to comfort and console and pray with those that were in my charge. You all must know of course that crossing over into spirit upon the death of the mortal body, is the fate of all who live on earth and that each life continues in spirit. For those on the path of divine love, especially those who have relatives, relations, friends on that path to help them, there is so much joy, so much gratitude, so much warmth to be felt in the magnetism of God’s love towards all His children. 
 
So rejoice in the knowing that those who we love are all held in the Father’s embrace, and it only takes a request from their soul for them to receive His grace. 
 
I shall come again to speak on what I wished to talk about today, but I feel it is important to join you now, to remind you to send love, to remind you to live love, to sing love, to speak love, to give love to all. 

I love you all and wish the peace of God’s love to be upon you, that your souls may be transformed, that your hearts may be lifted in the joy and the wonder and the magnificence of God’s creation. What a wonder it is to be a soul and to be changed and to be at one with our Creator! May God bless us all. I am Care.
