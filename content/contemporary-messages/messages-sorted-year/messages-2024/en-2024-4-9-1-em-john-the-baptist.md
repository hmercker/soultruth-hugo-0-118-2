# Give Them the Foundation That They Require

April 9<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now, I am John the Baptist, and I thank you all for coming to enjoy the splendor of our Father’s Divine Love which right now is inflowing into our souls, all of us. I am here to bless you with my love and as I do so, my love becomes more powerful because my Father gives me more. I touch you each with my love given to me by my Father. So, you see the more you receive, the more you have to give. The more you give, the more you receive. This is important for in the future, the very near future, you will be asked to give, to give your love, to exercise your patience and your faith, for your brothers and sisters. For they will not understand.

There will be confusion, and you can tell them what the truth is. Give them the foundation that they require. For as these souls, these souls who have been seeking for a long time, they will be coming to you and you may enlighten them, not taking on their burdens but showing them how to give their burdens to God, helping them to feel what God’s love feels like as you express your love, as you choose to be channels of God’s love so that they may experience for themselves, this very special, unique Divine love and then, you can tell them. It is available to them by merely asking.

Help them to unburden themselves by pointing them to our Heavenly Father, the Creator who created them, who can heal them, who can help them. Yes, you will be busy, and the love will sustain you. You, dear true children of God, you are ready. You are ready and your brothers and sisters need you to point the way as did the Master when he was upon the Earth. God bless you, true children of God. God bless you in this work that you are doing and will be doing. The Father is mighty, mighty in His love and has so much love to give to each one of you and to all who come to Him. So, send them to the Father to receive the greatest gift that they can receive and rejoice with them.

God bless you, dear children of God. May the Father bless you mightily, steadily throughout your days as you walk your path and assist your brothers and sisters. May God bless you every step of the way. I am John, John the Baptist I was called. My love is with you and I, too along with my brothers and sisters, will be with you and you may call upon us at any point and we will come by your side and be with you even more closely. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you. May God bless you.
