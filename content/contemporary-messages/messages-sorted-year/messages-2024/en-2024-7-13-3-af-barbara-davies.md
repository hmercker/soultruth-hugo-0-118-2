Barbara Davies received by Al Fike

I have overseen this production of souls coming together, laughing joyously, growing in their souls, loving one another, all under the auspices of learning to serve God through mediumship. How delighted I am to have been a part of this, to see this unfold under such wise, spiritual guidance of my son and his partners in this endeavour.

You have all succeeded. You may not think so, but you have succeeded in accepting the Father's gifts within your souls. They have been planted and all you need to do is pray. Pray so they may grow and express them in service to He who gave the seed to you.

We are over joyous at your progress, over joyous at the development of love between you, among you and within your souls. I congratulate each one of you for your jobs that you have done so far so well. There is more to come, and I am happy to watch it as it unfolds. You are dear to me, each and every one. You are so dear to me. I thank you for your efforts.

May God bless you. May you continue to come to be at one with the Father and be the bliss that you can be in communing with the Creator. I thank you, dear children. I love you and I will be watching. I may even be whispering in your ears, so listen carefully. I am Barbara. May God bless you. May God bless you, dear ones.
