George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, your brother, George Stokes and I bring my blessings to you and my brother from another planet who has been with us before, your friend, who you used to call, “George,” is joining us in this prayer today and desires to speak to everyone here and bring his blessings from far away into your hearts, your minds and your souls.

God bless you children of God. I am one also. On my planet there is much of His love that is in the atmosphere, so much that we willingly, joyfully interact, absorb, accept, receive all that the Father has to give to us. We do not hold back in any way from receiving this love and from sharing it with our brothers and sisters. This, too, is something you will learn as you continue along this path of love; giving love, receiving love, accepting all that God has to give to us. It is a joyful journey, one that you seem to struggle with sometimes. But that is only because you have those conditions within you that need to be removed completely. And they will be with your prayers. And yes, it will take some amount of praying to remove some of those things, those burdens that you carry. But we are with you to help you, support you, encourage you as are your brothers and sisters, formerly of the Earth plane and now in those spheres that you call the Celestial Kingdom, and of course, the Father’s love, always present, always available, ready to nurture your souls, ready to uplift you, to bring you closer, to bring you joy and such happiness that you have never known before.

Open children, open. For He blesses you now greatly, immensely, purposefully, to raise you above the human condition, to bring you closer to His loving embrace. Open wide and step into this river of love. I am thankful to be here with you.  So pleased to express this love in this way of helping you feel the Father’s love. We all are here to help you feel this love and bring you closer. God bless you. God bless you beautiful, beautiful souls, so beautiful. I am so thankful to our Father for allowing me to be here with you. God bless you. God bless you. Feel His arms around you and the mighty river flows.
