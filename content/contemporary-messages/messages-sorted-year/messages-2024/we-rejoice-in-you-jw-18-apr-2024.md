# We Rejoice in You 

April 18<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

My dear, kind mice, it is I, Claire. I have been near, and I come whenever I can to this circle which is, in some ways, in my charge and I love each one who comes. Your explorations of the truths have brought you each wonderful clarity and have enabled you to not only help and support each other, but equipped and sanctioned you to disseminate truth to every soul you encounter that is open to receiving it. 

If you can lead even one soul into knocking on God’s door, opening their heart, asking for the blessing of Divine Love, you will have done something wondrous that reverberates throughout the heavens. We rejoice in every soul that opens to and is touched to receive God’s love, for we know the outcome, however long, however short of time, which is no matter here that that soul will be transformed, changed. What a beautiful gift! 
   
So, my dear ones, I am never far. I watch over you and when you call, we come.  I thank you for calling and whatever it is you need, please don’t hesitate to ask. I am at your service filled with joy in the love of God. All my love to each one. I am your sister in Christ, a redeemed soul, and your eternal friend. I am Claire. God bless you.
