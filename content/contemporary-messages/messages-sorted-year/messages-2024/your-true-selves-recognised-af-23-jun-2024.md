# Your True Selves Are Recognised

June 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike 


Students, Iâ€™m your teacher Augustine. You are stepping into something extraordinary. For the composition of your circle and your group comprises beautiful and bright souls that have many gifts and abilities. Together you will uphold one another and you will be utilised in surprising ways to help develop and bring forth these gifts. You will have many angels with you and we will work diligently to bring forth what is required and what has been asked of you.

Many of you will have experiences that you have not had before. Many of you will see through the gift of vision, come to understand truth in ways you have not experienced and visualised before. For in this circle, this beautiful Circle of Light, your souls will sing together as a beautiful choir for God. In this singing, you will come to recognise your true selves and the trueness in each one of you. There will be no second guessing, no mindful doubts and interactions that are not in harmony. Rather, as you enter into this beautiful space, this beautiful portal, this beautiful condition of light, your soul will feel so much at home, so much a part of you that the delineation between your mind and your soul will no longer be there. There will be a beautiful merging of consciousness so that you may truly take in and understand what is being taught, what is being developed, what is being gifted and blessed for each one of you.

What a beautiful opportunity you have been given, beloved souls, an opportunity that has been brought forward by the Will of God and the efforts of your angel friends. Use your time wisely and do not allow your preconceived ideas of what is to be to hold you back from what will be. For there will be surprises, awakenings and experiences like nothing you have had in the past. I make these promises to you, my beloved and beautiful students, because I see and I know that what each brings forward into the circle will be extraordinary, powerful and beautiful and in harmony with the truth of love. May you be blessed, beloved students, truly, uniquely and deeply.

Your teacher Augustine loves you and will continue to stand by your side and sing your praises to God. God bless you. God bless you all in this beautiful venture to serve humanity, to serve God as an intermediary between the two. God bless you, each one. God bless you.
