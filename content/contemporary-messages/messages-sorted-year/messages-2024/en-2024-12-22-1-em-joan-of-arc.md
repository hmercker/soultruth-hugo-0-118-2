# God's Blessing to Each of His Children

December 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, Joan. I come to wish you a Christmas filled with light and blessings from God, a Christmas that is shared across the entire world, that the love be extended to all of your brothers and sisters upon the Earth. There are so many souls who have light in them that God wishes to bless them with even more light during this season when they are more receptive and open to hearing God’s will for each of them.

That is the blessing that He gives to each of His children this Christmas, that each one hears, comes to know, become aware of the guidance they will be receiving to bring them further along their paths. This is a joyous time. Rejoice for there are many, many new souls who have come to this path because of the efforts made by those of you on this screen, those of you in the spirit world who have been actively teaching other spirits doing the Father’s will in the spirit world and many other of the Divine children who walk upon this Earth who know of this gift within their souls.

Much has been accomplished this year, especially in the recent time. For souls are opening where souls are being uplifted where the consciousness upon the Earth is changing, moving forward closer to that goal of God consciousness. Yes, there is much to rejoice about this season of blessings. And, the Father deeply loves, appreciates your efforts and acknowledges you as His true children, as His children of love. As he desires all of His children to reach this state of, we will call it, “Godliness,” it’s really partaking of the Father’s Love in their souls and as God anticipates that this will occur on this Earth knowing it will take some time, there will be many more, many, many more joining the ranks of those walking the path of Divine Love.

So let your hearts feel the joy, the fullness of the service that you have performed and God knows you will continue to provide opportunities for others to join you. Rejoice. Feel the fullness of having embraced the Father’s will and accomplished so much in this year. I, along with my brothers and sisters, hail you as true workers in the Kingdom of Love upon the Earth and we are grateful. We are grateful and we give you our love and thank you for your love. I am Joan. May your hearts be full of joy, of love not just for this season but well into your lives. May God bless you. My love and the love of thousands of Celestial Angels who are here is with you also. God bless you.
