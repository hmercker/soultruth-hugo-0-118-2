# It Is Your Turn, now is the Time

John the Baptist & Matthew received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am **John the Baptist**, and I come to join you in your prayers. For we can never pray too much to the Father of all of us. We can never love God too much. Honor this Father for He is the Soul who created all of us and brought us forward into the loving embrace. And it was a long time that we wandered upon this Earth without this gift. Many before me came and spoke to authority figures about their ways of living but now we know that love is the answer. Love is the healer. Anger, not so much. Hatred, not so much.

I voiced my opinion, loudly and clearly. I voiced God’s will that we repent and even that was not enough until my cousin and my brother came with the highest truth and shared it. And now, you, you blessed children, now it is your turn, and we watch you as you share the truth about God’s Divine Love, and we rejoice. We know there are so many more who can be turned to face the truth of God’s love to heal.

You may all have opportunities presented to you. In fact, they are being offered on a daily basis. Stay open so that you recognize them and allow us to help you in your expressions of this Divine Love. For you each have enough Divine Love in your souls now that you are motivated by this love to touch the souls of others who have not yet felt this love. You are and have been ready to follow the Master in his mission of teaching the truth of God, of God’s Soul, of God’s Divine Love and I walk with you. I am your brother and I and many others who have atoned for our sins and have become at-one with God’s will to find that that truly is the highest and best way to walk. So, open yourselves and stay open. Cherish every opportunity you’re given to share the love that you have in your souls and the knowledge of the truth of God and God’s Divine Love. I am your brother, John the Baptist. Come walk with me. I walk with you. We are one in this Love, and we will be with you as you walk this path. God bless you. God bless you, each and every one. And I love you. Thank you for sharing.

I am **Matthew**. I am a beloved follower of my Master, Jesus. How bright are the souls in this circle. How beautiful, how true are the souls in this circle. You shine brightly. Let your love shine outward to your brothers and sisters who have yet to feel what you feel in your souls. Have mercy and compassion for them. Touch their souls and their lives with your love and show them the way to their Heavenly Father. For now is the time and you are the souls to do this work. Some of you have been doing it and God bless you in the work that you do.

Let your love guide you. We, too, will be their but begin with your own love in your own soul and shine it brightly. Now is the time and you are the souls. My love is with you. God bless you. I am Matthew, your brother who lives high in the Celestial Heavens, close to my brothers and sisters who have a significant amount of love in their souls through prayer and service to our Father. God bless you.
