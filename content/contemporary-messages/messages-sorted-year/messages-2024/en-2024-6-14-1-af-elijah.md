# Pray to God to Redeem Your Soul

June 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Elijah received by Al Fike

If there is a reason for prayer, beloved and intrepid souls, it is to redeem your soul. To establish and open the way for God, the Essence of His Soul, to enter into yours. I am Elijah. I come to affirm the truth, to encourage you upon the road of truth, to affirm your efforts to bring the truth to humanity. For it is God’s plan and God’s Will to lay down the foundations of truth in all parts of your world, to establish this beautiful network of light, this Lattice of Light, in the world, to reclaim the world. For in many ways the world has been lost to God. For humanity, through desire and efforts, has claimed so much of God’s creation. Transformed it into their likeness, rather than following and adhering to the Laws of Creation.

God reclaims the world. Not through some great fiat, an event, but through each soul that aspires to have a relationship with the One who has created them. In this knowing the power of love to transform, heal and awaken, each of you aspires to be that transformative and powerful channel, that instrument for God, to help reclaim the world. Each of you feels the weight of responsibility, the weight of God’s desire to work through you and for you to be in alignment with that which is God’s Laws of Love and Harmony. It is important that you examine your own true self, your own life, who and what you are in the world. For without this self-examination, how can you proceed forward and be a clear and beautiful channel for God? Without the transformation of Love within your soul, how can you be an example, a transformative channel for God?

There is much work to do, not only within yourself, but in your life and upon this world. Each of you must learn to love one another unconditionally, without judgement. Without perceptions that say, “I wish for you to be in the image of my ideals, my perception.” Indeed, this is a very human way of going about things, but indeed this is error. It is for you to accept your brothers and sisters whether they are here with you today, or all brothers and sisters upon the planet, to accept them in love, unconditional love, to be without judgement, without malice, without any and all conditions that bring darkness rather than light, that brings distance rather than love.

My beloved and beautiful friends, we are here together to bring about change. We come from far off to assist you. To affirm for you that change is the only way the Earth can be reclaimed by God. For as it stands, God is distant from the Earth. Not His Love for the Earth, for it continues to flourish and flow toward the Earth. God’s consciousness of the Earth continues within Him. But God’s closeness to His creatures, to His beautiful, beautiful children is not present and requires His presence in order for change to happen. So, as you pray, as you desire to be close to God, then you are the active agent to draw God close, to bring God within the conditions of your world. That He may, indeed, bring the blessings forth in powerful and overt ways, in ways that the children of Earth may not deny God’s presence and in ways that touch deeply His children and inspire them toward change.

You are the agents for God and it is important that you acknowledge this, beloved souls. You have been touched deeply by God’s Hand. You are in the process of transformation. You are gaining light daily. Indeed, you must allow the consciousness of the soul and the consciousness of God to enter your daily life. Be that instrument that God requires to bring the change that is sorrowfully needed upon your world.

May you be blessed in love, blessed with a soul awakened, blessed with the strength and the humility, the grace and the light that comes with His Love. That you, your true self, will be fully realised, opened and expressed in this world. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Elijah and I love you dearly. For you are keepers of truth, the flame of love, the way of light. Truly be that individual. Walk upon the road of love and all will be given by God as you progress in the Light of Truth, in the Love of His grace and Touch upon you. God bless you. God bless you all, beloveds, in the peace that passes all understanding and all that is of God flowing upon you and opening you accordingly. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you.
