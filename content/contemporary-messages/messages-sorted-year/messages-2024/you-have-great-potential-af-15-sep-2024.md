Oh, beloved little birds, I come to greet you in love. I am Confucius and I come to congratulate you in your efforts in prayer, in being together as lights, of supporting one another. As you leave this little nest of love and you fly away home, you will carry the memories, the blessings and the light that you have created here together. God has brought to you into your midst a great light, a beautiful blessing of love. 

Yes, my little birds, each one needs some nurturing and some pampering to bring them to a place of readiness and effectiveness as God’s channels of love, singing their song sweetly and profusely, filling the air with love and light. My beloveds, you have been blessed, you shall be blessed and the blessings shall go on and on. It is a matter of your asking to receive, of being close to God. As the light grows within your souls, you will be formidable channels of love, light and truth in the world. 

So, you grow, my beloveds. The sparrow turns into an eagle and the eagle is powerful, able to fly to great heights and to be formidable in its presence as a winged creature. Your soul is like this. It must be formidable. Its feathers, its gifts, its expression regal and strong, yet loving and gentle. So, you are becoming the eagles. The beautiful, beautiful creations of God being transformed every moment. Every breath, you are being transformed by the Love of God. Soon you will spread your wings wide and mighty. You will have the confidence to enter into the air and fly high, closer to God, feeling the blessings of God’s radiant Love caressing you, strengthening you and inspiring you to go further and deeper. 

Beloveds, each of you have great potential. You are powerful in love and truth. Stand high. Spread your wings and beseech God to guide your way as His beautiful, beautiful souls resplendent in love. Can you not feel the burgeoning strength, the clarity that comes with a soul nurtured and strong, filled with light, grace and beauty? You are those creatures of love. Those souls that have found their Creator and seek the relationship of love, harmony, peace and truth. It is infilling, infilling your soul, bringing your soul into harmony and grace with God. 

You are each His creature and yet, you are each your own creature. This is the wonderment of God’s creation. He brings you together in the oneness and yet, you do not lose your individuality, who you are. That unique personality and being that you are, filled with unique and beautiful gifts, able to be expressed as the love grows within your souls awakening these gifts, awakening your true selves until you are ready to truly fly and be God’s instruments in the world. Without inhibition, without reluctance, but with enthusiasm, desire and willingness to spread your wings and express your true and beautiful self in the world. 

Acknowledge your strength, beloved souls. Acknowledge who you are and that God is guiding you and has a beautiful and wondrous plan for each one of you. Each one of you has the potential to help change the world from darkness to light, from error to truth, from all the pettiness and difficulties to that of love and harmony. Be that being. Live the truth. Walk the path and we shall be with you, beloveds. We shall be with you in all the glory and wonderment that you are. We shall be with you to encourage you to express these things, to be these things, to live these things with every breath you take. 

God bless you, beloveds. I bring joy. I bring strength. I bring love. God bless you. I am Confucius and indeed, my little birds, you sing sweetly and beautifully. God bless you. God bless you. In the grace of His Love, we are one.
