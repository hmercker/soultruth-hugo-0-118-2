There is the presence of God in your circle. It is also good that you come to understand the laws and how God has created the universe. For God has created the universe perfectly with order and with love. I am Andrew and I come to speak to you today, that the great compassion of God shall help you overcome all obstacles to your soul. That with the power of His love entering into your soul and the laws will be invoked that bring peace and open up many gifts within you. 

There is always a need for balance between your soul and your conscious mind until that wondrous day comes where the fruits of your labours are realised and your material consciousness and the consciousness of your soul merge into one. This is the power of God’s love working to those ends. Until that day comes, you will need to learn through your mental capacities and you will need to love through your soulful capacities. Together, do they not make a formidable force in your world, each one of you coming to that place of light and harmony, peace and wisdom, humility and grace? We work diligently to assist you to be in that place. 

Do not compare yourselves with one another. When you look to another and say, *“You must feed me,”* you are not taking responsibility for yourself to be fed by God. Be at peace and know that God will give to you all that you require, all the love and nurturance and blessings will come from your Creator. If someone in your circle has a gift of insight, a blessing, then indeed, open yourself and receive but do so with the innocence of a child, not expecting, not assessing but being open and receptive in the flow of love, peace and harmony.

Much will happen in this circle and things will be given to you from surprising sources. As you remain open you do not block those sources but are receptive and blessed by your brothers and sisters in the flesh, your brothers and sisters in spirit, your Celestial friends from heaven and most of all, from the Hand of God. All these things come in good time when you’re ready to receive, when you are open and willing. No one here is in a state, a condition where they have precluded the blessings and gifts offered to them. Each one of you is worthy of these blessings. So do not judge yourself or another but merely be grateful for what is given. Be humble. Be gentle with yourself and all will flow in accordance to the Will of God, the blessings of God, the upliftment from God. 

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Andrew and I love you. Each one, so beautiful, so unique, so much a light and so gifted. God bless you. God bless you all.
