# Welcome to New (Spirit) Souls to This Circle

February 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Beams of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John the Beloved. I welcome you back to your Circle of Light, Sunday night. I welcome those new souls who have come and all of the souls who are here, many of whom have come to pray with us.

I am your brother, John. I follow my master, Jesus. To those souls in the spirit world, I say to you, welcome. Come forward into this circle and join us as we lift our longings to God, asking for His Love to pour into our souls so that they may be redeemed. Blessings will pour upon you and this would be the beginning of an eternal lifetime.

You are new here and you see this Light. This Light comes from that Love, from the Father. You too may possess this Light. Open your souls, dear ones, and let the Love come in and brighten your souls. As we uplift you all, as we bring you closer to the Father, let your love flow out to God and open to what God has to give to you. Embrace with your love those gifts which are meant exclusively for each individual.

Blessings pour down upon this circle. Open your souls. I am your brother, John. We will pray with you now, strengthen your prayers and surround you with our love and our light. God bless you.
