May the breath of God be upon you, beloved souls, your soul's longing, opening, desiring the gift of His Love, awakening you and bringing you into that place of soul awareness and soul expression. I am Orion. I come to assure you that as the world changes, as conditions darken, as turmoil continues to intensify in your world, there are a great many who will come to assist you, uphold you and show you along the road toward harmony, peace and contentment.

How many in your world have this assurance, have this understanding of the journey that can be taken by each individual toward life in harmony, peace and love? Many might aspire toward this in their minds, but few truly understand from that place of soul. Few seek out this gift, this blessing, in a conscious way. Yet, within each one of you is the affirmation of this truth, the beautiful light that continues to glow and grow within you. You are each God's children, beautiful beings of light. May your light continue to cast its shadow upon many in your world, that you might be that channel of light and love for many.

All these things, this perspective of life, is a rarity in your world. Yet, it is what is so needed within your beautiful, beautiful planet. I urge you to shine on, beautiful souls. Shine on in your light, in your beauty and in your love so that others may benefit, that the world may benefit. As you do so, know that it is being reinforced, the light intensifies and the Love grows stronger. As you intend to be that instrument of light, so we are with you, so your angel friends are with you, so God's Hand is upon you. 

May you support one another, my friends. Continue to pray together. Continue to do so when possible in each other's presence. This is a beautiful way to encompass the world as you pray with this technology and this ability. 

The most powerful prayers are those when you are with God alone and with the intensity of soul longing. The second most powerful prayer is when you are with a group in the presence of one another and pray together. This is not far behind, this way that you are engaged in at this moment, to pray for the world, to pray for one another, to pray for the upliftment and awakening of your soul. This is a beautiful, powerful and very practical way to pray together. We indeed work hard to weave you together, this Lattice of Light, bring you into harmony with one another and make you one great beam of light for the world.

May you continue in your soul's progress. Beautiful, beautiful friends of God, children of God, friends of light and truth, we will continue in our journey. We are interconnected, bonded and powerful in this, this beautiful light that we share, this beautiful truth that we live by. We love you and you love us. In that love is a bond unbreakable and powerful. May we all be in that oneness with God, receiving this great gift which is given endlessly and shall be given endlessly for all eternity. God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. My love is with you, truly. My love is with you, beloved souls of light, love and truth.
