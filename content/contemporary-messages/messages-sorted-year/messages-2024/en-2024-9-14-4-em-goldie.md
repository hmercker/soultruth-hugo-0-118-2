Goldie received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Goldie. In your travels, when you meet one of us, one of us being a wee one, love that wee one. For that wee one needs the love to grow, to flower, to become what it is to become in this world that is rapidly changing. There are many sizes of children. Take into your hearts the wee ones, for they are the future of this planet.

I love you all so much. I am Goldie and I will be playing with you throughout the day today. May God bless you for the acknowledgement of the wee ones as well as the tall ones.
