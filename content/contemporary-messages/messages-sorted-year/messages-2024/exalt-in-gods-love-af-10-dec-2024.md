# Exalt in God’s Love

Received by Al Fike 

May the blessings of the Father's Love infill your souls. My beloved brothers and sisters, I am Jesus. I come to you now in prayer and love. My name long ago was Jeshua Ben Joseph. Even this is a somewhat distorted version of the Aramaic language. But now you call me Jesus and I am happy to respond to this name. I am happy to be with you, for to call me in any way brings me joy, that I might be close to my brothers and sisters and they may be close to me. For we all pray for the same gift, do we not?

I have not ceased in my prayers to receive the great gift of the Father's Love and nor have you, beloved souls. Nor have you. We are united in this longing, this desire to be gifted with the highest blessing of all, the Essence of God flowing into our souls, bringing its transformative touch upon us. That we may rise up in our light, in our condition, in our soul’s awareness and soul being. That we are truly coming closer to our Creator. That we are truly with our Creator, with longing hearts and souls to bring us into alignment with our Beloved. I am your brother and you are all part of my family, the seekers of truth, the wayfarers of light and love.

We gather together in the unity of this beautiful desire and acknowledgement of God. In God's grace and blessings, may we feel the peace that passes all understanding. In this condition of Love, may God bring us into that great Hall of Peace, that we may find respite there and we may find the quietude and beauty of God's Touch upon each one of us. As we are together in this place, we become God's instruments, channels for the world, for our loved ones, for our friends and family, for all who dwell on this Earth. For as you seek to be in alignment with God and seek to be touched by His Love, it follows that through your gifts, through your capacities as a soul, God may use you as a channel of love for others, that you are touched deeply, profoundly, with Love and that in this inflowing there is also a flowing through of love for others.

We sit in prayer for the world, for one another and for all those whom I have mentioned. This is a gift to the world. In your desire to be God's instruments, you too are deeply blessed and awakened by the great Touch of God upon your soul. Breathe deep, beloveds. Take in these Living Waters. Feel the peace heavy around you and yet bringing joy to your heart. Be in the grace of God. We are all unified in this. The angels surround you and I sit amongst you in prayer.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I love you. Beloved souls, I love you. Indeed, I am in love with God and in being in love with God, I am in love with all of life and in love with my brothers and sisters who are part of God's creation. My journey in life is love. All that I am, all that I share and all that is within me is love. I shall be that light, that bright star of love in the universe for all eternity. I beckon you forward to join me in this pantheon of light, love and grace that is God's Touch upon us.

God bless you, beloveds. I am with you and I truly love you. God bless you. God bless you. We are in the grace of beloved God’s Touch.
