John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Baptist. I come from far above in the Celestial Heavens. I come to bless you, each and every one of you, with my love, my care and concern for you as you walk this path that is so deliberate, so focused and so concentrated upon your soul's development. You are among the few in the world to pursue this path. You will see when you come over what a blessing it is to be upon this path, to be joined by many others who have taken this path directly to the Heavenly Father's Soul. You will see. You will know what a joy it is to be upon this path.

Yes, you have work to do, each of you. Take each step carefully, completely, fully in the grace of God. There is no rushing. It is one step at a time, one prayer at a time and one joining with the Father at a time. Enjoy this connection that you have with your Heavenly Father. Let your soul rise up to meet Him. Let it open wide completely to accept the gift and gifts that God has for each one of you. Allow this to happen in your lives, daily lives, as often as possible. You will be well on your way to seeing the fruits of your labour.

My love is with you. It is deep and it is great. I offer you my love and accept yours in return. I am your brother, John the Baptist. I will come again soon. God bless you. God bless you, deeply, significantly, truly. I thank my host for taking this message so clearly. God bless you.
