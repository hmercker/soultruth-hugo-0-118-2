# Know How to Ask

March 10<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Beams of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Mark received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Mark of the Bible. I beseech my brothers and sisters to go deeply into your souls and strengthen your longings. Strengthen those aspirations for the Father's Love, for the Truth is within that Love. The faith is within that Love. The guidance, the wisdom, is within that Love.

You see, my brothers and sisters, that Love is the highest gift, the greatest gift offered to each one of you for the asking. Know how to ask. Ask with your hearts. Ask with your souls and keep on asking, as the Father will grant you all the Love that you desire, all the progression that it is your will to accept. Dig deeply. Go deep into that unique part of yourselves. From there, reach up to God, your Father, your Creator, and ask. For as you ask, you shall receive.

My blessings are with you. I am your brother, Mark. I will remain in prayer with you. God bless you each and every one.
