Oh, my beloveds, I come. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you, to be with you in this time of gathering light, gathering light around yourselves and gathering light to this world. How you are needed to be channels of light and love in the world. How the world needs light to thrive, to be in harmony and to be at peace. It is important for you, each one, knowing the source of all light and love, to bring these blessings forth, to allow the flow of God's Love and Light into the world as you become His instruments, as you draw to your own soul the very Essence of God's Soul, as you bring into your lives the truth expressed and blessed within it.

Beloveds, we come together in this holy time of prayer to be those instruments of peace, to infill within us greater light and greater love. What greater service can you be of God than to be that instrument of peace and love in the world, whether it be your families, your loved ones, or the stranger on the street? To all you meet, beloveds, be that channel of love and light, for many will benefit from your presence. As you ask God that you might be His channel, His instrument, so God will use you in many ways and show you the path to tread and bring you into situations and conditions where light is needed and peace might prevail.

Do not doubt the power of your own soul, the power of God utilising each one of you to be that channel of love and light, to utilise your gifts to bring healing, to bring truth and to bring all that is good and is of God. You bring the angels close, my beloveds. You bring the angels with your prayers and desires. All that you feel within the very depths of your being draws the light and brings the truth. 

We are all God's instruments here. Together, we work to help heal the world, to help save the world from its own misdirected choices and conditions. We continue our work, beloveds. We continue diligently, steadfastly and with pure desire to bring light and to bring peace. 
May God bless you on this journey toward greater light, higher truth, that you might be a formidable instrument in the world and carry the torch of truth wherever you go. In this, I will be with you. In this, the angels surround you. So, we venture together into the dark corners of the world. As each individual soul continues to suffer and yearn for something higher and more in harmony, we venture toward them.

May God guide each one of us as we seek to serve, to seek to walk this path of light and seek for truth. As God's Love continues to awaken us, the power and beauty of our own souls and capacities to serve humanity will grow, deepen and strengthen. May we continue on this road together. I shall never leave you, beloveds. You are my brethren. You are part of this great family of love and we shall venture forth together in all the goodness, glory and wonderment that is God's Love for us and God's Love through us to the world.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus and you know that I love you. May you know how much I love you. Most of all, may you know how much God loves you. For in the nurturance of this love, you will be able to be the instruments of which I speak, beautiful, powerful and gracious instruments of truth in the world. God bless you. My love is with you. Beloved souls of God, we walk together for all eternity. God bless you, each one. God bless you.
