Cast out your doubts. Do not see yourselves as you once did, but see yourselves as you truly are. Do not falter in your spiritual progression, but awaken to the new dawn of your transforming self in truth and love. When you feel compelled to speak, speak. When you feel compelled to embrace another, embrace them. When you feel compelled to pray for your brothers and sisters, do so with all the strength, integrity, desire and love that you can muster.Â For these are the instruments that God wishes to have upon the Earth. Those who bravely step forward. Those who are not reluctant. Those who have cast aside fear and embrace faith and love. Those are the instruments God wishes to have upon the Earth. 

Each one of you, each one has the capacity, the light, the truth and the ability to be that instrument. Do not doubt yourselves, but be free in the Love of God, to be clear in the Love of God, to be awakened in the Love of God and transformed in the Love of God. In this way, you will be that individual, that instrument that is so needed in the world. Are you willing? Can you step forward in this way? Beloved students, I ask you sincerely. I implore you with love and concern, for the time grows short and you must be readied for what is to come. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I thank you for coming to this Circle of Light and for being eager and open, prayerful and loving. We shall continue in our education, our development and the strengthening of the light within you. I am Augustine, your teacher. I love you, beloved souls. I love you.
