# Soul Transformation in God’s love is real

May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

It is I, Care. I come in the love of God, in the company of many, to this very special circle of prayer filled with sincere longing, sincere soul aspirations, beyond, as the dear brother said, chatter. And as my beloved wrote, in my presence and with a little help from me, *“In a moment like this, who could resist a love so real and so true?”* 

For the touch of God’s hand is upon all, and every time your soul receives the essence of our Father, you are in a state of grace and with each prayer with each receiving, your soul progresses. You know the passion of one’s soul to be free, to be loved, to be changed that comes with each prayer brings the love of God, and in that moment of grace, whatever concerns you may have had, dissipate. 
     
As you progress more and more in your prayer life, you begin, as I did, to feel the love of God with your entire being. This feeling, this beginning gives each soul a window into the reality of the celestial kingdom, for even a drop of Divine Love puts you in the ocean of grace, of bliss. And I think ocean is a good term because as we often speak about being in this grace, we talk about fluidity, being in the flow of God’s love, in the will of the Creator, where even on earth one can see the great harmony that pervades and one begins to have a real sense that the weight of the world has no longer the ability to bring one’s spirit down, for the joy of the soul in this moment of God’s love is, as my dear sister Claire once said: *"weightless."* The soul living in the love of God is so lifted, so changed, that it becomes effulgent with the wonderful warmth and light of our Creator. 
      
We honor all here for your commitment, your dedication, and your beautiful progression that we see. What a joy! I thank you for allowing me this time in your beautiful circle and my beloved for taking this message. May the love of God be upon you all and His great peace and joy be yours. I am your sister in Christ and eternal friend. I am Care and I love you.
