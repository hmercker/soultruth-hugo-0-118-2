# Hurry Up and Wait

Orion received by Al Fike

God bless you, my friends, I am Orion. You have an expression in your culture called *“hurry up and wait!”* Indeed, we have encouraged you to hurry, to hurry toward God, to hurry toward your own soul’s realisation, blossoming in the great gift that God has to give to you. Often you feel like you are waiting for something, anything to happen in your life. That indeed, you are eager to serve. Yet, to the mind’s eye the opportunities for service are few and far between.

So, you hurry up and wait. This often brings consternation and frustration to you. Some of you have very full lives, busy “doing the work” as you call it. Some of you are engaged in this work to a degree, but it is not as fulfilling as you would expect. Your minds want greater outcomes, greater responsibilities, greater activities. Yet, even for those who are very busy indeed, the outcomes are not as dramatic as you would like, the responses from others not so encouraging or inspiring. I am not trying to be negative here in my perspective. I am just trying to help you with yours. That indeed the mind has great expectations of the work ahead. Yet often those expectations are not realised.

We speak of the soul, do we not? The soul does not hurry up and wait. The soul is as it is with God. The soul listens and the soul receives, the soul is blessed, the soul grows. Those restrictions around the soul will continue to fall away. Every moment is part of this process. There is no waiting involved. There is no frustration either. For the soul is eager and the soul has gratitude toward God, love toward God and all that God gives which is a tremendous amount. So, the soul awakens slowly, not because it is incapable of quick response, rather, is because the restrictions put around the soul and those that are implied by the material mind continue to slow the progress, continue to dampen the realisations, the blessings, the revelations, the changes that are happening within.

Your waiting is a mindful exercise. It is the mind’s way of exercising control and having control of the situation where the mind is comfortable with the depth, breadth and face of progress. It is unfortunately a reflection of the human condition which is all around you and within you. Yet do you not feel the progress that you have made? Do you not feel the soul in its gradual state of becoming liberated? For this is happening. We see it. Your angel friends see it. It is plainly evident to us, but not so much to you.

We must have patience with you, you must have patience with yourself and with God. It is, in this regard, a waiting game. For as you continue to exercise your free will and your capacities to restrict your spiritual progress, indeed we wait, and you wait. Our efforts daily are to help you, to encourage you, to inspire you so that waiting is not so onerous and so long. Indeed, if we had our way, you would have a meteoric rise to great heights of soul accomplishment and development. God does not restrict the inflowing of His Love, you do. For indeed, in the past it has been proven that there can be a great shift as what happened at the great Pentecost.

It is possible not to wait, my friends, but you continue to consider both your mind and your soul together in ways that are often contrary. You continue to wait even though you are frustrated. You continue to restrict, even though you say in your prayers you do not wish restriction. Humanity is a conglomerate of contradictions. This is the human way. It is fascinating to us who live in a world where contradictions do not exist, nor do dilemmas.


Indeed, we find it baffling and astounding how you comport yourselves in this world, even you who have such support, who have access to such truth, who have been given so much by so many including the great Hand of God upon you. You continue to contradict yourselves. I do not say this with blame or consternation. I say this as a parent. I wish that each one of you may avoid these contradictions, avoiding the contrariness within you. Indeed, to do so would require something almost miraculous, as what happened in the Pentecost. So, you seek the quick answer, even the Pentecostal experience. Yet, everything you do is contrary to this in a way that it would facilitate such an experience. Can you see yourself in this way, my friends? Did you hurry toward light? Yet, there is a great contradiction that you have toward light.

Oh, my beloved and beautiful friends, to see you suffer as you do, even though you compared to many do not suffer a great deal, you still suffer. How the world suffers because of the contrariness of the world. It is, I know, very difficult to help clarify for others the truth when so much within their minds is contrary and obstinate and suspicious. The struggle continues, my friends, for us, for you, for all the world. It will continue for many years to come. Yet, changes are coming as we have told you so, that will help alleviate this dreadful contrariness, this dreadful condition of darkness.

You continue to progress, my friends. You continue to fight the contrariness of your nature. You continue to pray and ask for help, and help is given abundantly. There are moments when you are not contrary and you do not contradict but are clear within the Light and Truth of God’s Love and the light and truth of your own being as a soul created by God. This we encourage you toward, this you encourage yourself toward. Yet, without this knowledge and appreciation of your own contrariness, you will continue to be your own worst enemy, so to speak.

You must look at the truth, to see it for what it is. It is not that you are bad, or unworthy, or that you are unloved. Though, this is often a place you go to when you see things that are not desirable within yourself. This too is error. Rather, you must have compassion for yourself, love yourself. Smother yourself in love. In this way, you will smother the flame of contrariness, and it will no longer exist. It is, shall I use a laughable term, contrary to often how you think. Yet, it is the way of God, it is the way of Truth, that love is the key, that love opens the door, love brings to you what you need to progress.

So, you shall, my friends. For you continue to desire love. This is not contrary within you. This is clear, abundantly so. You are well on your way to healing those parts of yourself that continue to hold you back, that continue to hold the darkness within. The darkness is not so great, the contrariness is not so great, but it still exists. It is time to let this go completely and utterly, so that you are free. This is what we wish for each one of you, complete freedom, complete light and purity, the transformation that will come as you continue to seek the Love of God. Be that light, my beloved friends. Do not doubt yourself, do not contradict yourself, but be the light, the truth and the love, and all will be well. I am your friend, Orion and I love you. I see the potential within you. I see how you make that progress step by step. Yes, it may seem slow. Yet, indeed my friends, compared to many others it is lightning speed. So you are not waiting so much. Indeed, your mind expects more. Well, answer your mind with the efforts from that of the soul. In time the mind will be well-satisfied. You will “deliver the goods” as you say. It will come to you.

I thank you for listening to me. I am your friend Orion. I will continue to speak to you when I have the opportunity because I love you so. My dear, dear friends, I love you so, even to be recognised by you. One such as myself who many refuse to acknowledge or see or understand. This is a great expression of love from you toward me and I appreciate it so. God bless you, my friends. I love you and you love Orion. How beautiful this is, how glorious in the Truth of Love. God bless you.
