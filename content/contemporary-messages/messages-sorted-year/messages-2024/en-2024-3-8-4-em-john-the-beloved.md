# Come to Know Your Own Abilities

March 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Online Prayer Circles, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I will step forward to speak to this congregation of beautiful souls. You have such Love in your souls, as [Goldie mentioned](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2024/en-2024-2-29-6-af-goldie/). You have beautiful Divine Love in your souls waiting to be expressed. So many gifts lie within your souls that are to be brought forward as you pray to the Father and ask Him to show you those gifts, to manifest those gifts, whether or not you are aware of them.

Children upon the Earth, whose souls are true and in alignment with the Father, you have such strength and such beauty. Come to know your own abilities, your own power that resides within your soul, this Love that is the Essence of our Creator. Seek deeply that which is within you. Open to yourselves that you may experience all that the Father has placed within you. This is truly the way to know your path. Ask the Father to help you to open wide and seek what is gifted to you.

You have my blessings. You have the blessings of many of the Celestial Angels who are here with you now. You have the blessings of our Creator. You are very wealthy indeed. You are very cherished. You are very loved. As Goldie says, be joyful. Celebrate what God has given to you and concern yourselves not about the future. Now is where you are. Seek the blessings within.

May God bless you ever so greatly. My love and the love of many who are here now is with you, upholding you, taking you by the hand at times, leading you and showing you the way. Remember, we are with you and always will be. God bless you. I am John the beloved.
