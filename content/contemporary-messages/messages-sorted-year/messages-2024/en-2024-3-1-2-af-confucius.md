Confucius received by Al Fike

I come to bring a blessing to you, beloveds. I am Confucius. To replenish your bodies and your spirits. To help calm your minds and bring peace. I come to bring the blessings of God to each of you. Precious souls upon the earthly plane who have their challenges and have their blessings of the body, the mind and the soul. God gifts you with many things. God opens many doors to you. Many do not hear, see or feel and ignore these blessings.

Yet you, my beloveds, you wish to know, feel and hear the blessings of God given to you.  Every moment, every breath, there is a blessing, a gift, an upliftment, there is love. God nurtures you with every breath. God loves you with every moment. When you are attuned to this, when you understand and absorb these blessings willingly and eagerly, then your life becomes a beautiful flow of love, light, peace, nourishment and truth. See your life in this light, beloved souls. For in this attitude and perception, all that comes to you is a blessing. Even though there may be challenges upon the road, you may learn and grow from these things. Even though there are unexpected difficulties, you may grow in love.

So much is given as a gift from God. Your life is a gift from God. Honor this gift, my beloveds. Walk the road towards greater light, greater love, greater knowledge and understanding of the truths, greater light. It comes to you unbidden, beloved souls. It comes to you when you yearn and long for it. For it is always there. It is for you to wake up and see for yourself the blessings that God has for each one of you. They are many, a multitude, a great tsunami of light, love and blessings pouring towards you, bringing you into higher light, grace, peace and joy.

May you be blessed, beloveds. I come to be with you in love. I am Confucius and I love you. Each one precious souls, pearls beyond price, pearls beyond price. God bless you and keep you in the light. It is for you, beloveds, your heritage. This light, this love, it is meant for you. God bless you. I love you, precious souls. Precious souls, I love you.
