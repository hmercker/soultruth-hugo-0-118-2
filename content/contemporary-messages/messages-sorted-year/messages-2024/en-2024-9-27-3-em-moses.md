# So Many in This World Need Divine Love Brought to Them

September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Marmora, ON, Canada

Moses received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am Moses and I come to join this Circle of Light. For it is a bright light that is brightened by the love in your souls, by your yearnings to be in truth, by your desires to serve. I tell you that our Creator will brighten your souls even more. Each of you is a light. Each of you may receive this gift that the Father offers to each of His children and together, dear children, you create an even brighter, stronger, more vibrant light that brightens the darkness that exists in this world. There are so many upon this Earth who need this light brought to them. You, dear children, those of you who experience this love, who yearn for truth, look to your Father, your Creator, and open yourselves to His Love that He may bless you in ways that you cannot imagine.

Allow this. Allow the love to flow into your souls. Allow yourselves to be uplifted. Allow those who are brighter to come to you and guide you and show you, for this is a law of the universe. This is a law of higher help coming based upon you, your desires, your willingness to allow this love to flow into your souls. There are many here. There are many here, some who are reaching out for this love, some souls who have been here and desire progression. We ask that you open your souls and receive from the God of all, the Creator of all, that you may assist these souls who desire to progress. You are all lights. It is a matter of your will, a matter of your desire.

I am your brother, Moses, and I extend my love to you. I ask that God bless each and every one of you to be open to receive all that God has to give to you, all the blessings, all the love that you may share with your brothers and sisters. May God bless you. May God bless each one of you.
