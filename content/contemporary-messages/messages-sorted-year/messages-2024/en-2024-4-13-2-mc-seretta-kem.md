Seretta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you. It is Seretta Kem. Over the past month, since we have been together and you have sat on your own or simultaneously with others, we have come and helped you with your development. One area that we have helped you with is the area of discernment. Discerning on the physical level, the mental level and the spiritual level and you are experiencing this. It is evident in the sharing. Some have experienced a great change in their dietary needs, their palate, and their appetite. Some have experienced pockets of thought patterns that have been alleviated from them which makes room for discerning truth and discerning the light of the soul.

So, we help you to nourish your body. We help you to nourish your thoughts. We prompt and help you of your own accord and efforts to be in a prayerful state and allow God to nourish your soul. This will bring more harmony to your experience in a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual way. These aspects of you work more in harmony. There is greater light that can permeate your material mind because of receiving God’s Love and also deciding to be in such a development circle as this. We can bring our gifts to you and work upon you.

So, in today’s session, we were working on the brain that has stored many patterns, habits and thoughts that operate within you unconsciously. It was a removal of a folder of sorts which makes room for a new folder of truth from your soul and its power of wisdom and discernment, with the desire of alignment to fill this space. And with this support, you will find making choices that are in alignment and of light much easier. For there is more detachment to the old. When you are attached to the material world, to certain things having a particular outcome, this inhibits the flow of light, the flow of love, and the law of love from moving through you. For within the law of love, part of this law is that the love received by God’s giving is also to be given, enacted, expressed and not to be stored away. As the barriers to love are removed, you will experience yourself in such a way which ignites the desire to have God use you as His instrument.

There can be a powerful sense of purpose by experiencing the flow of life, with God and love moving through you without barriers. As you well know these barriers are merely held within the material mind. We come for your development to help these barriers to be expiated and released, which will help you surrender to the purity of God’s Love and your very being then able to express what it is that God needs from you at any moment in time.

So not only do we come for the development of your mediumship gift, we come to support you as individuals, so that you can see these inhibitors within you but allow the attributes of the soul, such as compassion and understanding, to comfort these insecurities and to rise to demonstrate differently through your experiences. You become a secure soul within the realms of God’s Love. As you progress in this way, your instrumentality, whether you are sitting to receive our words or, more importantly, what you do within the many minutes and hours of your day, allows the beauty of your soul to shine forth in its power, its light in union and partnership with the Divine.

So beloved souls, embrace this opportunity and come to know the attributes of your soul and who you truly are. As you engage in these exercises, this helps you to feel and experience the qualities of your true self. Allow yourself to surrender into the depths of the ocean of love. I am Seretta Kem. God bless you.
