# Greatest Happiness Lies Between You and Our Heavenly Father

November 25<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Rock Hill, SC, USA

Michael the Archangel & John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am **Michael**. I live very high up (above) the Celestial Spheres and I serve my Father in all things. I am with you today to help uplift you, to provide protection, to strengthen you, each of you, to let you know that you are protected because it is the Fatherâ€™s Will that you be protected at this time and any time in which you are serving God, like me. You are protected.

We will not admonish anyone. We will serve God in every way He chooses us to do so and at this time you are all well protected. So go about your work for the Father with full faith that you are cared for and protected, with full faith in each step that you take and of course, pray when you have questions so you may get the highest answers, the greatest love and guidance. I am your brother, Michael and yes, I am an archangel and you are my charges, along with many others. Thank you for hearing me so well.

I am **John the Beloved**. We are here with you to pray with you, to uphold you, to help you receive and absorb the love, the light that is available to you as you pray. For prayer is the true way to find your greatest happiness. Your greatest happiness lies between you and our Heavenly Father. So again we ask you to pray more, pray deeply, continuously if you can and it will be a remarkable outcome in all that you do. We love you each and every one of you and feel so honored to be able to help you and be with you. I am your brother John the Beloved and we all will pray with you at this time and uplift you to that place of peace and contentment. God bless you.
