# The Benefits of Silence 

January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, Judas, your brother and friend. I come in the love of God, welcoming you to the new.
   
There is much to be said about the benefits of silence. For it is in silence that we speak to your souls and the language of the soul is Divine. It is not with the ear, the human ear, that these deeper answers come. The souls’ words that are blessed will surely inspire, will move one to prayer, to act on inspiration, to take that leap of faith, and to let all go that is not worthy of your soul’s journey in love; more particularly, in the love of God. 
   
During these times of celebration,<sup>1</sup> those of you who gather with family and friends may imbibe some spirits or perhaps the use of herbs, or just feast on the bountiful gifts from the soil. These things may break down barriers between families and friends who are not on the same path and sometimes these things buffer some of what you might call *‘blowback,’* from those who do not understand one another. So while you join in the celebration of these holy days, of the birth of the Master, of the re-bestowal of God’s love, remember first and foremost please, to go in prayer, to go in silence, where the love of God can speak to your soul. And then no matter what you may take in physically, you will radiate the light of grace without reaction, for the love of God is not an argument to be won, but a gift to be received. 
   
I wish to stress the importance of going deep, of allowing healing, of allowing expiation, of allowing oneself to be empty of concern, that God may fill your cup. There is the great peace, a promised peace, that comes when one exposes their hearts, their worries, their failures, and the human condition to God. Even your grief must be let go, not numbed by distractions, by addictions, or by overindulgence, but by transformation in the love of God. 
  
Many feel a certain letdown after a celebration and this is because with good intention and yet without clarity, they have overindulged in a material way, rather than in prayer, in receiving.  Short-term bliss and happiness is not a bad thing and it can in some instances create reunification with those who have fallen out with each other. But often this is a short-term solution and just as Francis<sup>2</sup> stated that all of his beliefs that were in error were superseded in the love of God, in prayer, so all these short-term remedies are superseded in the great soul celebration of the real substance of Divine Love that is the Essence of the Creator. 
    
So, find this silent place, let go, allow God to fill your cup. Carry that elixir into your family and friends as you love them as God has loved you and will always love you. Rejoice in the new year, in the new birth, and in the wonderful blessings that God has bestowed upon your souls. I shall step back and join you now in the silence, in the Presence, the Holy Presence. 
    
May God bless you with a great inflowing of His love. I am your brother in Christ, Judas. Go in peace.
