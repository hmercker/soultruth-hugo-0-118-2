Poughkeepsie, N.Y. U.S.A.

May universal light and love surround you all, my beautiful friends. I am Orion and I promised to speak and so I am here with you. Yes, you may call me an alien for those who do not know me, I am an alien being to them but for those who do know me, I am your friend and shall be a good friend, a loyal friend to all those who wish to befriend me. For what is friendship but the power of love shared between individuals. Indeed my world and my experience is all about love, all about the beauty and the power of the love that is in the universe expressed by the Creator.

I possess a light within my soul that allows me to be with you today. The Law of Attraction has brought me here. The Law of Love has ensured that my presence here is that of harmony. I am not here to subjugate, to dominate, to bring fear to your world. What would be the purpose of that? I believe that you have all experienced subjugation, domination, fear from your own kind from your world and how is this in your life, those conditions? I am sure they are very unpleasant, indeed. I come to help you see a new way, to understand the higher laws of the universe and to utilise those laws to bring greater harmony to yourself and to all. This is our goal and this is Godâ€™s plan, to bring individuals like yourselves together in light to teach them what harmony truly is, to teach them what love truly is. In this way, you will find the key to that which is needed in your world. 

The key is always love, love manifest, the intention of love, the expression of love and so you will walk upon this world as generators of love if you so desire this and wish to learn how this may be accomplished.

There is much to learn. You as a species have gained much in the way of technological advance and ideas expressed. The material world is yours for the asking and yet, do you really own the material world? You do not, my friends. It is gifted to you as a vehicle, an expression of life, your life and many other lives. But to have the arrogance that you own this world and that the world must be subjugated by your will and all the efforts that you make to utilise and expedite that which is in the world, is not in harmony with love.

When there is love, there is honour and there is respect.There is a desire to elevate and to create something more beautiful and more harmonious. It is time for humanity to understand these very simple concepts and to put them into place, to express them in all their simplicity and indeed, all their power to change, to heal and to transform the world. When you bring love into your heart and that love from God burning brightly within, you cannot help but express that love in harmonious ways. You will see the difference. You will feel the difference and you will step forward in your choices and your way of life that will be more in harmony with love and less inclined toward these human conditions that so dominate the Earth.

See yourself as a creation of God and in this, honour that creation. Honour who you truly are and the potentials that live within you. This is the first step toward truly evolving into a species that can bring harmony and in time will create a connection, a step forward where we may communicate and share and uphold one another. For we seek connection. We desire connection with our fellow human beings and we consider ourselves as human. We, like you, have a soul. We, like you, look similar and we are a creation of God. 

So what is the definition of friendship? It is that connection, that trust, that desire to be together in harmony, in light, in love. This is our desire. Is it yours? If it is, we will make every effort to connect with you and to be your friend, to help you and to uphold you in the truth that is universal, in the truth that starts and ends with love. We are here to help. We are here to be with you. We are here to help humanity overcome the obstacles and the conditions that keep them, all of you, in a terrible state of deprivation from God. Once you learn to overcome these obstacles, you will find great joy and happiness. In time, you will not need us or the others, the many other beings that seek to uphold you. You will do it all on your own. You will find great satisfaction, harmony and peace as you do this together.

Be of light, my friends. Be in harmony together and reach out for that universal Source which is God and you will find the answers to many questions. You will find the openings to many blessings and you will be transformed by this love. It is available to every human being whether they are on this planet or other planets. This love is available to every soul. Thank you for listening to me and I shall return and be with you and speak with you. There are Celestial Angels surrounding you all. These are the beings that have found the key and have brought the key into their lives and their light so that they are truly in harmony with God and they are here to help you, to assist you, to do the same. I thank you, my friends. May you travel the road of universal truth and universal love. Blessings to you. I am Orion. My love is with you.
