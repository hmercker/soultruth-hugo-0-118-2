# For the Earth and All its Creatures 

April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

Children of the earth, I come to you in the love of God. I am the first mother, Amon. I come on this day where thoughts wish to become things, where the desire for healing wishes to become manifest upon the beautiful earth. You have been told of many changes to come and many changes are coming but God will not allow the earth to perish, and we shall offer you not only our love, which is endless, but our protection and our guidance.       
   
Whatever you wish to do to make life on earth more peaceful, more sustainable, more loving, envision this and in your vision will come with the ways and means to accomplish these desires just as you have experienced in the manifestation of the great gift of God’s love in response to your wishes to receive it. For do you not all wish to receive the great gift of God’s love? And along with that wish, and your longings, comes not only the love of God, but our company, we who so joyously do the Creator’s bidding. We hold you close, for you are precious, precious souls. 
  
If you could see the light descending upon this circle and the light ascending from your circle, you would see what is the possibility of prayer being manifested. You would see beyond your earth unto the heavens, for as it has been said, your prayers and the love of God are the bridge between heaven and earth, one foot on the planet and one taking that step unto the heavens. 
    
The love of God truly is the very substance that transforms every soul. Allow God to bless you. Allow the inflowing of His love. Relax all tension, all concern. Give it to God and He will give you, His gift. On this day, we all pray for the earth and for all its creatures and inhabitants healing and we walk with you. I only remind you to remember to call. Did not Master Jesus say, *“Ask and you shall receive, knock and the door will be opened”?* Call on us. We shall come. I am honored to be allowed to speak today for there are many here. We shall step back and be in the love of God with you as you let go and you let God and allow your souls to ascend. May God bless you and bless this earth. I love you. I am Amon.
