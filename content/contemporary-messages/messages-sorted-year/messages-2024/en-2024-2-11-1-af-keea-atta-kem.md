# Harmonizing of Your Prayers Make Great Light

Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Keea Atta Kem. Harmonisation of your prayers together makes a great light in the world. As you come closer in mind and intention, as the light of your soul joins with the great gift of God’s Love, you make a formidable force together and the lights that you carry shine throughout the world. This is amplified by your brothers and sisters, by God’s touch, by the angels that surround you. That light growing and brightening by the influence and touch of God.

Much of the world is covered by this light through your efforts.  Much light expands out touching many, not because you have created this light, although you are part of it, but because God has utilised you to be His channels of light and love in the world. As God initiates and expresses this gift of light, we angels respond. You on the Earth respond. The bright spirits respond, and we together are enlivening the Lattice of Light in the world and each of you are holding that lattice up by your physical presence in the world.

This lattice continues to grow and strengthen by your efforts, your efforts with prayers each and every day, your efforts together as you make this commitment together. Pray for the world to pray, for your own soul’s awakening, to pray for the transformation that comes with God’s Love, to pray that God’s plan for the salvation of humanity may be realised and that love may glow in every heart and soul on this world of yours. This is what draws so many angels, beloved souls. If you count each individual here, multiplied by many more angels that are with you, so the force upon this world at this very moment is powerful and beautiful. It’s light deep with love.

My beloved friends, what you do as God’s instruments has its effects. Do not discount your efforts. Even though you may not see or know the effects that you have made in your prayers and efforts together, we see and know, and we wish to convey to you the importance of your efforts, the power of your efforts upon the world. Indeed, God has orchestrated this. God has ensured that many throughout the world are a part of this great network, the majority of which is not seen here today. But there is a great network of light and indeed, the Lattice of Light encompasses the world. Now it must be strengthened. Now it must be more complex as the webbing continues to grow and connect and attach to many others. Now is the time for the world to be cocooned in light and benefit from this blessing.

My beloved friends, see yourselves as active agents of God. See yourselves as the beautiful lights that you are. See yourself as participating in the Divine plan and are truly a part of it. In this way, you will realise consciously the power of your efforts. You will come to know what God has utilised you to do in the world and how many others have benefitted from your efforts. Beautiful souls of light, weavers of light, instruments of light, God’s beautiful channels of light, you are precious. You are loved beyond compare and you are of light. See this, know this, acknowledge it and live your life with this acknowledgement and this knowing so that everything that you do is of light. Every thought that you have is of light. Everything in your life reflects light. For this is God’s desire for you. God will provide you all the ways and means to grow in light, to be a light.

God has a plan for each one of you. God will continue to bless you, uphold you and to enlighten you. You are blessed, beloved souls. You are loved and cherished. Crowded around you are many angels who are helping to stoke the fires and bring the greater light to the world. May you be blessed in greater abundance with each day that comes and today, you are truly blessed. God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you dearly, my beloved friends. God bless you. God bless you.
