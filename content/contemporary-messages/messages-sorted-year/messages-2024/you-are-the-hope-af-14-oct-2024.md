Beloved souls, it is your teacher Augustine. As you continue to grow in the Father's Love I urge you to be a light in the world. For what does the world need most but light, love and peace? You have found the way to be in the grace of God and being in the grace of God, you are a light. You are expressing love and you bring peace. For these things are required for each of God's instruments to be effective. It is not that you must conjure up these conditions. Rather, you must live them as they are living within you. You must express them as they rise up into your consciousness and are expressed within you. Do not hold back when these beautiful conditions and blessings come. For they are not just for you, beloved souls. They are for the world.  

I urge you to step forth in the world as God's instruments, channels of love and light. We have said this countless times. We have urged you and cajoled you forward in this instrumentality that is so required upon your planet. I repeat this calling of each and every one of you. No matter the condition you are in, no matter the situation that surrounds you in your life, there is always the opportunity to be a loving channel in the world, to reach out to another in love, to allow God to use you. Even when you are quiet but are amongst others God may use you to be a light. When you close yourself off from others, when you remove your expression, your countenance by closing yourself, then you cheat yourself of an opportunity to be a channel for God. God does not judge you for this, nor do we. Yet indeed, our inclination and urgings is to encourage you forward in this way to be a channel of love and to be open as this channel. 

I know the world is filled with hurtful things, conditions and individuals who would lash out at you. This is unfortunately an all too real condition of your place of habitation. Yet you are strong enough, beloved souls. You have the power of God's Love within your soul, flowing and expressing itself, glowing and reaching out to others. It is more powerful than all the darkness in the world. For light shall diminish and dissolve darkness. You are a light. You must become a stronger light with each day as you continue to grow in the Father's Love. Be that light, beloved souls. Have confidence in yourself, your beautiful soul. Have faith in God's bonding with your soul, His Love flowing forth. Be sure that God will use you in any given situation to be a light. God will not waste any opportunity to use His instruments in the world. 

It is only you that restricts the flow, my beloved and beautiful friends. It is only you with your reluctance and possibly fear that holds back from others. Yet, you have the most powerful change agent within you that the universe knows. In this, it will change you, this Love of God. It will transform you and make you into a viable, powerful, beautiful and effective instrument of light. As you go forth in the world as a light, you are challenging the darkness. In challenging the darkness, you become the instrument of light that shall disperse it. 

Be warriors of truth. Be warriors of love. Be warriors against the darkness. In this attitude and stance God will use you in many ways, ways that will surprise you, ways that will delight you, ways that will astound you. God ever waits for those opportunities. We wait for those opportunities to be God's intermediaries, those channels that will help to uplift and uphold you as a channel on the Earth. How precious you are, my beloved friends, to be those channels, those beautiful lights on the Earth. You are needed greatly, profoundly needed. It is for you to take up the calling, to act in ways and means that are in harmony with your being, your will and your gifts. These things will be accomplished and expressed in accordance with your desire to do so. 

You will find your way, beloved souls, upon the path of service so crucial at this time in your world. We continue to prepare you for more difficult times ahead. You, in your own way, must seek out your Heavenly Father, must seek out your angel friends and be in alignment with all that is of love, light, goodness and truth. For you are needed and will be greatly needed in the future. Seek to be used as a channel. Pray for this. Practice this. Set out into the world with the intention of being a channel of love and see what might unfold in your day. May you be blessed, beloved students. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you dearly. You are the hope of the world, beloved souls, the hope of the world. God bless you. God bless you all.
