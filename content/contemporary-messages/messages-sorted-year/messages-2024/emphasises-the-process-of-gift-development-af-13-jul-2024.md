I am Seretta Kem and I come again to congratulate you and to reinforce this message that, indeed, it is a process. It continues and shall continue until that time comes when you are confident and open to your gifts and those gifts are manifest in the beautiful ways that God has intended.

My beloved friends, be joyful with your own personal progress in life. For how would your life be without this gift from God? How would your life be without the gift of this fellowship and the gift of your soul awakening to its own self? Beloved friends, we continue upon the road and we shall do so now until the time  comes when you are to transition to the spirit world. We will be with you always and we will continue to open many gifts within you. This is what you have chosen and this is what we are very happy to be a part of. Godâ€™s plan continues to unfold through you.

Indeed the blessings continue to flow. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem and I am happy to see your involvement, commitment and enthusiasm. That will go far as you continue to progress along the road of development and attainment of gifts. God bless you. My love is with you all. I am Seretta Kem. God bless you.
