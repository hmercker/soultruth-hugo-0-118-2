Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

 ____great Soul be yours. I am your friend, Seretta Kem. You have had a discussion about mediumship, some of the technical aspects of it, some of the pitfalls of it. Why would you want to engage in this gift? What is it that draws you into this arena? Is it because you wish to have recognition? Or is it because you wish to serve? Is it because in your mind the idea of mediumship is a beautiful gift and way of being in the world? Your human perceptions. There are many reasons you wish to open this gift. It is certainly intriguing and not a common expression of an individual living on this earthly plane. Yet, we have called you together, each one, not by happenstance but because there is purpose and there is a plan.

I wish to reassure you, my beloved and beautiful friends, that each of you is here for a reason and you will find that reason as you progress along this small time, this short time together and you will be joyful with the outcomes. Yes, there are pitfalls to mediumship, but there are pitfalls to everything you might do in this world. For often the world conspires to bring you to a place of failure rather than success. Dark forces would be very pleased to see you capitulate in your efforts and to have the attitude that you cannot, you are not capable of fulfilling this task. Yet, we have called you together because we need you. We need you to be in alignment with the work that we do and at times that alignment will include mediumship, speaking through you, inspiring you, guiding you, guiding others through you. Whatever assistance can be given we are all too eager to give but we have a limited opportunity to do this sort of direct guidance with others. Yet, you are willing and you seek to serve and you do so in love and with the highest of intentions. So here we are together, beloved souls. Together we are creating something magnificent. We’re opening doors and avenues of communication that will put you in good stead in the future, will assist you in your work as God’s instruments in the world and I know you see this for yourself, possibly in a limited way, but still you are aware of the potentials and the possibilities. These things have not frightened you. Rather they encourage you.

We have been working with you for a long time, each of you for a number of years seeking to guide you along the path that has led you here, seeking to guide you along the path that has led you to God and led you to your own soul. We will continue to uphold you, beloved souls. Now that education has begun. Now you have been tested, often tested many times. You see that the path is not readily travelled. Yet, with the power of God’s love within your souls, you have the confidence and the desire to walk this path of service and to find out for yourself the unique gifts that you carry and how they will be expressed.

My beloved and beautiful friends, this is only the beginning of a magnificent journey. You will find yourselves awakening, opening, developing and growing in love. May you be blessed, my beloved friends, as you take this journey, as we take this journey together. We are close and we shall be for all the duration of your time together. There will not be a moment when an angel is not by your side and you will indeed benefit from the support, light and love. We have put much effort into making it possible for you to be here and for us to be here. God has blessed all of this in the wondrous ways of God’s blessings and the wondrous power of His Love.

It all comes on the heels of your desire, as a result of your efforts, as a light that grows within you that manifests in many different ways, the blessings and expressions that come from your soul. Those gifts, beautiful and magnificent, are given by God as He urges you to discover and to be awakened to all of these things. All of these things God gives you in abundance, in love, in the graciousness of His Being, in the compassion He has for you and for all of humanity. God wants you to know the magnificence of creation and the depth and breadth of His Love for you, the magnificence of your own being. You shall discover these things as you travel the road of soul awakening and transformation. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. I love you dearly, beloved souls, truly and dearly, my friends, my brothers, my sisters. God bless you.
