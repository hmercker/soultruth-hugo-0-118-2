# You Determine the Speed of Your Own Soul Progression 

February 28<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Kona Retreat, HI, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike 



I am James. The strength of your desire will determine your progress, beloved souls. Do you have a deep and abiding longing within your soul to receive the great gift of God’s Love? Or, is your desire in prayer somewhat mediocre and bland, reflecting a commitment that is also mediocre? I know there are times when you are tired and that you do not have the strength and focus to truly pray well. But the power of your prayer, the effectiveness of your prayers are determined by your own condition and by the focus upon your mind and your soul in prayer. 

The alignment of your mind and your soul seeking the great gift from God is what is needed, and the intensity and finesse of this alignment goes a long way to determine the depth and breadth of the blessing that God will give to you. These laws you know well. These laws are important and you must abide by them if you are to have success. We will not judge you if you do not abide by these laws. Yet the judgment comes in the way of lack of response, lack of feeling, lack of upliftment, feeling somewhat deflated in your prayers. 
This happens to every mortal at times. It is not that you are intentionally trying to disrupt or to take away from your efforts. As your day progresses and there are many activities and experiences during your day, it is often difficult to focus upon prayer. This is understandable. God does not judge you. We do not judge you. Yet if you have expectations of deep and wondrous prayers together in this beautiful room of light, this beautiful Portal of Light, and these beautiful souls of light, then the focus must be there, the dedication, the faith, the desire.

There is so much that God wishes to give each one of you. Indeed, that blessing may be powerful and impactful upon you. But the stars must be in alignment, as you would say. All must be in harmony. All is a reflection of your deep soul longing expressed outward to God. You understand prayer well, each one of you. You have prayed many, many times.  At times there has been a great blessing, a great shift, a great inflowing of God’s Love into your souls. The other times you feel very little. Are you within your soul, in alignment and attunement of your soul? Or are you merely within your mind and experiencing things from your five senses? There is certainly a combination of both of these perspectives and conditions. 

Our desire is for you to be fully within your soul. In this way, the wonderment of God’s Touch will be strong and beautiful, amazing in scope. It is for you to find that place. The more often you find that place of true soul alignment with God, then you will have a life and a spiritual life that is truly remarkable and wonderful. Your soul will grow rapidly in this. Your mind will be absorbed by this rapid growth, this mindful growth of the soul that will reflect and respond to God’s Touch upon you and within you.

The inconsistencies are typical of your world, up and down, up and down, deep and shallow. All of these things truly are of the human condition. So you must make greater effort, my beloved friends. You must go with God, be with God, truly. Allow His great blessings to flow upon you, within you, that you may be conscious of these things so that you may be joyful within these experiences. That you may truly know and understand the Will of God, the presence of God, the Love of God. These things are for you. They are your birthright, beloveds. Grasp your birthright. Grasp of what is given and do so like a man in the desert thirsting for water. So it is, your soul’s thirst for the Waters, the Living Waters of God’s Love. Drink deep. Quench your thirst. For that thirst will come again and again and you will feel its longing, its presence within your consciousness.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, deeply, truly. May you find the joy in this blessing. May you come to experience in many ways, many levels and aspects of your perceptions. This blessing given to you in all its abundance, clarity, power, beauty and light. All is for you, beloveds, truly, for you to experience, to know and to receive. May you be blessed, my friends. I am James. I love you. I am close. I love you and I want you to know, truly know, the depth and breadth of God’s Love for you and our love for you, and all the love that is arrayed around you in this beautiful place, this sanctuary of love. God bless you. God bless you all. My love is with you, always. God bless you.
