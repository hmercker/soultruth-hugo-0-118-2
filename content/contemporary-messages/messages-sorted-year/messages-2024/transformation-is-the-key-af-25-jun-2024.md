Transformation is the key to this gathering, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. Each of you has been chosen to come to this circle because you are poised to have within you some aspect that is a reflection of your soul in the process of transformation. For many of you have aspired and desired to receive the great gift of Divine Love,yet, it takes much on our part and God’s blessings to come to that point where transformation is possible. My beloved and beautiful friends, you are ready. Even though some of you have only been praying for this gift for a short while. You are ready for the transformation to take place, a shift of consciousness, an awakening of soul. Thus, you are part of a unique and powerful group of souls. Each of you in your gifts and abilities shall be engaged in assisting your brothers and sisters in this process. Each of you has something to contribute. Each of you shall benefit from the others. 

Think of yourselves in this great crucible of energy, of the flow and blessings of God,  God’s great Soul and His Will manifesting within you. You have come together for a very powerful purpose. We are delighted and joyful that you have accepted the invitation, that you have come together willingly and eagerly in order to partake of the blessings that are intended for each one. You are all equals together and our desire is that there will be unity, a singleness of purpose and will so that indeed as we utilise each one of you, your gifts and your talents for the benefit of the others, that you will not hold back but truly feel and know yourself a part of the whole.

My beloved and beautiful sojourners of light, truth and love, we embark upon a journey like none other and the chemistry, the makeup of this group is unique, like it is with any other group. Yet, this group, this gathering of souls has very great potential indeed to foster and to become a part of the transformation that must happen in order for you to be God’s instruments in the world. Everything in your life to this point has led to this time. Be poised for the great redemptive power of God’s Touch to be upon you. Be poised for what this will do to you and within you. Be poised because great change is coming into your consciousness. In this way, all motivations, desires and perspectives will change in tandem with your soul engaged in this transformation caused by the blessings of God’s Love.

You are truly blessed, my beloved souls, more blessed than many on this Earth, greatly blessed, deeply blessed, profoundly blessed. Be with God and open yourselves fully and all else will fall into place, will flow in accordance to God’s Will and will be in harmony with all that is meant, all that shall be and all that is in harmony with God’s plan for not only your salvation, but the salvation of humanity. Thank you for coming, beloved souls. Thank you for participating. Thank you for loving and being a light. You are truly loved and you shall know this love that shall uplift you and carry you not only for all the days of your life but for all eternity. You will be carried in love, upheld in love and awakened by the Love of God. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem and I love you, my beautiful, beautiful friends. God bless you.
