# Spiritual Detente, Sanctuary, and Personal Responsibility

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

It is I, Care. I come in God’s love to this circle of beautiful souls. Souls who truly aspire to receive the love of God and be changed, despite any differences within such a diverse community. 

So, first and foremost, each one must consider from their heart a form of forgiveness, that one could call *“spiritual détente”*, which is an easing of intolerance, an easing of judgement, an easing of unhealthy skepticism, back-biting, and so forth. When we seek out each one’s gifts, when we honor them and encourage them, it brings so much joy, and I would even say courage, to that soul who may have been battered by life, who may be very reluctant to step forth in fear of judgement, for it is difficult to know another’s path as one must walk their own. 

And yet how important it is to be tolerant, to seek similarity, for are you not all one in this prayer? No matter where you are on earth, and those here in spirit with us, no matter what your culture, your politics, your ethnicity, in God’s love, you come together. A church without walls as we used to say. These circles at present, are your sanctuary, your place of refuge, and when you establish a physical place to be together, when you create a sanctuary, a space to be in prayer, we ask you to keep that sacred, that the love of God may permeate not only your being but be present in that place. That will be a portal of light. 

In the meantime, I would recommend you find a place in nature, or a quiet place that does not have other uses, (laughs to self) and yet my beloved has just reminded me times when I would pray with someone on the street or in the grocery store which seems a bit removed from the cathedrals of nature. However when you are walking in grace, when your whole being feels the glorious light and love of our Creator, you become, in a sense, a walking church and you take your sanctuary wherever you go. For some, this is a way off, for others, it is becoming or is already a part of your reality, and this group, on the forefront of transformation, can well understand me. 
  
In my life on earth, my barometer was often the happiness in my soul and when it was disturbed or when I would, as you might say *‘lose it’*, I knew what needed to be done. And I went through many a dark night of my soul, many a challenge, and so have you all. It is important to remember at that point to pray, to ask God to bring His love into your soul, to feel that presence and that peace. There have been many words spoken so that you may understand the simple truths of prayer and receiving the great gift of the love of God. Each one must take on the responsibility of their relationship with our loving Creator. 

For God is your guru. There are many teachers on earth, there are many channels, but when all is said and done, each soul must reach out, reach up, be free, and with all their heart and the longings in their souls, open to the love of God. With deep love and affection for all here and gratefulness to my beloved for taking this message, I thank you all. May God bless all in this beautiful circle, so many in attendance that you cannot see, but perhaps you can feel us, in this circle of light, on the bridge to the celestial heavens. We are your eternal friends in God’s love. I thank you. I am your sister in Christ, I am Care. Go in peace.
