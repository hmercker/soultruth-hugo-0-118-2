# Founder of Zoroastrianism Religion affirms the Divine Love Pathway to Atonement with God

July 30<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike 

My name is Zoroaster. I am the founder of the sect of this name. I want to assure you that you are on the right path, that you will find great light and great fulfillment by connecting and being with God in the way that you do. I did not know this way when I walked the Earth and taught my lessons of truth. But I know now the power of this Love, this Essence of God, and how it may, indeed, transform every soul and bring each one into alignment with the great Creator of all things. This Love is infinite. It is powerful and it is transformative. 

I come to affirm this truth and to tell you that you are, indeed, upon a path like none other, a path that will bring you to the highest and greatest truth of all. I support you on this journey. I continue to learn myself of these things as I take this journey forward and become an acolyte of your beloved master, Jesus, who brought this truth to humanity. One teacher may learn from another and one truth may be higher than another, but indeed, we all strive toward greater truth. We all seek that which is of God. So, we shall join together one day in the onement of all truth and in the onement with God in love, harmony and peace. 

May the truth reign supreme within you. May the power of love be the marker of this truth. Be the great flame that is the light of this truth. May you know the peace that comes with God close and true in your lives. I am Zoroaster and I love you, each one. For when one loves God, one loves all who are God’s creation. So, we are brothers and sisters in the truth of love, in the glory of God’s Love. I thank you. I thank you all. 

## Debrief by Al:##

After the closing prayer, Al described his personal experience:

He shared Zoroaster first introduced himself to Al while in prayer with a group of Iranian friends living in Los Angeles almost 5 years ago. Zoroaster came to him again today like twirling fireworks spinning around quickly, spraying out all kinds of sparks!  So I recognized him right away – with sparks just flying off him!  

Zoroaster is a very energetic soul, a powerful healer. He gave me healing with his beautiful light. He was wearing a dark purple robe with gold embroidery on the edges of his sleeves and down the front and around the bottom. He wore a kind of a tall hat with gold embroidery on it. There was some kind of message in the embroidery. But, of course, I cannot read that language.  He was swarthy looking, with a dark beard.  A beard like mine, except black and longer. His eyes were dark and he had dark eyebrows, with a very intense look. A beautiful spirit and it’s wonderful he is on the Divine Path, affirms our path to Atonement with God – so wonderful to hear. Wonderful.
