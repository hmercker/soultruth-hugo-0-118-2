Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

(I am Mary.) Each one of you has one Celestial Angel guide who walks with you and will continue to walk with you as you progress throughout your time upon the Earth plane. This is a gift, a gift from our Heavenly Father to help you through your struggles. For your Earth life is a challenge but know that you have the gift of Divine Love within your souls. You have the gift of a Celestial Angel to help you, to guide you, to walk with you. You have the gift of your Heavenly Father’s care, and he is solicitous of your needs and your desires.

Although you have challenges, you have gifts that will help you to move forward in your progression. You will always have all that you need and more. You only need to ask and open to receive the Father’s blessings upon your souls. Always seek the Father in each step that you take and you will have all that you need and more. May God bless you. May your souls always be open and my gift of love to you is offered. I am your sister, Mary. I live very high in the Celestial Heavens, and it is my privilege to come speak to you children. My love is with you. God bless you.
