May the blessings of the Father's Love touch you deeply, infilling your souls, expanding your souls in this holy Essence of God. I am Barbara. I come to speak to you about loving yourselves. This was not my strong point. I did not love myself the way I should have while I walked the Earth. Now that I am in the Celestial Kingdom, I truly understand what love is. Indeed, as you know love, experience love and express love, it cannot help but be truly a part of you and a sense you have of yourself, how beautiful, how wonderful you are. God's creation. God's child. You become a light in God's universe.

 I urge each one of you, to acknowledge the efforts that you have made to become a beautiful channel of love in the world, but also a beautiful channel of love for yourself. Because it is important that love permeates everything and all that you are. For how can you be a pure and true instrument of God if you do not love yourself, love the world and love God? In the power of love, in the beauty of love that builds within you, so that channel becomes strong and pure. So you are a changed soul, transformed by the love. In this transformation, you become clear in your light, wise and loving in your demeanour.

I was a channel of light in the world, a channel of love. I followed my guidance daily and I trusted in my guidance. I trusted in God and I moved in very dark places in the world. Being an instrument of light there, I did not feel in danger. I merely trusted and had great faith in God's guidance for me. I moved in the world in various places, cultures and conditions that allowed me to be that channel of love. It was humble and quiet. I do not beat my own drum, but others saw how I worked and how I was in the world and they acknowledged me. I received some awards and some public recognition for my work, but that was not my goal as these things meant little to me.

Yet, I continued to serve the best that I could, for as long as I could. I served until I was in my 70s. I served for many years to help the downtrodden, the homeless, the hungry, the lost and those who were deeply disturbed, and God did protect me. God kept His light of protection around me. I prayed for this daily, as I prayed for my guidance, as I prayed for my soul to continue to expand in His Love. When I lost my sentience, my mind if you will,the Love of God took over my demeanour. This is where I found how to love myself, for all those patterns of the mind that continued to refute love were gone. I did not know them or feel them, for my mind was deteriorating in such a way that I was free from these conditions.

I would not suggest this is a route to go for any of you, but it was the circumstances of my later life. Yet, what persisted, what continued to thrive within me, was the Love within my soul. It was the consciousness of my soul that continued to work, grow and be expressed. Though my memory was gone, my consciousness of the moment was very much present. So, when I was with others, I felt great love for them and compassion. My perceptions continued to help me to see things that many could not see, to perceive individuals in a way that was real perception, rather than the mask and the persona that people would don in order to be accepted in life. I could see them for who they are and I could love them for who they are.

This is important, beloved souls, to see and love all who you meet for who they are. For God created them unique. Indeed, many are damaged and distorted because of the way of the world, but deep within them is their true self. Look at that place within them. Look at who they are in their souls. Look at how God would look at them in loving compassion and appreciation of their beings. This is bringing love to the world. It does not require deep intellect. In fact, it requires very little mind. What it requires is great soul and the exercise of the soul in all its faculties and beauty.

Yes, the mind is a helpful thing. Indeed, I needed others to help me navigate life when my mind was not functioning properly. None of you are in that situation, but I say to you that if you can put aside your judgements, your fears, all those things that come with the mind and the old patterns that have been developed over the years, then you will be free. You will know the presence of God and you will know the feeling of joy that comes when you feel His Love, when you know it with every breath, when it is real within you and is a powerful presence with you. That way, anything that God asks of you, you have the strength, the wisdom and the ability to follow through with the guidance given.

So, my beautiful friends, be within your soul. Yes, your mind is present and, indeed, you can always appreciate the faculties of your mind that help you navigate the world. Don't let those dark emotions, feelings and judgements cloud your purpose and the expression of love through you. Be free in the purity of light and love and God will reinforce this condition over and over again as you continue to pray and seek out God with every breath so, with every breath, God is with you. Be true to yourself. Be true to what God has created, a soul that is magnificent. Be loving in all circumstances, especially toward yourself.

May God's Love continue to burn away and disperse anything and all aspects of you that are not of love, and not in harmony with God's Laws of Love. You will find the reward that you seek, the blessings that will come and the joy that must come with the Touch of God. I am Barbara and I love you all, beloved souls. I love you all. Beautiful lights in the world. Continue to shine and continue to grow in love. God bless you. God bless you all.
