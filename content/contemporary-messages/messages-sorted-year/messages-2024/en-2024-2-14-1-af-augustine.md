# Guidance for Each DL Mediumship Participant to Examine Their Motivation

February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

I am your teacher, Augustine. We are very pleased that a number of individuals are willing to take the time and effort to gather in your mediumship circle. It is important to set the standards and the conditions, the time and the place in order for all of us to collaborate together in making this precious time effective and blessed.

Many who are coming have, indeed, an innate gift for mediumship, but that gift will not be opened by us if their commitment is weak, and their desires are of the mind rather than the soul to serve. It is important for everyone to ask themselves *“what is my motivation? Why am I coming to join in this purposeful gathering?”* It would be easy for us to open each individual so that their gifts may shine and that we may use them as spokespersons for the Truth of God’s Love.

This is not a difficult matter, nor is it complicated. What makes it complicated are the motivations and inner workings of the individual in question. They must be clear as to their motivations and desires. For we do not enter this collaboration lightly. We do not expect the individual to be casual in their commitment either. Because this is and will become a way of life rather than some hobby or idea of service that is expressed on occasion but does not reflect their daily commitment.

Many are unclear as to what the gift of mediumship entails. This is where you, my beloved and beautiful students, must bring that clarity to them and teach them. For there are two here who are well-versed in the experience. All of you know the Truth of God’s Love and how this is the very foundation of this development and expression of gifts. This will not be difficult for you, beloved students. You have entered this circle of development and teaching often and know well the process, the way in which it flows and becomes a solid and tangible process of awakening particular gifts. For us it is an easy and simple process. We have, in our group, our band, many who are eager and are well able to assist in the development process. All is in alignment in this regard. Technically there are no great issues or hurdles to overcome.

As always, dealing with mortals, it is the intransigence of the mind, the confusions and duality of thought, ideas, commitment and emotions, many aspects of being human that often pose great barriers to a clear and effective opening of the gift of mediumship. It is important, as with any such gathering when it is as purposeful as this is, that everyone prepares themselves, that they enter into prayer asking God to help develop their gifts, asking God to show them the way for that development and for them to deeply understand the extent of the commitment that is involved.

Each gift has a price and this is well known, not only with Divine Love mediumship, but with all mediumships, that the price one pays for this opening is increased sensitivity. With it must come increased vigilance, not only in thought but action. It is important that one does not enter a dark and negative condition without being guided and with the intention to purify. It is important to honour the gift that God has given you with integrity and a desire to serve and to bring through the highest of teachings and blessings.

What we see as a great advantage of mediums coming to the fore is that in their own respective Circles of Light, the gift of mediumship can be used to help bolster and uphold those who are a part of that circle. This adds another solid link to the efforts made. It is not a necessary aspect of such circles, but we have found over the years that those with the gift of mediumship tend to help cement the commitment of those within the circle. The downfall of some circles is that they become more concerned, and their intentions are more focused upon the message received rather than opening their souls to the great gift of God’s Love.

Indeed, when there is a balance between these two things harmony ensues. Yet, when many come to a circle to experience and be a part of an expression of mediumship as their primary focus and desire, the true purpose of this opening and gift is lost. Each who is coming, beautiful souls each one, must question within themselves their motivations, must be introspective and seek out what the true desire within them is to serve. Are they willing to entertain the great shift that will come with the opening of these gifts? Are they willing to put aside material concerns as a great focus in their life? Are they willing to put forward their own spiritual progression and the opening of gifts such as mediumship as a focus in their life? Are these things truly a part of their thinking and motivation, the desire of the soul to step forward and be expressed?

All these things must come into consideration, and all these things are important to consider. Everyone, when they have made the choice and decision to come will have the way open to them and the ways and means to attend provided. God will make many opportunities possible when it is in harmony with His plan and Will for the individual. The individual will sense the rightness of knowing, of being a part of a venture such as this. If they are ambivalent, they must pray more. If they conclude that this is not truly what they wish to do, then it is important for them to state this early on and to not enter into the fray, so to speak.

Yet, if this is meant to be and their souls know this to be true, then there will be joy, enthusiasm and deep desire. They will see for themselves the wonders of God’s Touch upon them and the opening of various gifts given to them. Much will come of this gathering. Changes and shifts will come to each one, even those who are facilitators. For in a gathering such as this, does not God use every opportunity and ways and means for further soul growth and development? It will be for each one. All will benefit. All will be blessed.

My beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, continue to seek for the highest, to seek ways and means of serving God and serving your brothers and sisters. As you do so, the opportunities will arise for further awakening and development. You will find your way and it is a glorious path, is it not? One full of adventures, surprises, deep and beautiful blessings. So, it shall be for the road less travelled and walk with God in the light of His loving care, ministrations and blessings.

God bless you, I am Augustine, your teacher, one who loves you so. My commitment is forever as you walk this path. I shall always be there by your side. God bless you. I love each one of you. God bless you.
