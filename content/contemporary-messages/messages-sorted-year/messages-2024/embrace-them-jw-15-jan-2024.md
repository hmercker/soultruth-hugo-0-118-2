# Embrace them as God has embraced you

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your sister in Christ, Care. If you were to pass over in this moment into spirit, where would you wish to be? In whose company would you be drawn to? What atmosphere would you wish to live in? 
   
For those who have spent a lifetime pursuing material needs beyond the necessary, they often find spiritual bankruptcy is their situation here in spirit. And you may have observed in your interactions with those who have great wealth, perhaps great power, many possessions, that their energies are so focused on obtaining and possessing things of the earth, that they are not possessors of any real happiness, and often, their enjoyment of material things is a shallow kind of pleasure. 

My dear brothers and sisters, you who have felt the riches of spirit in the receiving of God’s love, you have amassed a treasure in spirit that will not only bring you joy while on earth, but bring you the true riches, the true joy in spirit. I shall never wish to chastise anyone for their material possessions, for so many are kind and share what they have and of course the bare necessities of life need to be provided for while on earth. 
   
Our brother Francis often talks about the poverty of material wealth and the richness of spiritual life in God’s grace. So I wanted to encourage you to reflect on your own happiness. What has truly brought you joy? What has truly brought balm to your afflictions, lifted you up, what company has allowed you to stand naked before your Creator without shame, only asking for the deep blessing of His love? 
    
What a blessing it is to be amongst friends in this circle, to know that you have a family in Divine Love, ever expanding on this earth and in the heavens. Those of you who are close to your loved ones, to your families, who may not seem interested in this path, I will posit to you, that in their time of need, they shall seek out your company as you seek out each other’s to be in concordance in prayer for the love of God. 

Oh, how blessed we are. So, let us be mindful of our loved ones, whether they be on earth or in spirit and send them love in the name of God. Help them to be open to the great gift. Embrace them as God has embraced you beyond time, for all eternity, in the never-ending journey in God’s love that we all share. Be of good cheer and celebrate each life, each precious soul as you walk in faith and in His love. 
   
Lastly, in case anyone has forgotten, when you ask, we come. For we are here at your service. And above all things, on this earth where you live, and in the heavens, when you ask for the love of God with an open heart and all the longings in your souls, you shall always receive. So give your minds a rest if even for a few moments. Allow those troubles to be healed and dissolved in this circle of light, in this circle of love, in this company. May all your dreams come true in the love of God. I thank you. I am your sister and friend, in the celestial heavens, a follower of the Master, and one who is blessed beyond words. Go in peace. I am Care.
