# Touch Their Souls with That Sacred Gift That You Have

April 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am with you now, sister. I am your beloved brother, John and I ask you to be patient as we grow stronger in our rapport. Truth is a valuable commodity, especially on the Earth plane. You, dear children, carry within you the truth of our Father’s love as well as other truths. You will soon see the opportunity to share these truths with those of your brothers and sisters who are unaware and some who are unwilling to participate in receiving these truths of God.

You need not fret about those choose to keep walking past you beyond the sound of your voice, but not beyond the love that you carry and share with them. Remember, words are symbolic for feelings. So, touch their souls even if they close their ears. Touch their souls with that sacred gift that you have within you that the Father has placed there within you and wish them well along their way and pray for them that they will come to recognize the gift that you have expressed to their souls. One day, perhaps in a very long time, they will come to you and thank you and even bless you for saving their lives because that is what each one of you will be doing to those to whom you give your love. You will be saving their lives regardless of the words you use. Take this with you, dear children, take this with you, pray upon it and you will find you will know exactly what to do and with whom.

I see you going out, many of you, some of you in the spirit world will also be going out to teach. The gate is open. God bless you and we of course will be with you, helping you, guiding you, showing you. We are doing the Father’s will. All will unfold in accordance with His will. May God bless you. May God pour His love into your souls, and may your souls open wide and open deeply and may you feel the presence of this love within your souls, to carry you forward, to bring you higher and higher and higher places more filled with light and love than you can imagine. May God bless you. My love is with you as is the love of all of my brothers and sisters who are here today from the Celestial Heavens and even from far off planets and of course, our Father’s love. God bless you. I am John, John the Baptist and my love is with you. Let us pray together.
