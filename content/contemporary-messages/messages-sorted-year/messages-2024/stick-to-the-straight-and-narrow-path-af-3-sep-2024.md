# Stick to the Straight and Narrow Path – the Simple Truth of God’s Divine Love

The beautiful Breath of God is upon you, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I come to encourage you upon the path as I have done many times before, to help you keep upon the straight and narrow, the Path Divine leading to at-onement with God. It is such a very simple path. Yet, within your minds, often you tend to adorn this path with various ideas and various thoughts that you have gained from others and that you create within yourself. Rather than go to God in this simple way, you place before yourselves various conditions, parameters and concepts that somewhat complicate this journey. This is because your mind is so very active. Your mind continues to control your actions. Although in conjunction with your mind is the soul, that is also involved in your relationship with God. Together you must find that balance between the two and find yourself upon the road that is clear and simple.

Do not overcomplicate your journey, beloved souls. For you need not have these complications. You already know the blessings and the inflowing of God’s Love through the longings of your soul. This is what is required and yes, you may ask in words what it is that you desire from God. This is second nature to you. It is part of your earthly conditions. When your soul has been transformed by the blessings of God’s Love, those words will not be necessary. For you will have a direct communication with God that is so finely intuitive and attuned to God that the words will seem inadequate and the feelings will be great, blossoming forth from your soul. 

Until that time it is often necessary for you to place your prayers in verbal dialogue so that you are satisfied that your communications and your intentions are being conveyed. Yet in many ways those communications and intentions are already conveyed by the soul. You are merely reciting a dim reflection of these things within your mind in order to satisfy your desire to be heard and to be known by God. Yet God hears and knows you much more than you know yourself. God is there, for you have ensured this by receiving the great gift of His Essence within your soul, opening the way for this communication that is of soul. Often you will be reciting a prayer within your soul and your mind is not even aware of it. You will be seeking guidance from God and your mind cannot accept it. You will be acting as God’s channels and yet, your mind does not see what it is that you do. How you are in the world is a very different thing than what has been expressed from your and through your soul to another, to the world. 

Be heartened by the fact that your soul is an active agent for God. That it often does not require your focus, your mindful understanding of what is happening. Rather it is allowing the desires of the soul, uninhibited by the mind, to be expressed and the actions of the soul clearly flowing through you into the world. That light that you carry, informing what it is that you are to do and how you are to be. It is unfortunate that you must carry this duality of consciousness with you. It is the way of your world and in time, that way will vanish. 

You will be integrated within yourself, mind and soul. One consciousness rather than two. It is coming and I urge you to continue to pray and uphold your efforts, my beloved friends. Be true to your soul. Be true to yourself and all the beauty and glory of your soul will find its mark upon this world and be expressed with such eloquence and grace within you and through you. This is the Touch of the Father’s Love activating, transforming and blessing you, beloved souls. So you will continue upon the path. Accept and express what it is that is happening within you, the power and glory of your soul becoming at-one with God. 

God bless you, my beloved and beautiful students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am with you often, as you know. I love you dearly, as you must know. For I have dedicated so much of myself and my efforts on your behalf in teaching, uplifting and guiding. It is yours out of love, my friends. It is yours because I love. It is yours because God uses me as His instrument and I willingly participate, the consciousness of soul active and alive within me. God bless you, beloved and beautiful students. God bless you in love. Augustine loves you. God bless you.
