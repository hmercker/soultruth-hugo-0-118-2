# God’s Love Will Bring the Changes Needed in the World

Francis of Assisi received by Al Fike

Thank you for calling me. I am Francis and I am happy to come to you today and speak of the Truth of Love. As you all know, seeking the highest gift of Love, the Essence of God, asking for it to enter into your soul and changing you with its presence and effects, is the beginning of the changes that must come to your world. For you begin the change by being the change, by being the light and the truth. For when you learn to love all of God’s creation as I did, you cannot help but be that agent of change. You cannot help but love everything in the world. To feel the expansiveness of that love touching everything that you encounter in your life, is being the agent for God to bring change.

Focus on that love. Focus on your soul expanding and expressing that love. Focus on how your feelings rise up from deep within, filled with compassion, filled with insight, filled with love for everything, seeing the world from the eyes of the soul, knowing the world from the presence and gifts that God gives you in His Love, a true channel of love in the world. The world cannot heal from mindful efforts, although there are certainly benefits. The world can truly heal from the power of love expressed within you and through you and expressed through many others.

In this way, light touches everything. In this way, there is peace and there is a reverence for all of God’s creation. This reverence must be in your consciousness as you continue to look at the world around you and feel compassion, love, appreciation and respect for all of God’s creation. In this way, you can only be an agent of change. That change will affect everything within you, will affect your desires, your priorities and how you engage in the world.

I gave up everything to be in harmony with God. Though God does not expect you to do as I did, in truth, if you are to be in harmony with His Laws of Creation and Laws of Love, then you must give up those things that are not in harmony. Be the truth, a living example, a beautiful light, and God will work through you many things, many blessings and miracles that will touch others deeply and will help to bring the change that is required in your world. This change does not have to be severe and difficult. It could be easy and harmonious if the world only adopted love rather than fear, ignorance and darkness.

Be love, my beloveds. Be truth and be a light reflecting the power of God’s Love within you. In this, you will draw your angel friends close, and we will walk together, a powerful force to bring harmony back to the world. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Francis and I love you. God bless you.
