# You Are Reaching Souls Not Minds

September 16<sup>th</sup>, 2024

On the Road, Wytheville, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike 

Beloved Souls, it has purpose and I encourage you to make efforts to connect with each soul that is upon your path even though there may be resistance. Often the mind and the soul disagree. The soul is yearning for these connections but the mind may be reluctant. It is with love that you overcome the reluctance of the mind and encourage the desire of the soul to be embraced, to pray, to receive. So I encourage you to reach out to your dear friend, this precious soul who is in confusion and cannot see clearly at this time truly to see what it is she wants.

As for the others, there is a great variety of ideas and perceptions as to what is truth. It is better that you are subtle and quiet with your communications rather than bombastic and insistent on what the truth is. Again, you are reaching souls, not minds and that is where the work is. That is where the focus is. Your friends will gather with you and pray with you even though they are unsure as to what they are doing. They will feel drawn and open. Thus, your role will be complete and fulfilled. Each time you stop and connect and pray with others, it will be unique and different. You had a very fulfilling and uplifting time with your fellow Divine Love followers and this is nourishing to everyone. 

There will be times when you feel somewhat disconnected because the individuals who you are praying with are not attuned to what it is you are seeking and receiving but you are there nonetheless to plant the seeds, to be the channels of light, to bring the truth in whatever way is possible. We will guide you, beloved souls, with each step, with each prayer, with each time you are gathered together. Remember, it will be unique and it will not necessarily feel familiar to you. But this is how you are being prepared to be open to different conditions and different individuals who require a different approach.

Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the world were all receptive to praying for Divine Love. It would change the world. All those individuals seeking out the Heavenly Father, receiving the great gift that He has to give to the soul. But first, the inroads into the mind must be accomplished to teach in a way that others are receptive, to not do so with the error of superiority but do so with humility, grace and understanding. For you were all there at one time. That ignorance of the truth lived within you and you lived within it. In time, the yearnings of your soul overcame that ignorance and you were able to establish a clear and beautiful connection with God. 

Thus, God’s Will was satisfied and expressed through you. For God’s Will is always for that deep and personal connection between you and your Creator. When you feel that longing within your soul to answer God’s Will, to be with God in this way, then there is joy, upliftment, fulfillment. You must teach this to others. Coax them along the path, a path that many are reluctant to take, a path that is not usual, a path that contradicts the mind, but indeed satisfies the soul.

You are being challenged at times, in this way, to teach in the way that others may understand but you must learn and experience these conditions in order to come to that place of wisdom, of humility and grace, that will reach many souls. Even though, in their minds they are resistant but in their souls, they are yearning and desirous of truth and fulfillment.
You will find your way upon this path of learning and expressing as God’s instruments provided the great flow of love is there. Who could resist this? There may be a reaction that brings fear and even negativity. But every soul will feel the power of the love in their own way and will yearn for it. Even though the mind will put up great resistance at some times, the yearning is still there. And you have planted the seeds of giving the simple truth that is required. 

May you be blessed, beloved souls. May you be blessed. I am Orion. I have come to support you and to help you. I am close even though I have not spoken before. I have been close and shall be. I will speak at the gathering that you refer to where there are those who are interested in beings from other worlds. I will speak. God bless you, my friends. Continue in your wonderful work bringing your wonderful light and inviting the world to join you in this light and truth. Blessings to you.

Beloved souls, you travel and you teach. You share and you love. What is different from my day and my ministry and yours is the way you travel and the way that you get there. But the message is still the same. The blessings flow as they did in my day. So you will gather the sheep, you will gather the flock and pray with them and ask God to bless us all. I will be with you, beloveds, I will be with you. God bless you. i am your brother Jesus, and I come to assure you that you are indeed doing the work of the Father and indeed bringing the message as my disciples, indeed as my apostles.

God bless you. I am your brother and friend Jesus and I love you, always. You are precious to me, precious to the world, indeed as a light. God bless you.
