I come too on the heels of our beloved Master’s encouragement, to also encourage you in your efforts. If you know my story, you know that I walked in faith and that I sought to serve God in whatever way I could to help bring light and truth to whoever would listen. I spoke to many. I traveled to many places. God used me in many ways. All of this was accomplished, not because I was a great speaker or had political connections or even spiritual power, it was because I had faith. I asked God to use me as His instrument, and so He did, on many occasions in many ways.

Am I any different from you, my friends? Did I have particular gifts? Yes, but so do you. So do you, beloved souls. Each of you are gifted. Each of you have talents and abilities that rise above the rest. So I say to you, seek out what it is within you that prompts you to serve God. Seek out what it is that God has put within you to bring your talents forward, blessed by the great Love of God shining forth in your souls. 

This Love, the power of this Love and Light within you is great. It will inform everything that you do. It will bring through you wisdom, light, truth and many blessings because you have aligned yourself with the highest Truth of all, the Truth of Divine Love. This is so needed in your world. I had my day and an impact on the minds and souls of many. There are publications and legacies that I left as I transformed into the spiritual life of the spirit world. 

What legacies will you leave behind, beloved souls? What efforts are you making? Are they efforts inspired by God, or are they the efforts inspired by your mind? Think of this. Think of what you can do. Think of what God can do through you. In this way, you will find that happy place where you have satisfied your eager ambitions in alignment with God’s Will. This is so important, to have that balance between your will and God’s Will. To release those things within you that would hold you back and those things within you that would push you forward into ventures that are more of your ego, rather than your soul. 

Be strong in faith. Ask God. Ask God to guide you with each day and you will find that your efforts will build, that the twists and turns of your life will be blessed. Much will be accomplished as you listen to your guidance, as you follow your guidance, as you are exemplary in the flow of God’s Will, God’s desire for what you must do in your life. For God has a plan, beloved friends, a great plan.

You are a part of that plan if you wish to be a part. Think of this, beloved souls, beautiful lights of God. Think of how you might serve. Think of how you might be in the world, to be a healer, a leader, a speaker, a light. These things are possible within each one of you. They can grow and strengthen and be powerful, a powerful influence in the world, as long as God is at the helm and you follow God’s Will.

God bless you, my friends. I am Eileen Caddy and my love is with you. I now reside within the Celestial Kingdom. I did not fully understand the Truth of God’s Love, but in my heart, I knew of it. Now I truly am in alignment and transformed by it, truly. My joy is great. My love for you is great, my love for humanity, all souls who are seeking. May you be blessed, my friends, truly, truly blessed. I love you always.
