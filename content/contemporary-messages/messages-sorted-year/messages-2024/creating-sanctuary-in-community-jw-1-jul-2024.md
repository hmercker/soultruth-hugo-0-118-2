# Creating Sanctuary in Community with Heart

It is I, your brother and friend in the great love of God, Yogananda. 
   
I come this evening to share with you a bit of my experience in forming a community while on earth. For as the events in the world become more polarized, the need for sanctuary, the need for places of refuge, becomes more necessary. When my guru sent me to the United States, I found myself in a situation of being this long-haired Indian, landing as if on another planet amidst the urbanization and modernization in the United States, which I had not seen in India. And so I prayed. And as I prayed, I began to disseminate what I knew as truth, which was a form of Kriya yoga, to calm those in a busy world, so bereft of peace, true peace. 

I began to collect a group of followers and this small group devoted their time to my teaching and of course to God and we sought sanctuary. And I am so grateful that many centers around the world as well as in the United States were formed and created without me having a penny in my pocket, for God could see the need. 

And these centers were maintained and developed by the devotees living there and they attracted those who felt something real was happening, something spiritually magnetic. And so to this day, there are those who visit, there are those who spend time in retreat, there are some who come occasionally, there are those who take classes, and there are those who live there and maintain the atmosphere. 

I had promised my followers that I would come again and again if necessary to earth, for my love for them was beyond words. And as I realized in my progression through spirit that I was not going to incarnate again on earth, I could still keep my promise, by coming to those who were studying my teachings, by coming through this brother and others. The condition of my soul is now one transformed and I encourage you to create a safe haven, sustainable as possible, peaceful, and focused primarily on God’s love. 
     
For those who come into the truths of Divine Love, perhaps through reading a book, hearing a song, being present in the company of a Divine Love medium, or listening to what is received, they are often inspired to be walking anew on this path. And as they engage in prayer and with the community and begin to understand the things that they have read and what has been communicated to them, they hunger deeply to feel the presence and love of God and this, as you have been told countless times, is accomplished through prayer. 

For the deep longings of every soul, every heart, going out to God are responded to with the great gift of His essence, this Divine Love. And for those who are intellectually engaged and have some understanding but do not feel as if they have had this connection, we encourage you to continue from your heart, so that your souls’ may be opened. 

Have faith that the promise of this great gift will change you and once you feel the magnificence of the love of God in your soul lifted above your concerns, once you feel that, you would never wish to return, and of course the journey is progressive. You will fall back sometimes, but you will never lose that love in your souls and that love shall continue to grow as you engage in prayer. 

All of the messages, all of the books, all of the songs, all of the wonderful quotes you have been given, may they inspire your souls to engage in this prayer, that you may be transformed. For the many who have felt the love of God in their being, they know the truth that I speak and for those who have an inkling, who have an understanding that it is real, continue, take heart, for this promise, this gift, is given to all who truly ask, who truly open, who truly engage in faith, in prayer, and in love.
    
I want to thank my brother for allowing me to come tonight. It has been a while, and I am very delighted to always speak through him. I pray that my message resonates with all, and I shall step back in the humbleness of this prayer, asking the Creator to fill us with His love. May God bless each one and may the peace of His love truly be yours. I love you and I am your brother in Christ. I am Yogananda.
