# Using Humour to Expose Greed, Injustice, and Inequality

Charlie Chaplin received by Jimbeau Walsh

This is your friend, Charlie Chaplin. What a blessing to be here in your beautiful Circle, lifted above the world and its weight upon your shoulders. In my time on Earth as a street urchin with my brother, our mother incapacitated, our father gone, we saw much misery, much poverty. Yet, I could see that what needed to be restored was humour.

So, with the guidance of my mother, who was considered mentally ill but was, in fact, a very blessed soul, I slowly but surely began to create situations where humour could expose the comedy of errors present in the world, where humour could expose greed, injustice, and inequality. Though I did not have the Love of God in my soul, I had a lot of heart. So, I injected this into my work and touched millions during a depression, during a war. You know, when I started there were no words. There were just expressions and later on, when the talkies began and words were needed, I used them.

When I entered spirit, my mother became my spiritual guide, and she is an inhabitant of the Celestial Heavens. She introduced me to this Love of God. As I progress through the spheres and get closer to the Celestial Heavens, I am drawn to help those who use the arts to bring this love to the world. I have helped my brother here in his endeavors and many others. For some, the arts are their way, the way in which their souls can be reached, their hearts can be opened. So, no matter how many words come to you, ultimately it is the longings in your souls, the yearnings of every heart for love that make the difference.

As you well know, when this longing includes to be at one with our Creator it brings a real substance into your soul. This substance can never be lost. So, when you wonder what should I do? How can I take this gift and bring it to the world? For all, each one of you has gifts, known and unknown. So, I give you this simple way to deduce and utilize your gifts. It is this; Pray, ask to receive the great gift of God’s Love. When you feel this, and you are motivated to write a poem, a song, do a dance, write a book, bake some bread, or feed the hungry, you can then utilize your gifts with God’s Love. More than that, you cannot do. So, whatever it is, whatever your passion is, allow this gift to be channeled to the love in your souls. For again, I say, it is beyond the words in the activation of your will to receive and to be in God’s Will that makes a difference, as you all know. You all know this in your souls. Should you need help with a project in the arts, call on me and I shall come.

I shall step back now and join you in this beautiful Circle, in the Love of God. I wish you every blessing and give you all my love. I can tell you the love of so many is here with you. I thank you.

I am Charlie Chaplin. May God bless you.
