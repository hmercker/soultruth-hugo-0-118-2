Bright Waters received by Al Fike

As the Great White Spirit touches your souls my name is Bright Waters and you do not know of me, but I know of you. I am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. I have been for a long time now. This dear instrument remarks on the beauty of women. I, too, was beautiful in my day on the Earth, and I am still beautiful. Every child within the Kingdom of Heaven is beautiful, and displays a light and love that is magnetic. It attracts many to us, because we have the Love of God within us.

I come to pray with you and to tell you that each of you may be a beautiful and bright light in the world. When you shine forth, you draw to you many who are eager to partake of this light. They feel deep within them a longing. They sense the attraction of soul to soul. Each of you, do not hold back when you walk in the world, but smile your bright smiles. May your intentions be that of good will for everyone, and when you do this, you are God’s channel of love in the world, love that is so needed in your world, love that is not common in your world, but love that has a special quality. When you upon the earthly plane, express it through your physical bodies, minds and souls expressing this light, it creates and has to it a quality that is tangible, attractive and beautiful.

Jesus walked in the world as that light. He beamed light, love and goodness. As he did so, many were drawn to him. Now it is your turn, beloveds, to be that light, to draw many to you and to tell them of the gift that God has for each one of them. No matter who they are, no matter what condition that they are in, that love from God is for them personally. It is for them. God loves every soul with such magnitude and wonderment, beauty and light that you could not fathom the breadth and depth of His love for every child that He created in the universe.

My beautiful friends, walk in the peace, the glory and the brightness of God’s Love. It is available to you whenever you wish to have it. It does not cease, it is not limited in any way and it is for you. A personal gift from God given in abundance, given because you are loved.

I come to you as a servant of God. I come to you because I wish to serve and bring greater light to the world, greater light to my peoples who are downtrodden and struggle so, and greater light to all the peoples of the world, many of whom do not live a life as abundant as yours. I come with deep concern for those who are impoverished. I come for the children who feel unloved. I come to give love to those who are thirsting for love. I wish that I may partner with you, each one, as a channel to be that loving instrument for God in the world.

So many need you and so many can benefit from your light. Be open to this, my beautiful brothers and sisters. Be open to all that God wishes to give through you. For in this giving, you are upheld and you become more of a light in the world. Every moment, every breath can be an opportunity to serve God in this way, to be His faithful servants, His channels of love. Be true to the Will of God, for within you is the knowledge of this Will. Be true to your own deep desires to drink of the living waters, God’s Love, and you will find that each day will be a blessing and a gift, an opportunity and a journey towards greater service and love.

I love you. My name is Bright Waters. I lived as what you call an indigenous soul on the plains of your continent. I had a good life when I walked the earth. Our peoples were peaceful, and we lived off the land in such a way that our needs were met and all was in harmony with God’s creation. We appreciated everything that was given by the Great White Spirit. We honoured the Creator and loved one another. In times to come, you will all live in a way that is similar to this. Though, of course, change must come, and the world will provide for its peoples. Before this can be, you must be in harmony with all that is of God. You are learning to do so. You are finding your way into greater light. The ancient wisdom will return at some time in the future. You will see with the eyes of the soul the power of that wisdom and the beauty of that wisdom.

May you be blessed my beloved friends and walk upon the path of love. God has lit the way, has he not? God has brought the Truth into your bosom and there it rests for eternity.

My love is with you. God bless you all upon your journey.
