Matthew received by Elizabeth Mack

May the breath of God be upon your souls. I am your brother, Matthew. I come to pray with you, to help uplift you and to bring you closer to the Face of God, that you may learn how beautiful and precious is the Father’s Love for each of His children, His Soul yearning for each of yours to be embraced by His.

I am a follower of my Master, Jesus. We who are here have felt your sincere desires to be closer to the Father and those desires bring us here to assist you. We are always ready to serve God in this way. We are always open to receive God’s Love, God’s Will and instructions to assist our younger brothers and sisters upon the Earth.

One day, you too will be as we are, filled with this Love to such an extent that you desire to love each and every soul you meet, to be in service to God, to meet His Soul with your love and to know God better and better with each prayer. Yes, love for your Father will bring you closer, will show you the way and will teach you about Him, the Sacredness of Him, the Personality of Him and the Divinity of Him. With every breath, pray to meet your Heavenly Father, soul to Soul, joined in this Love, taken into His Arms of Love and blessed forever. This is the nature of Celestial Angelhood and this is where you are going, step by step, prayer by prayer.

God bless you, children. God bless you as you walk this path, feeling God’s Love pulling you toward Him with us at your sides, helping you every step of the way. I am Matthew. My love is with you and will always be with you. God bless you, dear brothers and sisters.
