This dear soul, waiting for her beloved friend to receive promptings from the angels, and I want her to know that I wish to speak through her. For within each soul, there are many gifts. There are many attributes and faculties and when one truly takes themselves to task, desiring to come to know their true essence, to be able to acknowledge within themselves that which is a barrier to the expression of the soul, it is a journey, a studious journey of being willing to allow God into every fiber of their being. For the barriers to be transformed, where once there was darkness, there becomes light, where once there was judgement, there becomes love and acceptance. Your greatest barrier is yourself.

You may like to think that if outside influences or individual circumstances would bring forth their best self, it is easy for you to meet them. But that is not how it works in truth. For when one desires to awaken the soul and to have a beautiful union with God, as you go about your path, you begin to see how your inner workings trip you up and in some ways are illusionary. For all things are remedied from within you. All things that you carry are the inhibitors and also the demonstrators of light. So, when you are troubled or challenged by another, you must have that rectified within you.

You can surrender these old patterns, these ways of being, these ways of perceiving and also these ways of protecting yourself and invite God’s sweetness. God’s transformation upon these things that inhibit your true nature, which is love, to flow from you and as you courageously do this and can maturely take ownership of your life in this way, you will find a strength. Soulful strength that can stand in its demonstration of power, humble power knowing who you are. I do not mean this from a material point of view or to say, *“I am a child of God.”* This can be a superficial expression. I wish for you to experience the aliveness of this, the realness of knowing all things are possible with God at your side, God at the helm, God waiting for you to turn and seek transformation on the barriers to your soul. Do not waste this Earthly life that you have been gifted or wait until you go into spirit to experience the beauty and the depth of your soul. Here and now is all you have. So if you wish to continue allowing the pains, the sorrows to be in the forefront or to even allow them to be used as an excuse, you are limiting the wonders of God and the experience of your soul awakening.

I am absolutely not judging anything or anyone. I am merely speaking the truth. When you can honestly have the strength to see the pieces of you that are out of harmony and courageously, privately between you and God offer these up knowing with great faith that God will attend to these aspects within you and bring you into wholeness, releasing you from suffering because it is love that transforms. You walk the path of love. So see yourself compassionately without judgement and give God that opportunity to show you the power of His Love upon that which stands between your soul and God’s soul. The human conditioning that inhibits the depth of the experience of having heaven on Earth. For heaven is within you, and that is what you can try to attain each and every day, one drop, one step, one thought, one action closer as a heavenly Being.

So, fear not what you see within yourself. Moreover, have the courage to come before God and ask with sincerity for the transformation of the barriers that keep the two of you apart. You know God to a certain degree, but there is so much more to experience. There is so much more available. Do this for yourself, beloveds. Come to know who you truly are, this jewel, this flower of beauty, strength and joy, so many, many qualities, gifts and facets lie dormant within you. Hold yourself in high regard. Take care of your soul and allow the expression, the deeper expression of the essence of your soul, to demonstrate itself in your daily life.

Use your time well. The time is now, and you will always be deeply appreciative of every effort you make when your time comes to transition into spirit. God bless you, beloveds. I am Barbara, so pleased to be with you. God bless you.
