September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2024

State College, Pennsylvania, U.S.A

Jesus received by Al Fike 

May the power of the Holy Spirit touch your souls. My beloved brethren, I come. I am Jesus. I come into your midst, the gathering of my brothers and sisters who indeed do persist in the Truth of God’s Love. I come to be with you in prayer to reinforce your desires and your longings that you may be deeply touched by God’s blessings of Love. I come because I love you, each of you, beloved souls. You seek the highest love, the greatest blessing from God, as do I.

Together we are a formidable force of light in your world at this time. The angels are diligent in their efforts and pursuits to utilise this light in the world, so you become a generator of blessings. All of us together are bringing blessings, channels of love into this world. These blessings are touching your families and your loved ones, the many who are seeking truth. To those who are in pain and suffering in isolation, comfort is brought. To those who are in need of healing of their bodies, healing is given. To those whose souls are longing for the truth, the passageways, the possibilities for them to discover truth are being cleared and extended by the great Lattice of Light that grows as a result of your efforts, beloveds.

Each of you are contributing in a most beautiful and powerful way to the upliftment of humanity, to the bringing of truth to others, to being a source of light, comfort and healing to others. To yourselves, a great blessing comes. A great light is shed upon you, raining down upon us, this Circle of Light. Blessing, blessing deeply our souls, helping us to open and to be in alignment with our Heavenly Father, solidifying the power and the glory of our unique souls coming together in unity for the purpose of receiving the great gift of God’s Love.

We are one, beloveds. One in love, one in truth and one in service. So, we gather this day to seek to be in harmony with God’s Will, to truly be touched by His Love and to be that channel of love in a world that thirsts for love, to be that instrument of peace in a world that longs for peace, to be within the Will of God which flows forth in healing, in light, in upliftment and comfort. Today we are His instruments. May you feel and know the Touch of God deeply and know that you are being used as His instruments upon the Earth. This day is a gift given as you give the gift of your presence in prayer.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother. I am your friend. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
