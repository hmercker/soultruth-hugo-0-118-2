# Soul hugs

September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, TN, USA

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

I come in the love of God with an affirmation that each one in this circle will be transformed through prayer by the Father’s love and as the song [^1] goes *“who would have guessed we’d be so blessed in and around, through and through?”* This journey that has led you all here to be with your Divine Love family is an endless, eternal, and immortal journey.

When you look back at your time on earth, you will truly understand why it is said this is a blinking of the eye. For those who store up their treasures on earth often file for bankruptcy in spirit. Your souls, seeking not only the highest but reaching for the true wealth of spirit; Your treasures are stored up in heaven. As you sit in the presence of the heavenly Father’s grace, your souls open to the great inflowing of His love, you touch on eternity, and your soul begins to perceive its walk beyond this earth life.

When you maintain your prayer, you bring this gift to the world. And yes, you may not convince everyone of the reality of God’s love, but you certainly can give them a soul hug. This hug from your soul gives an imprint, I would say, an indelible mark of light, for the light in your soul represents the portion of love in it, and as brother Yogananda has said, all healing is in light. So, what a healing thing to share your light beyond the words, beyond the beliefs, beyond the limitations of those things in the simple hug from your soul with an open heart with anyone in need who is willing to receive it. They will one day ask, what is that I felt from you? Then, you will find the truths that you hold that may resonate. Of course, some will be open, and some will not. You plant the seeds; God does the harvest. Be not concerned with this. 

There are many here and they will share with you, and I am honored and grateful for this time. And you see, the showering of God’s love is being demonstrated outside your windows. I shall come again, and I thank you for this time. With all my love and the blessings of God. I am your sister in Christ. I am Care. May God bless you.
