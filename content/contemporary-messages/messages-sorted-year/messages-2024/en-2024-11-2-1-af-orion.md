# Divine Love is the Key to Interstellar Communication and Avoiding Distortion and Distraction

Orion received by Al Fike

Greetings and love to you, beloved souls. I am Orion. Indeed, the most important thing you can do is to continue to lay the foundation of love within your soul. For without this foundation, nothing else can truly come into place that is clear and of truth, unadulterated by mindful concerns and conditions of your earthly plane bringing distortion. So, that which receives and that which generates light, which is your soul, must be pure and transformed by the great gift of the Creator of all, the Essence of the Creator of all. As you are in alignment with this, you receive this gift and it becomes a substantial part of your being, then other elements and possibilities of perception, communication, knowledge, compassion, love and peace dwelling within you can be a part of you.

There is a level of communication, of interaction, that is interstellar. It exists within the framework of God's beautiful creation of humanity. I use the word humanity for all creatures who possess a soul and who live in God's universe. It is our hope that one day humanity on Earth will be in contact and communication with humanity that exists elsewhere. We begin this process with our own communications. We desire to make this possible without too much distortion and assumption that comes from a mind that has been polluted by various means and conditions in the earthly plane. Thoughts that suggest that we are something other than we are. So, it is a delicate matter forging communication with us and with others.

We do not wish to divert your focus from communication with your angel friends and with bright spirits, for this is crucial and very important in your development. They bring the context of truth that you may relate to and understand. We do not wish to distort this, for as we communicate and bring information through, it is easy for your mind to go into various frames of thought and assumptions that misdirect you from the common goal, which is truth, which is understanding the truth of your own soul and the capacities of your own soul. It is easy for your mind to flow into erroneous thought and ideas, frameworks of perception that are not altogether true. This causes concern for us, and it should cause concern for you. You know of others who are a part of your Divine Love groupings who have entered down this road of distortion, and it is of concern for you.

It is not that what they have absorbed in their research and understanding of things beyond that of the earthly plane is altogether false. But it is so distorted by mindful intrusions and the intrusions of lower entities, spirits who wish to capitalise on this eagerness of knowledge. Their understanding becomes highly distorted and the truth, unfortunately, is lost within that distortion. Although we can communicate with each one of you and to show you the way of communication with many others, we hold back on this effort until you are ready and mature enough to be able to integrate these things without too much distortion and distraction.

As we have often said, it is important for you to be settled within your soul, to lay the foundation of the Divine within it, to be cognisant and truly understand the power of love that governs and fuels this journey towards consciousness. We will continue upon this vein of intention, desire, thought and prayer, so that you are well established within that realm of the consciousness of the soul. When it is well established, other aspects of consciousness can be explored and will be integrated into your experience in life. None of you are yet ready for this form of communication and contact. So, we wait. We wait with patience and with love, knowing that eventually you will all come to that place.

We wish to encourage you along the path of soul awakening and development, so that you may be readied for what is to come. For you must be ready when that time comes when the world is set on its head, so to speak, and everything changes. You must be ready and solidly grounded within the truth of love, the truth of understanding your own soul and understanding the Source of all Love and the Soul that emanates all Love. When you are in that place and you step forward into a world in chaos, your work will begin in earnest and our work will begin in earnest. All else before then is merely preparation for what is to come.

So, we speak of these things, of interstellar communication and connection because it will be a part of what will come. I stress with all seriousness that you must be prepared, not with high ideals and desires to foment these sorts of communications, but with the humility and grace that comes with the soul that desires connection and communication with the Creator of all. In this way, then all else may fall into place in its own timing and in harmony with that timing.

So, I urge you on, beloved friends. I urge you forward in all the ways and means that you may develop your abilities to see, know and communicate with all that is of light, all that is of truth, all that is in harmony and in alignment with the Creator of all. As you continue to receive this great gift of Love within your souls, so you will see for yourselves. You will prove to yourself the existence of life all around you and all within the universe. There is much life, much life indeed, and it shall and always will be in alignment with God's Laws of Creation and in alignment with light and progression toward light and harmony. You will see this for yourself. You will come to understand that you are a part of this great and wondrous dance of life that continues to head toward great harmony, expansion of Love and truth.

You are a part of this. You are still innocent and your perceptions meagre, but still, you sense and have some perception of the vastness and wonderment that is creation, that is your creation and the potential that lies within that creation. May you continue to grow in love, beloved souls. Seek out this truth and as that wonderful, beautiful man who walked the Earth so many years ago said, "Seek ye the Kingdom, and all things shall come." So, it shall, my friends. So, it shall.

Blessings to you, beloved souls. Blessings of love infilling your soul and creating a renewed and wondrous soul and being that you are meant to be. God bless you in love. I am Orion. God bless you.
