# Law of Divine Love

March 21<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

Moses received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am Moses. I come because I have a strong voice and you are familiar with me. Yes, there are many laws, many laws in the spirit world, many laws across the universe in the physical world, many laws of God to keep harmony and to bring about harmony in all of His universe. We know that God’s law of love, Divine Love, is at the pinnacle of all these other laws and when you pray, children, pray that you are open to receiving this Divine Love and that you follow the Law of Divine Love, that you manifest it. For this is the highest and as you seek the highest, this is the law that you seek to follow.

This law will encompass all the others. Pray fervently that you follow this law and that your soul accepts as much Divine Love as is possible and in accordance with this law that you manifest this Divine Love, express it, move it beyond your own being into the world in which you live. Ask God to help you understand this guidance, this law, everyday in your lives that you may find expressing this love to be easy [^1] and comprehensive. May God bless you. I am your brother, Moses and I thank you for listening to me and for hearing me. You and I have been together before. We will be together again. God bless you. God bless everyone in this circle.

[^1]: Moses used the word, “facil” which translated into English is “easy, effortless.”
