# Echoes the Importance for All of Us to Spread the Truths of God’s Love

I merely wish to say that what Augustine has to say to you is very important indeed. An active agent of God is what God wishes of each of you. As you continue to grow in His Love so that agency grows, so what you can accomplish grows as a reflection of the light within your soul, as a reflection of God's Will through you, which is accepted and acted upon more readily as your soul grows in wisdom, light and love.

There is nothing that will hold you back from this, beloved souls, other than possibly a reluctance, a shyness, trepidation as you move in the world. For your experience in the world, at least for many in this world, has been that of fear, of rejection, of bullying, of condemnation, of lack of love. But you are stronger than all these things. You have moved beyond fear of these things. You are God's children, children that realise their place with God. So, what is there to fear? What is there that holds you back?

Some of you are very expressive and assertive in bringing light, connection and love to others. Their personalities reflect this gift. Others are more subdued and reserved. That does not mean that those who are reserved cannot express love readily and beautifully. It is just in a quieter way. Each of you must be true to your own personalities, your own individual selves. Yet indeed, as you come to realise God is using you, that God is acting through you, then that must and will, indeed, help you to gain confidence and a realization that you are not working alone. You are working with God and God is working with you.

Be brave and walk in the light of His Will, His Presence. The beautiful gifts that He has given you expressed, not hidden away, but expressed beautifully. My beloved and beautiful friends, you are His channels of Love, and you are indeed beautiful souls. God merely wishes to use you often and with such diversity, opening doors of opportunity so that you may be used often, effectively, in light and expression of love. May you be blessed beloved souls. God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you. Each one I see beautiful gems of light, beautiful souls giving and living in love. God bless you. God bless you all.
