# Each of Us Has to Clear Away Those Things That Are Disharmonious Within Us

April 21<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, I am George, George Stokes. I come with my blessings for you beautiful children of our Heavenly Father. So many here in the flesh and in spirit. I welcome those in spirit who are new to step into this circle and receive the gift of Divine Love from God and feel the protection from negativities whether your own or someone else’s.

I bring my message of love to you all today from this glorious place in the Celestial Heavens which took, for me, quite a while even though I was so very active upon the Earth in building a community of Divine Love followers. Each of us must clear away those things within us that prevent God’s Love from coming, truly, completely and deeply, to transform our souls into souls of Celestial Angels. It is not just the doing. It is the praying. It is the receiving. It is the harmonizing. And changing of those things within us that keep us from completely loving and expressing this Divine Love.

So, my dear children, in addition to doing all that you do which is wonderful for spreading the word of God’s Divine Love upon humanity, remember to dig deeply within yourselves, praying to God to transform every part of your soul that is yet to be changed into this Love. Have your moments with God. Speak to God. Open to God and allow that Love to come in, frequently and eventually continuously. With these words of wisdom, I will step back and pray with you. As with all my brothers and sisters who are here now, God bless each and every one of you and may this transformative Love fill every part of you. God bless you. I am George and my love is with you.
