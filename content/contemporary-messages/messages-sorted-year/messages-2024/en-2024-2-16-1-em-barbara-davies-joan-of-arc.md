Barbara Davies & Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

…upon you. I am Jeanne, known as **Joan of Arc**. I come with many blessings for our travellers. My strength is with you on your journey. My love is with you. All of God’s children are with you. You know you are greatly blessed, but you don’t know how greatly blessed you are. Yet, if you look upon the faces of these souls who gather in prayer with you, these are a small number of those who are indebted to you for your work among mankind on behalf of our Heavenly Father. Continue to seek the Love and express the Love in your travels. Where you will reap many, many more benefits, and as you have been told, many challenges and many blessings. We, in the Celestial Heavens, and your good friend, Barbara, who is close by, support you in every way upon your journey.

May God bless you, guide you, lighten the path for you upon this journey and the others that will be coming. God bless you. God bless you. I am Joan.

…, my beloveds, I am **Barbara**. I will be right there with you every step of the way. You will feel me. My love will surround you and give you great protection and upliftment. You see, I am never far away from you. I will always be with you, for our love is strong. Very strong, my love for you, and I see your love for me. I do love you so.

God bless you. As we embark upon this journey, I will be close, very, very close. God bless you. I love you dearly.
