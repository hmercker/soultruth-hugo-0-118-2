Bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea atta Kem. We continue to uphold you and to minister to you. As you seek the Father’s Love, so you draw your angel friends close, so we are able to benefit you through our gifts and the blessings that will come through our gifts from God to you.

You see, God ensures that there is a chain of light that travels from Him to all things in the universe, through many different conduits and instrumentalities, so that you may benefit and even the Earth may benefit from God’s blessings. God’s expression, God’s Spirit continues to manifest through many different avenues. When you receive the great gift of God’s Love, God utilises what you call the Holy Spirit in order for you to receive it. But, there are many other conduits of God’s blessings that come through to whatever appropriate channels and receivers there are in the universe. This is not just humanity and what is humanity spread throughout the universe, but it is also your animals, your friends that are of the four-legged type, creatures of your world and other worlds, the Earth itself and all the planets that are alive. The workings of the universe benefit from the flow of God’s beautiful blessings upon it.

It is a very complex and beautiful system that God has created. It is perfect and indeed continues to strive toward harmony. You and all things are a part of this. God makes possible the blessings that will benefit you and the blessings that will benefit creation, coming through, pouring forth continuously and abundantly. So, life is blessed, Indeed, life exists because of these blessings. You are blessed because you are a part of life, but you also have something that is very special and unique that does not exist in the animal kingdom. It exists within the soul of the individual, able to receive this great gift of Love. 

All the animals, have been given the gift of life and all the creatures of God’s creation have life within them. Even the rocks, the soil and all parts of God’s creation have a measure of life within them, but you have more than this. You have a soul that allows you to be transformed and changed into something different. Thus, you benefit from the great Essence of God flowing into you. This Essence of God is not the same as the essence of life that God has given to the universe. It is something very special, a great gift offered by God to all His children, all humanity and all humanity throughout the universe. 

This gift is given for your benefit. We will continue to support you and carry you within the light that helps to facilitate your receiving and your desire to receive the great gift from God. When you are in that condition of seeking out God, seeking His Love, then you open the door, the floodgates are opened for this gift to be given. Allow yourself the blessing of this gift and seek to be in that condition of desiring and yearning for this gift. Utilise your prayers, your conversations and communing with God in order to receive. So much is given freely from God and indeed you benefit from the highest blessing of all.

How wonderful is this, beloved souls? We all may benefit from this great gift and we will all journey upon an eternal path that will ensure that we are blessed forever. God is beyond generous. God, in His Love for us, has given us the key to awaken all our faculties, all our potentials, all the beauty within, with the Essence of our Creator, empowering and enlivening these things through His Love.

How glorious is His creation, to create a creature such as us and then endow that creature, if it so wishes, with the great blessing of His Essence, His Love, to awaken us further and further along the eternal path. We are truly blessed and indeed our love and appreciation for God goes out to Him every day, every moment. This, I hope that you will do as well, sending out your love, your appreciation and your gratitude toward God and what He has created. Because when you feel that way, when you express those feelings, then you increase the light around you and you increase the possibility of receiving more of His Essence, thus creating greater light all around.

My beloved brothers and sisters, those who indeed seek the highest truth and walk the high road to eternal love, we are all together, connected, a part of one another, a family and we will stay that way for all eternity. We are brothers and sisters upon the path. How blessed, how blessed, my beloveds. You will continue to be blessed and awakened and find your way on the Divine Path.

We continue, always seeking for the highest. Always progressing upward into greater glory, greater wisdom, love, joy and truth. God bless you, beloveds. I am and I love you. My brothers, my sisters, upon the path. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you and we will continue to journey together with many other angels, mortals and spirits, all yearning, all receiving, all enveloped in the Love of God. How wonderful this is. How beautiful is the journey. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
