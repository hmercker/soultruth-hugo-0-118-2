Joseph received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, Joseph and I walk with you children, every day of your lives. I will always be here to assist you in your endeavors to progress in this love of the Father. I come to announce this truth to you, that there is more love in all of heaven that is available to each individual soul, more than you can possibly imagine or fathom. So, I encourage you to pray. Pray deeply, ceaselessly. Attune yourselves to the Father’s will that He may guide you through each step that you must take in order to be reborn in the light of His love.

More and more people will be coming into your spheres, you may call it spheres of influence if you like. They will be attracted to the love, but they won’t know why. They will come close, but they may not say anything. So, you may begin with this simple truth of extending your love to each soul who comes to you, and they will respond. There will be dialogues. Be gentle in how you explain that God is a God of love. Be gentle and express your love with each word that you speak.

You know the truth. Focus on expressing your love as you speak it. For this will do more for that soul than a discussion. I trust you, each of you, to do your best as you bring more and more souls to the Father. It is your desire to do so and as you focus upon the love in your soul being extended to every person who comes to you, then, you will succeed in bringing another soul to your Father. May God bless you. May you feel the love that the Father pours down upon you now. God bless you. I am Joseph, the father of Jesus and my love is and has been extended to each one of you. I love you.
