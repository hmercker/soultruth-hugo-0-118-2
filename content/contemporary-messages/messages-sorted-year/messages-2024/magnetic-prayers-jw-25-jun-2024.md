May the love of God come into every soul here in this circle. May it permeate your being as you simply open your heart, open your soul that God may reach in through His most Holy Spirit and bring that inflowing of His Essence. 
  
When one considers an object, pictures it, and holds that picture, there is a magnetic force within the law of attraction that brings the desired object into view and often into the possession of the one who desires it. When ones’ desires are inharmonious those thoughts bring lower spirits and often nefarious actions. Simply said, ‘Whatever your condition, whatever your mindfulness, when you allow your thoughts to be informed by the longings of your soul; the longings to be loved, the longings to be happy beyond momentary satisfactions, you draw the Angels. 

And no matter what your circumstance, when you move beyond concern, worry, grief, or perhaps the drunkenness of being over medicated to the simple longing of your souls, you open the doorway for a healing, for the love of God to come in and bless you. All because you have raised your thoughts, which in fact is a form of prayer. 

For as you may know many people pray for material things. And of course, if you are hungry, you would be praying for food. If you are lonely, you would be praying for companionship. If you are ill, you pray for a healing. All these prayers within the human condition are answered, each in their own way. And the human love and human empathy is not to be dismissed. For if only the world brought this love, this kindness, this consideration of the preciousness of life to every soul there would be peace and much greater happiness.         
    
When you go to God with all your heart, all your soul, and you speak maybe without words or maybe with these simple words: “Dear God, put my soul in Your soul, touch my heart with Your love. Change me.” The answer that comes from our loving Creator is transformational and so much more than a momentary fix or adjustment. 
   
Your future in spirit will make this life however full, however empty, seem like a moment. And yet, here you are. You are not living in the spirit world though you have a spirit, and you can connect with us. But there are earth requirements and so we encourage you to fulfill your requirements. To help bring peace to the earth, food to the hungry, shelter to the homeless, healing to the ill. Above all these things yet embracing all these things, is the love God, which embraces the natural world the human condition and yet is lifted above it.
           
May your prayers be simple. May you allow this great love to guide you and put each one in the flow of Grace where one begins to see the great harmony that is underlying what appears to be almost chaos or disharmony. And I say this to you; The power and majesty and presence of God’s love will always outshine the darkness; Will always conquer any evil. For the entire Universe rests on the love of God and your prayers align you with your Creator and all your friends here in spirit and most especially in the Celestial heavens. 
 
May the love of God be yours forevermore. 
   
I am your brother and your friends and a redeemed soul in Christ.   I am Luke. Go in Peace.
