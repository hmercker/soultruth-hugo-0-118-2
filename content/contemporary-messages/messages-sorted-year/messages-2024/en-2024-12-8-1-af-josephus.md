Josephus received by Al Fike

May the deep blessings of the Holy Spirit touch your soul. My beloved friends, I am Josephus, and I come to speak to you about the great blessings and resources that are available to you. Each soul upon this world is not disconnected from God's blessings but may receive them daily. Every moment, every breath of their lives these blessings may come, given their desire to receive and their receptivity to the Touch of God upon them.

These blessings are many, the greatest of which is the inflowing of the Essence of God into your souls. This transformative blessing is unique in the universe and is given by God's grace and Love for each one of you, for all of humanity and all who inhabit the universe who possess a soul. They have the opportunity to receive this gift and from this gift flow many other blessings.

Much is given to the soul, nurturing it, awakening it and bringing its gifts alive and conscious into your being. God gives the gift of healing blessings to uplift your spirit and to bring harmony to that spirit to help cleanse your material mind of all its clutter and bring harmony to that consciousness that you possess. This helps to disperse the conditions around the soul so that you are more receptive to the great gift of Love.

God gives and blesses you with His angels and with bright spirits, beings of light who come to uphold you. This tremendous resource is given to you freely, provided you draw these things to you, as the Law of Attraction works and brings this blessing forth. You benefit from the gifts and abilities of these beautiful spirits and angels that surround you. You receive guidance and impressions. You receive protection and light. Many things come, especially with the celestial angels who have been redeemed in the Father's Love. They bring many gifts, channels and portals of blessings to you, for their gifts are awakened in Love and you benefit from their awakening.

The chain of Love and blessings flows through so many toward you. Even the beautiful Earth in which you reside gives blessings of healing energies and conditions that you may benefit from. Not only this, but it also produces the food from which you are able to be sustained physically. It brings the sunlight that warms you. It brings the rain that sustains all that is upon the planet. The elements that come from Mother Earth, you utilise and benefit from greatly.

Then there are beings from other planets and galaxies who are able to reach out to you and connect with you in ways that you may find unbelievable and astounding. Because they are gifted, blessed and awakened, they are able to make contact with you readily and without any harm or difficulties that you might experience in this connection. For the vast majority of you, that connection is very subtle indeed, just as it is with your angel friends, but it is there and they bring their gifts and their blessings to you.

Then there are the creatures of the world that God has created. Some of these creatures are your companions. They bring love, they bring comfort to you and they are often a source of healing for you and bring you peace. Some provide sustenance for you. There is much that God has created to benefit humanity, such a vast array of resources that come and are readily available.

How blessed you are, beloved souls. How blessed you are to know the gifts that God provides for you. God provides in Love. God provides with His blessings, generosity and care for each of you. Take full advantage of what God gives to you, but do so with wisdom, moderation, consideration for your world and that you may not harm or cause distress for this planet of yours. For it is indeed in great distress and when you pray for this world of yours, you help ignite the resources that may support and heal your world.

Pray for one another, for each of you possess gifts and in your prayers, God may utilise those gifts to help another. Pray for your children and your loved ones. Pray for the leaders of your world. Pray for all of humanity, that indeed, with enough inspiration, love, strength, light and upliftment, humanity may make those choices that will ignite the great flow, the deluge of blessings that may come to each one. Indeed, in prayer, the doors are opened and the blessings flow.

With insight, as your souls grow with awareness, you are able to recognise, acknowledge and appreciate what is being given so abundantly and freely. With love in your heart and souls, you are able to bring love and light to the world. You too are a resource for the world, for God has created a universe that is filled with the intricacies of many blessings that flow forth. When you are in alignment with this, you know the vitality and the blessings that come and you become part of that vitality and blessings that flow in the world.

Be that beautiful, bright spirit, mortal soul that is highly attuned, sensitive and in alignment with the flow and blessings of God's creation and God's great Soul. It comes to you freely, but it requires your dedications, your receptivity and your desire to be in this alignment, to be truly a part of this great network of blessings that God gives to you and to all of humanity.

Be that bright soul that you are meant to be. Be that beautiful child of God that you are, acknowledging this and appreciating all that God has made, all that you are and all that creation is. Be humble, gracious and kind in the world. In this, you will receive and benefit from what you give out into the world. It comes back to you, beloved souls. It must. It is a law in action. It may not come directly or in the same way given, but it comes nonetheless in many blessings.

May your life be heartfelt, sensitive to all the nuances and subtleties that are profound and powerful in your life and that have been created by God. Be grateful for life and honour it, beloved souls. Most of all, seek out the presence of God in your life, to have God with you, in your heart, soul and consciousness, to love God and to be open to God's Love for you. This will ignite all the awarenesses, all the capacities and abilities of your soul to be in alignment with God and God's creation. Love will flow freely. Light will be yours and peace will be within you and around you.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Josephus and I love you, beloved souls, precious to God, precious to the angels, precious to the universe. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
