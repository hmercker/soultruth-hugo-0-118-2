# Follow Your Dreams

I am here. I am your brother in the love of God, Yogananda. 
   
I wish to speak about dreams. Have you ever wondered why people will say: "Follow your dream; may all your dreams come true; or even dream on?" What is it about dreams that have caused these expressions to become part of the vernacular? 

When one dreams, the consciousness, which is generally centered in the material mind, goes into the soul. And you have certainly heard the terms *‘astral traveling,’ ‘astral world’,* and *‘astral body’.* These are all terms for the spirit body and its travels in the spirit world. It is not unusual for one’s dreams while in that sleep state to be influenced by their fears, their hopes, their desires, both high and low, and yet, one who goes into the dream state in prayer and meditation, not only attracts bliss and joy, but the celestial spirits, who then can influence you. As my brother<sup>1</sup> here knows, we sometimes come to him at three or four in the morning with a message, or with a poem, because, like most people , during his waking hours he is busy, and this is a time when we truly can reach you. 
   
When your dreams are of the type where you have a re-union with a family member in spirit or a vision of an angel, something otherworldly I would say, and you awaken from this state, feeling as if what happened in the dream was not only real, but so profound as to be more real than life in the material world, you can sense that life in spirit is more real and certainly without the limitations of the earth life. 

For a soul comes into the world encased in a womb, released into this material realm having all its wonders and yet all of its limitations, carrying with it the karma and its consequences of those who came before, whether they be your ancestors or collectively all who live upon the earth. And so, a soul who is aware of this finds a way to be freed from the vibrations of the material world and its bondage, and I tell you that prayer and meditation releases one from the consciousness of the material world to the awakening of the astral and beyond in the celestial realm from where the Divine Love flows and even the spirit body becomes transformed in oneness with God. 
   
As your prayers become more intense and the love of God fills your souls, and you receive the great gift which comes with freedom and joy and bliss but also the perception of life in spirit and the freedom that lies ahead. So, yes, follow your dreams that they may they be filled with angelic beings as your soul reaches out for the love of God where we are all one. May God bless you, my brothers and sisters and may you be lifted in His love. I am your brother and friend, in the love of God. I am Yogananda. Go in peace.
