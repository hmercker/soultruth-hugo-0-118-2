# Angels Cannot Do Their Work Without the Help of Instruments on Earth Who Can be Seen and Heard

Received by Al Fike 

Children of God, I am Aaron. I come to assure you that as you venture forth into the wilderness of the human condition, we will be by your side. We will lead the way, clearing the passage so that you may be a light and that you may do God’s work. My beloved friends, what you are able to do as God’s instruments, we cannot do. For you are in the flesh and have the capacity to move in the world seen and known by others who are with you upon this world. We are unseen and often unrecognised. God is unseen and often unrecognised. But when we have an instrument who is both seen and recognised, then we have within them a precious gift, a gift of their presence and their light. 

So, we encourage you, beloved souls, to venture forth, to be that light and to be inspired by the Creator to bring truth, comfort and love wherever you go. As you listen to this request from God and embark upon your journeys, know that we are with you, that we shall travel with you. We shall accompany you on your daily tasks and we will be by your side always. Every moment of every day you have your angel friends close. As you continue to pray and beseech God to use you as His instruments, His channels of love, then God will orchestrate the situations and conditions, the passageway for you to serve as you desire, as you have prayed to be that light. 

Do not hold back in your instrumentality, this beautiful light that you carry. It is given to you as a blessing and is given because you have asked for this blessing. But when you receive it as you have, beloved souls, it is then your responsibility to be a light in the world. To not shun the world, but to venture forth into it. As you do so, you will be protected and guided. God will show you the way to those individuals and situations where you may be used as His instruments. God has many plans for you, each one of you. God will show you the way on that passage, that road that is specifically meant for you. The events upon that road are ones that God intends for you to engage with, and to be His channel for love and light, for truth, peace and healing. Many things God wishes to express through you, through your soul. 

You must have faith that God will do so. You must trust in God’s Will and you must acknowledge the light within. For without this acknowledgement, you see yourselves like so many others see themselves, without true purpose or gifts or light. You become part of the crowd, mediocre in the greyness of life that is so prevalent and predominant in your world. Yet, you have the potential to be that light, to stand forth and to be recognised as a light, to give, to give and to give in the flow of God’s Love in harmony and will, blessings abundant. Miracles will be performed. Many who are in need shall be fulfilled. Those who are seeking the truth, shall find it. 

These are the works that Jesus did while he was on Earth and has said that you and anyone who is in alignment with God may do these works, these works that are God’s doing and God’s Will. Trust in your capacities and abilities to walk in the world as a light and to be open to the guidance and intuition that will lead you forth and bring you to those situations where light is needed, where individual souls are yearning. Where there is great, great need and deprivation, you will be guided. As you trust in this and step forward, it will be manifest for your eyes to see and your soul to acknowledge that truly, God wishes for you to be His instruments, to be those channels of light and love in the world, to be the harbingers of truth, to manifest many blessings that cannot be denied, but are indeed true and palpable. 

Be that light, beloved souls. Trust in the light that is within you. Trust in the gifts and capacities that reside within you. Trust in God’s plan for you. In this trust, in this faith, you will have an extraordinary life, a life filled with many blessings, a life gifted with many opportunities. Your needs will be met upon the road as you meet the needs of others you encounter. Where much is given, much is expected, beloved souls. We do place before you the opportunities, and we expect from you your detachment and attachment toward that which is of light, service and love. You have great responsibility, beloved souls. 

Indeed, provided you embrace these responsibilities, you will know the great blessings of God upon you in such abundance. You will experience extraordinary things in your life that you would not expect and you will be fulfilled in this. God does not take from you, beloved souls, but gives to you much and gives to you many responsibilities and possibilities to learn and to grow in light, to truly be all that you can be as a child of God in the light. Be true to yourselves, beloved souls. Be true to the Will of God and all will unfold in harmony, peace and joy. Indeed, you will find yourself upon a journey, a road less travelled, a road filled with great promise and great blessings. 

May God bless you in His Love, for this is the key to all that I speak of. As you grow in His Love, these things will manifest. You will expand, develop and be transformed by it. My beloved friends, you are surrounded by angels. You are blessed mightily. I am your friend, Aaron, and I walk with you. God bless you, beloved friends. God bless you. My love is with you always.
