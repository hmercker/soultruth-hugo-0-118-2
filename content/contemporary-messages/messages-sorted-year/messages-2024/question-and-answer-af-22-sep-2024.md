# Q & A for Poughkeepsie Retreat

September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Poughkeepsie, N.Y. U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike 

Thank you for inviting me, my friends. I am Orion. Unfortunately words are such an inelegant way of communication. We, on our planet, communicate by thought. Thought, not of the material mind, but thought of the soul. The way in which that thought is formed and conveyed is so very different from the material thoughts that you convey and form and communicate often in words. So many things are different Yet I come, not only as an observer, but as one who wishes to teach and to uphold you in light. To bring universal truth to you in such a way that you might understand it, and hopefully to inspire you to walk through avenues and doorways of experience that will bring you to a deeper understanding of truth. 

There is one universal law that continues to be consistent, powerful and foundational, and that is the Law of Love. The universe is permeated with love. Indeed you have come to know the highest love and the gift of love from our Creator. Thus you step upon a road that will lead to many awakenings and understanding of deep truth because you have realised that this cannot be obtained without this love. The soul cannot be awakened without this love. The soul, when awakened, has many faculties and abilities that are far beyond your mental material state and can bring to you in subtle and powerful ways truth and understanding that cannot be accomplished and realised in material ways. 

The soul is the eternal part of you. The soul is the core. It is the great light that brings life to your being, and it is much more. Our planet reveres the soul and reveres the Soul of God. To some this may sound religious. But no, it is a way of life. It is a way of being that brings greater harmony. As our planet progresses in time and space, so harmony increases and expands as our souls continue to be nourished by the great Soul of God. So, we will begin with our questions, dear daughter. 

**Thank you, Orion. When will we be free on this planet in unity and safety?**

Well that is a very difficult question to answer. You see, every planet, every being on every planet that has a soul is imbued with the gift of free will. With that gift choices are made and individuals continue to progress through the experience of choice, the expression of choice and the realisation of choice. Unfortunately on your planet many have made unwise choices. They have followed the directives of their material desires. They have brought to themselves the fulfilment of material expectations and priorities, thus creating a very material world, a reality that is of the mind, a reality very different from our own. 

Since the power of free will reigns upon your planet as in every planet, then the realisation of freedom, whatever that might mean within your mind and your ideas, is subject to the free will of humanity. God is always bringing to His children upliftment, love and light to help clarify and bring into the consciousness of humanity what it is that is harmonious, what it is that follows the creation of God and the laws of that creation. 

But it is up to the individual, in soul and mind, to hear and to take in that information. They have a choice and that choice may indeed bring them to the realisation of what will bring harmony, freedom and unity into their lives. But then, since so many around them are not subscribing to these higher principles, they stand alone. They are not unified. Yet, that condition of freedom can be obtained by the individual. 

Freedom comes with harmony and obedience to the laws of creation and the laws of love. These ultimately bring conditions of harmony within the individual, a joy for life, a joy in the understanding of life, the purpose of life. That understanding and that subscription to the laws that bring harmony can bring a measure of freedom. Indeed, the choices that the individual makes to get to that place of freedom are many and must be considered each step of the way, each breath, each thought. A discipline of thought and action must be in place in order to be in harmony with the laws. Thus, it is a great effort to be in harmony.
 
On top of this effort is an overriding and powerful element. That is the element of Divine Love residing within the soul. With the gift of Divine Love growing and becoming a powerful influence and determinant upon the individual’s road toward freedom, it is not such an impossible task and it is not such an arduous task. For the Love helps to augment, transform and define the road to freedom and joy. As you come to receive this great gift that God offers to you and to all souls in the universe, then the possibility of this freedom, if the freedom is what I believe you think it is, can come to you. When it does, when you feel it and know it, then you may convey it to others. You may be the example that others might follow. In this chain reaction, so to speak, in time the entire world may know freedom. But, how much time? How long this will take is determined by each individual’s free will choices and capacities to walk the road toward greater light and greater freedom. Thank you. 

**A lot to think about. Orion, how thin is the veil on your planet between the material and spiritual planes? Is communication and materialisation a part of everyday life?**

There is indeed a separation between the two, for on one plane there is the element of a physical body and on the other plane there is the element of a spirit body. Indeed we live many, many more years upon our material plane than you do upon yours. But, a time for transition into the spirit does come in time, possibly seven hundred to a thousand years in duration of life on our planet. There are great advantages of having merely a spirit body, a body that does not need material sustenance, a physical body that by definition has a heavier condition than that of the spirit body. Although, in contrast to what you experience on your planet, the makeup and density of our material body would be similar to that which you experience on your Sixth Sphere. 

So there is very little difference between the two, but there is a crucial difference. Indeed, with merely a spirit body that houses the soul, then the need for sustenance, sleep and satisfying material functions is not required. Therefore we are able to live moment to moment without the regulations of night and day, sleep and sustenance, functioning. So our lives expand in the spirit world. There is only one true plane upon our planet. There is no need for the progressive layers and levels of your spheres because we have already progressed to that place of what you call a celestial being. Thus we enter into the celestial plane readily as we release our material bodies, and that is a place of great joy, of great freedom, of great possibilities, even greater than that which we have experienced on the material plane. So we are happy to make that transition. We are also happy to live the many hundred years that we have upon our physical plane. 

It is a very different set of expectations and conditions that we deal with between the two levels of being. Indeed we honour and are joyful to experience the physical life in all its ramifications. We also honour and have great joy to experience the spirit life and all that it has to offer. So it is not a difficult transition for us. It is joyful on both sides of the veil when we transition. Those who love us are happy for this transition. Those who love us upon the material plane acknowledge and congratulate us that we have lived a life well-lived. Those whom we meet and know in the spirit plane, indeed greet us with great joy as they would most likely when you transition. So it is not a difficult thing between the two worlds. 

Yes we have many opportunities to communicate. For we have soul perceptions and abilities in the material world that allow us to see, hear and communicate with our brethren who are in the spirit world. So it is a happy environment, no matter which perspective you have. One of joy, one of ease of communication, love and acknowledgement. Children are not bereft when parents pass into the spirit world for they can communicate with them readily. Indeed parents are not bereft that they are without the possibility of being with their children in the flesh. For they have, in essence, ease of communication and rapport with their loved ones. It is not a difficult scenario. Nor is it rife with barriers or obstacles. It is the ease of this flow of communication that makes for great joy on both sides of the veil. Thank you. 

**Orion, when stellar souls permanently leave their physical bodies, do they take a spirit body with them and where do they go?**

I believe I have already answered this question. 

**I think you have too. Thank you. If God created us and all the universe, who or what created God and why?**

My friends, if you have the answer to this question, could you please inform me? For I do not have this answer. It is what you would call a chicken or egg scenario. What came first? Did God come first? Did the God of God come first? These things are often the fruit of the material mind, these questions. God exists and we exist. Can we not be content with this reality and leave the speculation of the mind to possibly a future awakening and understanding that may come as the soul progresses upon the eternal path? As such, I do not have these answers.

I have visited many planets and talked to many individuals and I can assure you that they do not have these answers either. But we do not, as you would say, lay awake at night thinking about these things. It is not relevant to the here and the now. What is relevant to here and now, is who am I? How am I? How might I express myself in this moment and be in this moment? For I am the creation of God and God has given me the opportunity to exist at this moment. What a blessing that is. Thank you.

**What a blessing. Now we come to the last submission for this retreat’s Q & A. Lisa says, “You said on your planet you eat mainly fruits, vegetables, pure water and flavoured beverages, also natural.” Orion, I trust that you have now heard the six questions three times now. Would you like me to read each one or do you feel that you could take it from here?**

It is important for this medium’s brain to know the questions as stated. So yes, I would like you to read them. 

**Should I read them all or one at a time?**

You may read one at a time. 

**Are there other food groups like nuts and seeds and mushrooms?**

There are many things that grow on our planet and yes, we do utilise the nutritional value of these things. Our bodies require very little in the way of sustenance. As I have indicated, the refinement of our physical is very much above and beyond what yours is. Our bodies are not heavy like yours and do not have great requirements like yours. Much of what we consume is for the pleasure of the consumption rather than the need to receive it as sustenance, although, of course, we require sustenance. 

But much of what is given to us and what we absorb becomes in a spiritual way, in the way of energies and blessings from the Creator. But yes, even this light and beautiful body that we possess does have a need for sustenance, and yes, we might eat seeds and nuts and mushrooms. Although I have never tasted a mushroom. So I can not say that it is the case. Though I am sure that upon my planet, which has somewhat diverse cultures, that may be the case. For there are mushrooms that offer some sustenance. Although the vibration, as you would call it, of such a form may be quite low and not pleasant to consume. 

**The second part, are the natural beverages on your planet like our fruit juices and herbal teas?**

We do take fruit and break it down into juice and pulp and whatnot as you do. Then we dilute these juices with water and we add other additives, minerals and such that enhance the flavour. So yes, we have the opportunity to consume these beverages. Hot beverages are not common because our planet’s climate is warmer than yours and there is not often the need to consume something that increases our body temperature. But at times, this may be the case. There are those who live in northern and southern climates that may require such things. 

God provides many things in the universe and God puts within each individual a creative urge and desire to make of the world what they will. Of course our directive is to do no harm to our world. But that does not mean that we are restricted in our ability to create such beverages and to create the ways in which they may be warmed and have sustenance. So yes, there are many variations in our diets and the way in which we approach diet. I hope this answers your question. 

**Do you eat cooked vegetables?**

At times, depending on the fibre content of that vegetable, it is more pleasant to soften it and cook it. We have a mouth with teeth and a tongue and oesophagus and a stomach just as you do. So yes, to chew and to consume things we must, or we elect to make it a pleasant experience. So we might cook these things and add different seasonings and minerals to them in order to make it more enjoyable to consume. 

**Do you use herbal medicine?**

There is very little need for medicine of any type because we receive our medicines through our diet. Our physical bodies are so refined and so in harmony that there is no disease upon our planet. We may use herbs and whatnot to enhance the flavour of our food, but it is a benefit in a roundabout way for our bodies to do so. Thank you.

**Do you use recreational drug plants or caffeine?**

This is amusing. Many people use these elements in order to feel better, in order to escape reality, in order to add a quality of joy to their lives superficially. What need do we have for these things when we have all that is of joy, all that is good? So we do not indulge in these things and we have not for all the length of our time as a species upon our planet. 

**The last question that this group has submitted is, will our diet transition be natural, like we will be sick if we don’t, or mandated? Jesus said he hasn’t given us any commandments yet. Should we start now?**

These things are of the mind, commandments, edicts, diets, all manner of mindful expressions that the mind believes will bring about a healthier, happier, more harmonious condition. This way of living, of controlling, of advising has been with humanity since the beginning. I ask you in all seriousness, how has this benefitted you? Certainly there are things that have helped to ameliorate and alleviate pain and suffering and indeed, until you come to that place of true awakening and harmony, they are a needed element within your daily life. But to come to harmony with God, the individual must come into harmony with their own soul and their relationship with God’s great Soul. In this, all disease and all disharmony eventually is wiped away by this one great gift. This is the way to harmony. 

I have said this many times and I have said this today, to set forth edicts and pronouncements as to how an individual might live is to follow the old way of being that is and has always been, in a way, irrelevant. It has caused more problems than it has solved. So it is important for you to find your own way, to find the truth within your own soul, to find the wisdom that your soul carries, to pronounce that wisdom to your conscious self and to live by that wisdom. If you can do that, then who needs another to pronounce for you? Is there a need to have rules and regulations if you are guided by love and wisdom of the soul? 

I know I take a great leap in my logic here, for you are as a species and as cultures, countries and societies far from this state. But I would urge you, my friends, those of you who have elected to receive the great Love of God, to ask for solutions through this process. To see what might come as guidance for you and to act upon it. This is a great test and a great adventure in understanding how one might live in harmony with the laws of God. Those laws are understood by the soul and the soul perceptions. Indeed as you walk in the world, you are required to live in the world to some degree. But are you truly of the world? That is the question. Can you be an individual who follows the leanings and wisdom of your heart rather than of the mind? All those things that reinforce the conditioning, ideas and perceptions of a material mind must be subjugated by the greater and higher thinking and understanding of the soul. When you can do that, then there is no need for rules. There is a day-by-day expression of life that is in harmony with the laws that are readily understood by the soul. 

Try to be that individual. Do not look to impose rules on others. Be the example. Be the light. Present love above all else. Indeed as I have said in the beginning of my talk, words are inadequate. But love, beautiful love flowing, embracing, accepting and honouring another is the most powerful agent and teaching that one can give. So I urge you to be that channel of love, that beautiful light, and to do so with grace, to do so with honouring God’s laws and to be His child, His child of light, a true channel of love. In this way, you will reach many, many more than if you were to present them with edicts, ideas and pronouncements that are essentially of the mind although they contain truth. The mind of another is more willing to accept and to be with you when love is presented first and foremost and a simple truth is offered with love. 

So I believe we are finished with our Q & A time. I hope that you have gained some inspiration and insight from it. Know that I am close and that I have great love for all of you. That indeed, I work with your angel friends to help uplift humanity, to help uplift each one of you. We are simpatico as you would say. There is no difference, truly, between us and your celestial friends. For they are our friends and we work together as brother and sister upon this planet. I am honoured to be able to do so. I was invited by your brother, Jesus, to do so. So, I come in response to his loving and earnest call. What a blessing that is for me and indeed, I might venture to say a blessing for you. I am glad to be here and I shall continue to be here to support and uplift you, and at times to guide you. Blessings to you, my friends. I am Orion. My love for you is great. Always, blessings of love. Thank you.
