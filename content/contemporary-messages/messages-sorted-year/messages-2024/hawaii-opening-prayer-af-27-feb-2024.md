May the blessings of the Heavenly Father rain down upon you, beloved souls. I am Martha, Martha of the Bible. I am your guide, beloved, beautiful daughter (D). Indeed, I am very close and I am very happy to greet you all here. For we have worked diligently together to prepare this place of prayer and love and beauty. You are here, and we are joyful that you are here to bring the Light of the Father’s Love more fully into this place, to this island, to those who dwell here. This is our task as we come together, my beloved friends, to bring greater light into these places. 

There is great need here. There is great anxiety and anguish here amongst many people. Though many of you call this place paradise, it is paradise lost because of the influences of those who have come to make this place subjugated to their will. So you come to build up light to neutralize the darkness, to make harmony and light here. It is a formidable task, beloved souls. But each of you have been utilized in many places to bring this light forward, to help God bring blessings to His children upon this place. Those who are seeking will be drawn in. They will feel this blessing as well. Many will feel this blessing, will feel uplifted and carried in light. 

My beloved friends, pray earnestly. Not only for yourself, but for those around you, for your families, your loved ones, for those who are in need. As this beautiful couple continue on their journeys, each place that they attend to will be blessed and light shall shine forth as they join others in prayer. The beginning of a fateful journey, the blessings pouring forth, beloveds. Open your souls wide to these blessings of love. Open yourselves to the blessings and teachings of your angel friends. 

Indeed, your questions are important, your concerns, your curiosities. All those parts of you that are yearning for truth, bring them forth. Bring them forth and continue to ask those questions that are burning within your soul. Indeed amongst you are many answers, much that can be given to help you to have clarity, to help you in your prayers, to help you in your daily lives. Be strong in love and allow your love to flow to one another, building the conditions of light amongst you, creating harmony and peace and joy together. This is important, for how often are you together in the flesh? How powerful this can be. Utilise every moment that you can, beloveds. 

Even when you are breaking bread together, you come together in light, and we are with you, urging you on with your questions, urging you on in your desire for greater light. All these blessings come no matter what situation you are in. Whether you are driving in your vehicle, whether you are praying together as now, whether you are eating, even sleeping in the same home, these things all contribute to building the light here and in this region. We utilise you every moment, every moment, beloveds. 

Thank you for gathering. Thank you for making that decision. Indeed, do you not see that once the decision has been made, that the doors open? They fling open wide and the opportunity is given. Do not concern yourself how you are blessed. Merely to strengthen your faith, you’re understanding that when you do God’s work, those blessings come abundantly and all solutions come to your dilemmas, these conditions of your earthly plane. How blessed you are, my beloved friends. How joyful we are to have you together in this place as we continue to build the light, prepare and to infuse the great Portal of Light so that it is powerful and can be used in many different ways for the blessings that will come, that are a part of this plan to help humanity in this place.

Many will feel this when they enter through the doors. There are many who are waiting, beloveds. I know, my beloved daughter (D), you feel alone and that you do not invite many into your home. But that will be changing, beloved, that will be changing. You will feel compelled to invite others and you will show them the way of prayer and bring the peace and the light and the love into their midst through this Portal that is developing and strengthening. There is a plan. Provided you are willing to listen and to be guided, this plan will be realised. We all have free will. Indeed, do not allow your wilfulness to inhibit God’s plan and Will for you, but be at peace. Know that you are loved and that God has a plan, indeed, that is great and beautiful.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Martha and I come with the scent of lilacs, the beautiful scent of flowers, and I love you. I love you all. I am honoured to be here amongst you. Channels of light and love, I am honoured to be here and shall work diligently to help bring greater light to this place, to my beautiful charge (D), to all of you and those who are coming. God bless you. I love you. God bless you.

**It is Seretta Kem.** God bless you, beloved souls. It is fortuitous that you are here contributing to our beautiful Circle of Light that you have been a part of for a number of years now. For we can utilize chemicals and energies here while you sit and help to integrate these with the other sitters, helping in their development and yours. This interchange happens in this particular framework of prayer and development. So I thank you beloved souls. You are being utilized in many different ways and blessed in many different ways. 

Such a lovely light, such a beautiful place. The soil is rich in minerals and energies which can be utilised for development. It is good that you put your feet firmly upon the ground, for this is how these things are transferred and how we will metamorphize them so that we may transport them to your friends, your fellow sitters all over the world. Yes, there are many aspects, many ways and means to utilize for the development of each one of you, your gifts and abilities enhanced in this way. We thank you for your continued efforts and we are blessed, indeed, by your dedications and your prayers and your willingness to be used as God’s instruments in many ways.

God bless you, my friends. I am Seretta Kem and I wish to make this comment about how fortuitous this situation is with our work together. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
