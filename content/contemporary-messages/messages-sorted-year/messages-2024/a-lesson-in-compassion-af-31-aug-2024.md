# A Lesson in Practicing Compassion to Reach Soul Consciousness

Blessings to you, my friends, I am Orion. I urge you to have compassion, compassion for yourselves and compassion for others. A world that is indeed out of harmony and lacks much love requires compassion, requires your unbridled compassion for others. I know that each of you conducts your life in such a way that it is within the parameters of experience and connection with others that is comfortable and does not challenge your innate biases and fears, regarding these relationships. 

I would urge you to stretch beyond these parameters. For some of you, they are quite narrow and they are informed by fear and prejudices that keep you from feeling compassion for others. I am not saying this in order to engender defensiveness within you, merely to point out that as you continue to confront your humanness, your weaknesses and your biases, that you must practice compassion in order to not allow the conditions of your mind to dominate your actions.

Within your soul is a great deal of compassion. It is a much freer perspective of life. Yet as we have told you so many times, this perspective is not the predominant perspective in your life. You still allow and continue to feed that domination of the mind and the perceptions and biases of the mind. When you practice compassion, you are contradicting this combination and you are allowing more love to flow through you to another, accepting others who are difficult to accept within the parameters of your own ideas of what is acceptable. You must go beyond these places that have been created from life experiences, from teachings and programming that come from very early in your childhood. 

Unfortunately as the parents and teachers teach their students and nurture their children they, in a subliminal way, teach fear for they use fear as a motivation for children to learn. This is most unfortunate. Now that you are adults and mature adults, it is time to put away these old paradigms of thought and to allow the soul to infuse a higher level of thinking and perceiving into your being. Your soul is brimming with light, with love, with compassion, wisdom, with discernment, with many things. It takes practice and effort to put aside the old worn patterns, the old you and adopt the new.

We encourage you, beloved souls, to look at this carefully and consider this well, how you might change, how you might let go of those difficult patterns, those restrictive patterns, those unloving patterns that bring much judgement and fear into your consciousness. You have the Hand of God upon you, my friends. You are surrounded by a retinue of angels, stellar friends and bright spirits. What harm can come of you my friends, when you are in the light as you are? The only way that you make yourself vulnerable is to continue to foster these unfortunate conditions that I speak of. This opens the door to the possibility of attack, maybe not in a physical way, but in an emotional and intellectual way. When you are pure and strong in purity and wisdom, you become unassailable. For even if situations may be present in your life that might cause you harm, you will either have the wisdom to diffuse them or you will have the guidance to avoid them.

Trust in the wisdom of your soul, my friends. Trust in the capacities of your soul to have great compassion and understanding for others. Every soul upon your planet, every soul created in the universe is unique. They will have their own perspectives. They will have their own ways of living their lives and dealing with interactions with you and others. You must honour this and allow this to be, rather than the impulse to correct and to judge. Be compassionate and, to use a common phrase, easygoing with your brothers and sisters. God does not intend for this world to be stamped out in a certain way and expression that is homogeneous and shared by all. No, God enjoys the diversity. God has built into His creation, diversity and God intends for diversity to continue to be expressed throughout His universe.

Is it your job to correct what God has created? Is it your job to impress upon another your will and your ideas as to how they might behave? Is it your job to shun another? No, my beloved friends, your job is to love, to accept and to encourage the highest in another, not in a way that engenders guilt and defensiveness, but in a way that inspires and brings to another a sense of the possibilities, a joyful understanding, that they are loved and that they are beautiful.

I encourage you in this way, my friends, let go of the judgement and let go of the biases and let go of all restrictions in life, to be that light pure and simple, inspired by God, guided by God. In this way, you will fulfil what your souls desire and what God desires of you. It is not that complicated although you certainly do have a tendency to complicate many things. The simple truth is that when one is in harmony with the laws of love, then one will express harmony in all things in their lives, with all people they encounter, with all situations in the world, even though the world may cause you complications and obstructions.  You have the capacity, the ability to deal with these things without emotional negativity and judgement, fear, all of those human things that hold you back from light. 

Be true to your soul, my friends, and in this you will be true to the light, the harmony, the peace to the Love that God has brought to you and will continue to bless you in such profound and transformative ways, with His Love creating within you a beautiful expression, a beautiful example of what the transformed soul might become. May you be blessed, my friends. Orion loves you and will love you and love you and love you. May you love yourselves as you are loved. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
