I am here, Elizabeth. I come to you in this holy communion, this gathering of souls, each one committed to this prayer, to having their souls blessed. My sister and I, so long now in spirit and in the celestial realms, we look upon our earth lives as a blink of the eye, and yet, our simple way and the deeper truths of that time conveyed by Master Jesus that you are all privy to have brought, and continue to bring, the great possibility of transformation in the love of God. 
   
Mary and I, we were not great minds, but we lived from our heart, and therefore that clarity gave us a womanly perception of the Master’s mission of the equality of all souls, of the great gift that had been conferred and was being made available to all. Throughout the ages, there are those who have studied in great depth all the philosophies, all the creeds, all the great words of the poets and playwrights, and yet, they were bereft of being able to see with the clarity of soul. 

For those who wish to analyze the great truths, I say to you, there comes a point when one must actualize with whatever understanding one has, the longings of their soul, with the opening of the heart. As has been said many times this requires humility, so often lacking in the world, and yet, all are humbled in the face of physical death. All are brought down to the simplicity of the heart. 
   
A prayer really, on many levels, is the wish, not only to receive the love of God, but to be healed, to be free, and to be lifted. When one is a recipient of the Divine gift, one cannot help but serve others with the love in their souls. When you let go of the all the considerations, all the analysis, all the trying to weigh ‘Where am I on this journey?’, when you let go of this and allow the love of God to be your guide, to be your teacher, you can live in this prayer, you can walk in faith, you can bring hope to those in need, and joy to those in despair. For truly the great hope of the world is to be transformed in love. 
 
So, please take the gifts of this prayer to the world. It is not complex. It is the simple act of love and for all here, Divine Love. May it be yours in great abundance, the very essence of our Heavenly Father, who loves us unceasingly and welcomes us in the warm embrace of His presence. I thank you and I love you. I am your sister in Christ. I am Elizabeth. (The mother of John the Baptist)
