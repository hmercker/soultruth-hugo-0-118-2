# Our Love Touches Your Souls

January 17<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Barbados

Mary Magdalene received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. Mary Magdalene. I come to give you my blessings. I come because I cherish you, each soul. I come to acknowledge the truth that lives within each soul which makes us brothers and sisters. Deep within your souls, we are connected and all to our Father. You may trust this connection and as you dive deeply into this beloved part of you, you will feel us for many of us have blessed you with our love.

Many of your brothers and sisters who have ascended into the Celestial Spheres have touched your souls whether you know it. Touched you with our love and this is how we may communicate with you, through this precious love that is within your soul and ours. It is a very beautiful system that the Father has engineered so that we may be in touch with you and you may be in touch with us, so that you may call upon us and we will be with you and love you and as I say, cherish you. It is the will of God for us to do so. And it is our will. For such is the nature of this love that we share it, that we be it and that we bless you with it.

May the Father’s love pour upon your souls. May your souls open and open widely. And may the Father’s love renew you. I am Mary Magdalene, and my love is with you, each and every one. God bless you, my beloved brothers and sisters. God bless you.
