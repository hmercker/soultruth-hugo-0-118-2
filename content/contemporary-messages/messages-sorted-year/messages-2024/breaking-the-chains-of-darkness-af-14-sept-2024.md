# Break the Chains of Darkness and Liberate Your Souls

Received by Al Fike 

Beloved souls, I am your brother Jesus. I come with great compassion for humanity, for the word of man has been lost in the great cacophony of words, thoughts and ambitions that are not in harmony with creation. Though the word of God lingers in the hearts of men, it is not heard or acknowledged. So it is that humanity suffers in its own delusional state and condition that does not include, nor is it aware of, its purpose and the meaning of creation. So few are aware of the truth. So few understand the potency of the truth that humanity has been created in love and in that creation, all that humanity can express is in love. With love comes harmony and with harmony there is no suffering. 

Yet for many, many millennia, from the beginning of time, humanity has chosen not to listen to the word of God in its purity, in the form that it takes within the heart. Rather humanity chooses to adorn its idea of the word of God in its religions, philosophies and ideas of the mind. We come to you to urge you to break this cycle, to break the chains that hold humanity in darkness, to be the harbingers of light in the world, to break the chains of darkness within yourself, to break the chains of ignorance and error that continue to hold humanity in that state that is out of harmony with God’s laws. 

It is a task that is overwhelming, that is difficult to see your way through and to understand your part in this great effort, this plan that God has to help liberate humanity. But each of you, beloved souls, can play a part. Each of you is attempting to break the shackles. Each of you is seeking truth and each of you is seeking the blessings of God. So, you are those lights upon the world that have the potential to change the course of human endeavour, to help humanity see that vulnerable and tender part of themselves that is within them that cries out to be with God and to know Love, Love Divine. 

Seek these parts out within yourself. Seek what your souls long for. Seek to unshackle your soul and be liberated in the glory of God’s Love. As you do so, you will become transformed and strengthened. A great clarity will come to you and the ability to lead others to the Holy Waters of His Love that they may drink and quench their thirst and drink some more. Can you do this, beloved souls? Can you step forward in the ways that God intends for you to do so? Can you truly be that liberated soul and express yourselves in the joy of this liberation, in the wisdom of this liberation? In the light and power of this liberation, which is the expression of your soul claimed by God and expressed in the Truth of God?

It is a mighty task, one that requires many. But every effort that is made starts with the few, but grows as those few take up the torch of truth and stand forth against the current of darkness. I urge you to seek out God and to know God’s Will to liberate each one of you from your pain, from your error and from your darkness. You have felt the Hand of God upon you. You have known a touch of that liberation, that hope that resides within you. So, as you continue to uncover the light within and to help bring greater light within, you will be a light that shall call forth other souls to join you in this liberation of the world from its darkness and its pain. 

I am with you in all that you do, beloved souls. I stand by you and all that you are and all that you attempt to bring to the world. I shall never leave you, ever. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I am with you always and forevermore. I love you. Truly you are my brothers and sisters and I love you. My beloved brethren, shall we find the ways and means of unshackling humanity from its burdens? Shall we march forth in truth and be the liberators that God wishes for us to be? Shall we know the joy and the wonderment of being God’s children, free and blossoming in truth? It is for the light bringers, the peacemakers and the truth tellers to be that light, to bring the key that shall unshackle humanity. 

God’s plan is working in many different corners of the world. God’s plan shall be realised soon enough, for how much pain can the world hold? How much heaviness brings the world to its knees? How much error can be spoken and accepted? Rather, truth must rein supreme and love must be the currency of your world. May you find your way upon this road, this plan that God has devised and is enacting. It shall unfold not only in your lives, but all over this world the unfolding of God’s plan will be realised. The liberators will be called forth to help bring peace everlasting to your precious world. My love is with you always. I am with you always. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
