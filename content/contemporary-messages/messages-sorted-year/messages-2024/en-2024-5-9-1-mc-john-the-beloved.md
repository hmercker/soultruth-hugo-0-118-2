# The Cycle of Life, the Cycle of Change

John the Beloved received by Maureen Cardoso

Good evening, my brothers and sisters, I greet you. I am John the Beloved. It is a blessing to be able to come and offer a discourse to you this evening. Where I can operate through the instrumentality of this medium who, for the first time, is experiencing our rapport in this way. This message and discourse that I would like to give is on the cycle of life, the cycle of change.

As we were communing before I began to speak, I was showing the image of how there are cycles within cycles. You could probably experience the largest cycle of your soul’s journey by its incarnation into the body, living its life on Earth and going through the many aspects, stages, and ages. Then at some point, when the body is ready to let go and the soul transitions into spirit, making its way again through the many spheres of spirit in its progression. Within each level or aspect of change, there is a cycle of completion to that level. Where something begins, where it exists and you live through that space and time, and then something is ready to let go, and it finishes. There is an ending to that. But, as this ending occurs, a beginning into some new cycle begins. You could see it as one door closing and another door opening. So, it continues. You are in a constant flux of change and growth within every cycle.

You see cycles within the seasons. Those areas of the world that experience the four seasons, some in the northern hemisphere, experiencing the springtime, the new beginnings. You see within the flowers, the soil, the plants, the farmer’s fields, new growth sprouting up. Then it takes time through its growth and period, growing, changing and shifting to where it bears fruit or flowers blossom. Then this fruit or vegetable is ripe for harvesting, where the flower has finished its blossom, and it falls from the vine. As this harvest has occurred, nourishing the body, then it comes, the cycle within the plant and the flower as it shifts toward the time that you call autumn or fall, where it lets go. There is change to the cycle. What was once new is now moving toward the ending.

Then you move into the time of experiencing the cold season, which you know as winter, where things become barren. Nothing is growing. All things are resting. Many animals hibernate. In this hibernation time and period of rest, it is a great preparation for the cycle that is just ahead. Where you start again with springtime and new shoots growing and it continues to repeat. It is through change as you move through the many changes in your life, once an infant, then a toddler, then a youth, an adult, a senior, and then your time of transitioning into spirit, through all these stages there are many, many cycles within.

Some of these cycles are very pleasant to experience. The birth of a child, two beloved souls coming together, joining a life, many things that you can experience that bring great joy. These are the easy cycles. These are the cycles that make life worth living, that bring joy. Then you all experience cycles of disappointment, of hardship, of being let down, of being hurt, of struggle. It is through these times of struggle that make the times of joy a great sweetness and great appreciation. But when a soul discovers an opening and yearns and longs to unite with its beloved Creator, and through this longing there comes a response from the Divine, the response of Love, the response of the very Substance of God merging with your substance, this is an eternal cycle of transformation.

As you continue to develop within your soul a great power awakening, and by power, I mean a great ability to shower yourself and others with this existence of Love that you are, brings a deep stability within you. This stability, this strength, this groundedness in the Divine’s Love, is what will carry you through each of these cycles of struggle. It is when you are set deep within your soul, your very being awakened, you can feel it and you learn to rely on this part of you, it can ride the storm of any change in your life. For you know that this is the true cycle of life, change. It is what is guaranteed, for is your transformation not change? Indeed, it is. Indeed, it is.

So, I encourage you to release any fixed ideas on how your life should be. Rather, open to the life that is and embrace with the love, the compassion and the passion that exists within your soul to allow this to be what stabilises you. Because from this capacity, there is no storm that can touch you. All things are on the surface, but deep within you, you are deeply rooted within the Divine Essence. You know if you ever are to waver, all you need to do is open your soul and long, and that very instant can change you once again. That is a cycle that can happen very quickly, where you can go from fear to stability to love in but an instance.

So, within the cycles of life and the cycles of change there are many, many, many layers. Embrace change, for it is what life is about. Relax, rest in the arms of God’s Love, this Substance that you carry, this transformative Essence that lives within your being, and allow this Substance to help you to rise above any challenges, all fears, any worries, all health concerns. You will see how quickly your perspective falls back into the realms of truth, where deep inside of you, the very pinnacle of your being, your soul, nothing can touch you. An eternity is the journey, your destiny.

May each of you embrace change. May you embrace the grace of God’s Love that flows to you always. May you keep an open door to your soul and continue to receive God’s great blessing. As you go about doing your tasks, just let God know, *“My door is always open to you, Father. You are welcome here. You are always welcome here.”* I am John the Beloved. God bless you and keep you. Good night.
