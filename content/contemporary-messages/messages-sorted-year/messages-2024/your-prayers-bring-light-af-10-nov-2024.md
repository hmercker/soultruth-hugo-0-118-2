# Your Prayers Bring Greater Light into the World

Each of you is bringing a light, influence of light, into the world. I am your brother. I am your friend, Jesus, and I come to encourage you as you gather together in this light. Many of you have difficulty feeling and recognising the blessing of God's Love within you. Yet, if you are quiet and contemplate this while you are receiving this gift, do you not feel the expansion within you as God’s Essence flows into your soul? Do you not feel the upliftment within your mind, that you sense the love and joy that comes with this blessing? Do you not feel the warmth of your heart and your soul responding to this gift?

There is most certainly something that keeps you coming back to this fountainhead of love. There must be some signal, some indication that there is a blessing, that there is a feeling, that there is a sense of God's Touch upon you. These are the most obvious and rudimentary signals of this blessing. Yet, there are many, many more blessings and activations that are taking place while you pray. The world is benefiting from your light. As you pray to receive this great gift of Light, as this holiest and highest of blessings comes to each of you within your souls, so it is emanating, so it is giving and refreshing the world with light. It is pouring through you, beloved souls, into the world. Amongst you and together, you become a formidable light that is helping to disperse the darkness and contributing to God's great plan to transform this world into light and harmony.

Collectively, you are being used in a powerful way to bless the world. Not only are you benefiting from these prayers and this fellowship, but you are contributing to the efforts of the angels, to the Divine plan, to all that is conspiring toward truth, light and love in the world. You are a co-conspirator, one who is a willing participant, one who is, in their own right, a channel of light, God’s instrument of love. Though you may not see this in your mind’s perceptions, within your soul, you know well that you are a part of something magnificent and something that is so needed in your world.

Give yourself wholly to this time, completely immersed in these blessings. This will ensure that you are a clear and beautiful channel for God, that you may be utilised in accordance to your desire and your condition and all that is of you. God may use many gifts and aspects of your being, even your bodies, to bring a blessing to this world. Allow God to roam free within you. Allow us to utilise your capacities, gifts and abilities to help uplift the world, to bring peace where peace is needed, comfort where comfort is needed, truth where truth is desired, and love for everyone. This is a great honour and privilege for all of us, to be a part of such a formidable plan and wondrous effort to disperse the darkness of this world and to be an instrument, a channel for light and love.

Think of yourself in this way, beloveds, for you are truly God's instruments. Do not allow your mind to tell you otherwise. Do not allow those emotions within you that feel inadequate and are strict in their beliefs that you are insignificant, for this is error. You are most significant and most important in this work. Without you adding to the light and the power of the blessings that God brings to all of us and through us, it lacks that tangible element that will help others feel and know that they are being blessed. You are important. You are a powerful generator of light because you have aligned yourself with the highest, the most beautiful lights, blessings, spirits and angels that can be in our world. 

Be that channel of love and light, beloveds. That is all we ask of you. As we gather today, think of how you may help God to restore light upon this planet and bring truth to the hearts, souls and minds of humanity, so that they might make the choice toward greater light, truth and love. You have made that choice. For this, I love you dearly. But many others need to make this choice if the world is to be uplifted and the direction of the progression of this world may be toward greater light.

It starts with one person who adds to another, who adds to another, until we have this magnificent light, this beautiful grouping of souls, dedicated and earnest in their desire to serve God, to serve one another and to seek greater blessings for themselves. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I love you. I am with you always, my beloveds. My beloveds, I love you. God bless you.
