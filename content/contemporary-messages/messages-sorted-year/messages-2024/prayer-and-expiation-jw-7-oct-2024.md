# Prayer and Expiation

It is I, Robert Lees, your friend, and brother, in Christ, who resides in the celestial heavens. I am drawn by your grateful hearts, and your empathy towards the world and others, especially those in harm’s way. 
   
When I began to receive messages from spirit, I was often made aware of the many quotes about the love of God but mostly I was impressed deeply by the Master, promising eternal life for those who followed his teachings. And I began to realize the brevity of my time on earth and so I devoted myself to receiving from the angels a presentation of life in spirit, from the hells to the high heavens, and I was grateful for the magnanimous descriptions that I was given. 

Today, I want to discuss the idea of expiation for those who feel blocked and unable to break through the barriers they have created, often clinging to them for a sense of safety. There are those who would tell you that in order to receive the love of God through His holy spirit, you must eliminate these barriers, leading many to believe they are not worthy, they are not progressed enough, prayerful enough, knowledgeable enough. 

But the reality is, the ability of prayer coming from the deep longings of the soul and with all your heart is to bring your soul to the soul of God beyond time, beyond place, beyond limitation in the munificence of His grace. And the more you bring your soul and its longings to God, the more the results will be the dissipation of those barriers, hence, as you have heard so many times and I shall repeat, *‘seek ye first the kingdom and all else will be given’.* 

It is such a great truth that it does not require psychological evaluation, intellectual analysis, or studying all the great scriptures and philosophies to feel its effects. It is however essential for you to know every prayer is answered, and every true prayer brings the presence of God and the company of the angels, for in God’s time all is revealed, all are healed, all is forgiven, and most wondrous of all, is the great change that comes to the soul residing in the immortality of God’s love. 
   
And though you may wish to save the world, with the most wonderful of intentions, know this: that even if you can bring the great truths of the love of God to a single soul, it is worth more than all the stars and constellations. We in the heavens celebrate with great joy. We wish to embrace you on your journeys, every step of the way as you remember God and know we are there for you. It is our joy. 

May the love of God be upon you. May your worries fade away in this moment as the spirit of God, His most holy spirit brings the love into your souls. We are one. We are all His children, and we are loved beyond measure. I thank you. I am your brother and friend, Robert Lees.
