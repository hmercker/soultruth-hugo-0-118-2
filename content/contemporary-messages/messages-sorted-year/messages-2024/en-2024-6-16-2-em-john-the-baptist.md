Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I follow my brother in the Celestial Heavens. I, too, come to honour you and support you in your progression to our Creator. You all worked diligently, sincerely praying for the Love of our Creator to flow into your souls as the Master has taught us. We now ask you to go much deeper. Much, much deeper into your souls that they may be developed and expressed upon this Earth. Be those souls that will attract others to you who will desire to learn all that you have learned, and that you may give your love to, that they may also be inspired as you are inspired by Jesus, his example and our dear brother, Albert, his example. You have a work to do upon this Earth at this time to express all that is within you and to trust your Heavenly Father to give you all that you need, all the Love, all the Truth, all the blessings that you may share with your brethren upon this Earth.

I bless you [as my Master blesses you](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2024/en-2024-6-16-1-af-jesus/), as all of us here in the Celestial Heavens bless you and encourage you to listen to your guidance as we direct you and bring you those souls who will most benefit from your individual gifts and teachings. I honour you, my beloved brothers and sisters upon the Earth. May the might of God, the Love within your souls, the Truth that you know and live, be with you. May God bless you in so many ways. I am your brother, John, formerly known as the Baptist. I love you, my brothers and sisters. May you walk with God. God bless you.
