# Comes Right Down to Sit and Pray in Our Circle

September 15<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee

Received by Al Fike 

The one who is holy is here, beloveds. You have drawn in the Holy Spirit to replenish your souls, to keep your feet firmly upon the Path Divine. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to once again pray with you, for you have created such a light, such a condition together that I am drawn. I wish to sit with you in prayer and be with you as your brother. So we are together. Each one a soul, each one created by God, each one equal in God’s creation, each one loved dearly, exquisitely, profoundly, extensively by God. So, we come to acknowledge this love together. We come to love one another in this beautiful Circle of Light. 

So we are all united in the oneness of our love for our Creator and our acknowledgement of what God has created within us. We are His children truly and we are loved. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. God’s Love pours into you. Open wide. Open your hearts and souls to the elixir of life, the new life that comes with the Touch of God within your soul. Be in unity, harmony and peace. God bless you. I am your brother and I am your friend. Jesus loves you. God bless you.
