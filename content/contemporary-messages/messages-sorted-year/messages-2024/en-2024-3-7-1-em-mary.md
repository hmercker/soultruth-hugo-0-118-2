# A Gift of Healing

March 7<sup>th</sup>, 2024

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

I come to join you. I am Mary. You seek healings, my beloved children, and you come to God for them from the depths of your souls. Ask and you shall receive. Bring those troubles that you have to our Heavenly Father and He will bless you. Bring your love to the Father and He will bless you. Bring your longings and your false beliefs to the Father and He will love you, heal you and bless you.

Although you live in the Earth, you are true children of God. Although this Earth plane is dark, filled with darkness, your light reaches the Father and the Father's Love touches you, gives you more light and brings more light into your lives. You are true children of the Father. You know how to reach God, how to make changes in your lives and how to receive all the blessings that you require in order to live in this Earth, especially at this time.

I bring you comfort and we, many of us who are healers, bring you healings. We come because you ask God to heal you. We come because we love you. We are your sisters and brothers and we desire to uplift you during this time of prayer so that you may feel the blessings that the Father rains down upon you. I am here with many others who work on you as you pray. Open yourselves wider and feel all that comes to you.

May God bless you, each and every one of you. May the Father uplift you higher still, that you may have respite from these earthly conditions. God bless you. I am Mary. My love is with you always. God bless you.
