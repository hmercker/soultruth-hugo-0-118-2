# Encourages Us to Take Action

I want to encourage you to be proactive in your lives. For life is but a series of choices and a series of opportunities. When you act in wisdom and love, you might do that which is of light, that which is harmonious and hopefully that which is of God’s Will. You must step forward and you must act in order for any of these things to be manifest in your life. Without asserting yourselves, without choosing light and choosing to live a life filled with light, you become just another soul floundering around in the human condition without direction or purpose. Yet, you are given the highest blessings. God’s angels are with you and you are uplifted and upheld in light. Take full advantage of what has been given, my friends. For without your involvement, your dedication and your efforts, these things are merely blessings that can fade because you have not reinforced them with your actions and your thoughts.

Each individual must take responsibility for their lives. Each individual is given great opportunities to be an active agent for God. All that is required at the beginning of your day is to pray to be used as God’s instruments for that day. You will be surprised what may come, the doors that will open and the opportunities that will come through those doors for you to act upon. Even though at the beginning of your day you may not know what it is that you will do, as the day progresses that knowledge will come to you. You will be guided as to what you must do, given the circumstances and opportunities that are in front of you, given that you wish to avail yourselves of what is given.

My friends, there is no greater opportunity than the day that is given by God, the blessing of a day, the potential of a day. I urge you, beloved friends, to take full advantage, but to do so as God’s instruments seeking the Will of God, knowing the Will of God. God will make His Will known to you in many, many different forms and ways. It does not have to be a verbal directive and guidance that you would long to know and hear. Rather, it may be a simple gesture from another. Maybe a sign you see that will inspire you and direct you forward. It could be anything. God will find a way to communicate with you. We do God’s bidding. We work diligently to assist you upon that road of service, for we are all serving God. We are all seeking to do God’s Will. 

My friends, seek to do the Will of God with every day. If you feel isolated and alone, step outside your door and you will be surprised who will be drawn, the events that will unfold. There is much waiting for each of you. Do not squander your day or the moment, but seek to be used as God’s instruments. Even when you walk down the street, you are being used as a channel of light in the world. Even when you go about your business, go shopping for groceries, seeking to do a small errand, all these things are opportunities for God to work, given your attitude and desire to be a channel of blessings for others. 

It may not appear obvious. You may not see the outcomes and often, you rarely do. Still, when that day is done and you rest from your efforts, there will be a feeling within you, within your soul, that you have done God’s bidding. A sense of satisfaction will come to you. A sense of peace and contentment. Try it out, my friends. Try this out and see what I say to be true, for truth is never valid unless it is tested. I urge you to test the truth. Test what is given and what is guided and you will find the proof that you require. Again, in many different ways. 

God bless you, my friends. I am Alec and I am with you, helping you, helping to guide you. Helping you to see beyond the blinkered awareness of your mind to the expansive knowledge of your soul. God bless you, my friends, and keep you in His Love. God bless you.
