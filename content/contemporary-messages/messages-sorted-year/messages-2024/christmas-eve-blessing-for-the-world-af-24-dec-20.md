May the peace that passes all understanding, be yours, my beloveds. I come. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to be with you. Though I do not often come close to the Earth plane during this time, for there is so much that is not in harmony with the truth that is expressed with the Christian religions. Yet, there is joy and there is desire to bring peace and love to the world. This, I am encouraged by. For you, my beloveds, you bring the clarity of intention, desire and truth in your prayers and together, we celebrate the opening of the possibility of receiving the great gift of God's Love into our souls.

This came upon a day of my incarnation into the world. So, we celebrate this moment, this time that God gifted humanity such a profound gift, a beautiful gift, a transformative gift that is His Essence, offered to each and every soul who desires to receive it. Today, we affirm this truth. On this day, we anticipate the further development and awakening of our souls by affirming this truth. We join together, all brothers and sisters, equally loved by God, equally given the opportunity to receive this gift. Though I was the first, I shall not be the last who shall be touched by the gift of God's Love.

We celebrate the bestowal of the New Birth upon humanity. We celebrate the truth of this gift that brings all blessings, all peace and love to the individual soul. Thus, they become a light, a beacon, for the truth to be known in your world. Indeed, as you walk in your world as a light, there are many spirits in the lower planes of spirit who will observe you and will be curious as to why you are of light and what you do to foster this light within you. So, you become the beacon, the lighthouse and the example for all the world to see and not only your world, but other worlds.

This gift brings a powerful message from God. That message says, “I love you” and that each and every soul that God has created is worthy of that love. So, we celebrate our beautiful creation with the possibility of being God's child fully and completely, of being an awakened soul through the gift of His Love. We are all children of God, His family of Love and shall be evermore.

My beloveds, know that I love each and every one of you, all who partake of the great Essence of God and that I know each soul that does so. God knows each one of you and yearns to build this sacred relationship between your soul and His that we make the sacred journey toward at-onement. That we shall carry that great torch of truth together. That we shall be that beautiful light multiplied by many, many souls, bringing a light to the world that is so needed. That each soul that encounters this light is touched with an awakening, a stirring within, a longing for this touch, this love. It is for each of you, beloveds, to carry this truth, the torch, this light, this beacon into the world and tell your brothers and sisters of the possibility of knowing this gift that shall redeem and uphold and transform every soul, if they but ask for it to enter therein.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, upon this time of celebration and prayer. Know that you are well upon the way toward the Celestial Kingdom and shall enter therein in good time as your souls awaken and as God continues to touch you with His Love. God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother. I am your friend and I love you. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
