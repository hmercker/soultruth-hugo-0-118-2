# Be At One with God

September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Lansing, MI, USA

Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

The Breath of God is upon you, beloveds. You come together with pure hearts, sincere minds filled with desire to be with God, to open your souls to the inflowing of God’s Essence, to come to know this gift to be your very own, your very own blessing from God. In this blessing will come the closeness, the intimacy of your relationship with your Creator. For it opens the door to the consciousness of the soul, knowing God, being with God and understanding God. This is the only way to truly know your Creator, to awaken your soul with this gift, to pray for it often, to truly long for it daily. You shall be given all that your soul requires to be in alignment with your dear Creator who loves you so.

May you continue to be blessed, beloveds. Continue to be blessed in the holy Touch of God’s Holy Spirit and blessing, His Hand upon you. It is given. It is given in love. It is received in love. It is your redemption and transformation that comes, not because God loves you in such a way that He chooses. It is rather that God loves you freely and abundantly. So, this love is yours. This love is for all and can be given to each and every soul who desires it. It is the way to freedom. It is the way to the expansion of the soul, its transformation and its way toward at-onement with God. All is given freely, abundantly and in light.

You come together, beloved souls, to receive this gift. So, you shall. This gift may be given for all eternity for all the changes, healings and transformations that come with a life given by God. God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem. My love is with you, beloved souls. My love is with you and we shall start our prayers together. There will be many. Many blessings will come as you pray, beloved souls. God bless you.
