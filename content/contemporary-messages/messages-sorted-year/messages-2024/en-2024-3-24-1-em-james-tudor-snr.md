James Tudor Snr received by Elizabeth Mack

I am James Tudor and I come to commend you, my son and others in Barbados on the work that you are doing. You have long been ready and willing, and I am thankful that you are now carrying out your guidance and your passion for spreading the truth of God among your fellow Barbadians.

I just came by to congratulate you and to tell you how I am thankful for your work and of course, I will continue to be with you as you follow your guidance. May God bless each one of you, dear Michael, dear David, James, and our dear sister, Patricia. God bless you all. God bless you. The Fatherâ€™s love is with you. My love is with you. God bless you.
