I, too, am a mother. Many came to me because of my mothering nature. Many felt comforted and blessed, but it was not me, it was God. 
God’s Love is expressed in many different ways through many different people, depending upon your personalities and your gifts. Indeed, when I touched people, they felt the healing, comfort and love that flowed not from me but through me. This you must make manifest within yourself, nurturing your gifts and allowing them to flow. 

Many of you have some idea, some concept, as to what being a channel for God is. A channel for His Love. You look around you to others their examples and see how this is manifest. I say to you that God’s Love will manifest through you in your unique way and through your unique gifts. 

Do not compare, but ask God to show you what may flow through you, how you may express His Light and Love through you. The Love in itself, its quality is consistent. Each of you adds something. Each of you expresses something unique through your personalities, your physicalities, your mindfulness and your soulfulness. These things co-mingle together, creating a signature, a uniqueness that is all you. Do not limit yourself and your capacities for love, but be love in everything that you are and everything that you do. You will find yourself steadfast in the flow of God’s Love. Others will feel this and will gain comfort, upliftment, and the blessing of this gift through you. 

It is not a complicated matter. It is when you are truly who you are and express truly your own gifts and abilities, that God uses you powerfully, beautifully and harmoniously. You will feel this and know this. Those feelings and knowings will strengthen and multiply within you. You will be at home with God, at home with yourself, and at home with your gifts. It will not be a struggle. You will not manufacture an expression of yourself that comes from the mind. Rather, it is your authentic self, your true self, that is in the flow of God’s blessings through you. 

The journey is to discover your true self in the way of soul. Many of you do not truly know your own soul. You think you do, but often it is a manifestation of your spirit, your spirit body and spirit mind. You believe this is what it is. I tell you, you must go deeper. There is more clarity, and there is more to be known and understood. Be with God, and you will know these things. You will know your soul. You will know the expression of your soul. This will multiply and expand in the Father’s Love, and in the gifts and faculties that exist there within the soul. It is a journey. A journey that you must endeavour to be a part of and truly know with you. 

You must go deeper, my children, my beloveds, you must go deeper. You will find these things in your prayers and knowings of God. His Love continues to pour into you. This will release the true self in a conscious and beautiful expression of who you are and what you might do in the world as God’s true instruments, as God’s beautiful souls seeking the redemption,  the transformation that comes with His Love.

I love you, beloveds. I love you. I am Barbara, and I love you truly. God bless you. God bless you all in the truth, glory, and wonderment of His Love manifest within you and through you. God bless you, beloved souls.
