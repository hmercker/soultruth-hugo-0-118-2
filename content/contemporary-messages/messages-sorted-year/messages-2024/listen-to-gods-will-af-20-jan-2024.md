Received by Al Fike 


May the Father's Love continue to bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend, I am Jesus. I come to pray with you this day, this auspicious day, where this Circle of Light continues to form, grow and strengthen in God's Love and Truth. How precious is this Circle. I urge you to sustain it and guard it, to continue to fuel it with prayer and to bring the light that comes with the blessings upon your soul of God's Love. 

How important are these Circles of Light in the world, beachheads of light in a dark world. How we may come and be with you because of your efforts and your faith, your desire to grow in God's Love. The Law of Attraction is established and fulfilled. Your soul is longing for God and God is sending all blessings to you, the blessing of His Love, the blessing of His angels to surround you, the blessing of upliftment in light, healing and peace. all the goodness, all the richness of God's Touch upon you, beloved souls. 

Sustain this light. You have no idea how precious and powerful this gift is. This circle can be an agent of change for the world, an agent of healing and blessings for the world. You must commit and dedicate yourself to these efforts. Put aside your egos, thoughts and ambitions that may clutter up the Will of God. Listen, beloved souls, listen to God's Will, God's guidance for each of you. It shall come unimpeded. It is important that you follow the guidance given. That you walk the path designated. That through your faith and dedication, you become God's instruments together, a great light formed and expressed in the world. In this way, you will find yourself deeply blessed and deeply guided. You will find yourself in the grace of God always, in the blessings of God daily, in the light of God's Touch always and evermore. 

There is nothing complicated about this request, beloved souls. It is merely to spend the time in dedication together, in prayer and supplication to God, in asking to be guided and acting upon your guidance. How else can God work but through His instruments on Earth? How precious you are. For as our brother has said, it is the path less traveled. It is given to us as a responsibility and a gift to walk this path unimpeded and undistracted. Your dedications, beloved souls, upon the path of love shall put you in good stead as you pass into the world of spirit and find your place in light. 

You are known by the angels of the Celestial Heavens. You are known by me. You are known by God. You are loved, loved beyond measure, loved deeply, fully and richly in the Grace of God. Seek out this love, the nurturance of God's Soul to yours. You will be protected, never abandoned, guided and richly blessed. Much awaits you, beloved souls. As your soul awakens, so you will find the richness that is within. You will utilise the gifts that lay dormant but are coming alive. Be God's powerful instruments, beautiful instruments, effective instruments for change in your world, to teach the truth, to live the truth, to be the example of truth, to walk in your world as a light. These things are offered by God freely and abundantly. It is for you to embrace, absorb and accept. 

The road less followed is a road filled with riches and blessings that many cannot comprehend. They turn away to the earthly pleasures. I say to you the greatest pleasure of all is the pleasure of being with your Heavenly Father, knowing the Love that shines forth and feeling the power, beauty and glory of this Love infusing you, every part of you uplifted, blessed, healed and awakened. This is the highest blessing of all, beloved souls. It is what you wish for, your soul's desire and seek. It shall be fulfilled as you pray with earnestness, as you are with God in faith and love, so you are given the blessings. These blessings are not restricted to you. They are available to every soul. You have chosen rightly to receive and to be a part of these blessings. You will walk the road of light and love forevermore. 

Beloved souls, be God's instruments. Seek the truth, the highest of truth. Live a life that reflects this and is truly in alignment with God's Will and God's Truth, the Truth of Love. All will be well, beloved souls. No matter what may come, you will be in the grace and blessings of God. 

God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend Jesus and I love you. Each of you is my friend, is my brother, my sister. Each of you I walk with, shall continue to pray with you and be with you. As you are in need, so I shall answer your call. I shall be with you in light. I shall affirm with you the truth of God's Love, the Christ spirit blessed and abundant in your life. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you in the glory of His Love. I shall be with you always. God bless you.
