Bless you, beloved souls, it is your teacher, Augustine. It is good that you come together to pray as you do, to take time out of your day to be together, and together you are with God. How this nourishes your soul and increases your light as you seek the great gift of His Love, so your souls expand and are benefitting each and every time you pray in this way. 

Make your life a prayer, beloved souls. When your life is a prayer and you open that channel to God from your soul to His, you ask to be used as His instruments in the world and you seek to be uplifted and you seek for the highest of blessings and to be the highest of channels for His Love, then great light is within you and with you. For you aspire toward all that which is of God. You aspire for your souls to be in alignment with God and you seek the ways and means of doing so.

Beloved children, I know each of you have your impediments to God. Each of you have your impediments to yourself and to life. This is part of this unfortunate condition of Earth, but you may overcome these things in prayer, you may overcome yourselves in prayer and the challenging conditions of Earth in prayer. For it is prayer to your Heavenly Father that brings about the healing, the upliftment and the inflowing of God’s Love as you ask for it and receive it. Truly, nothing can hold you from God. For within you is a deep desire, a deep yearning for God. Who can take that from you? Who can affect that yearning? No one, no one can. For this is a sacred relationship between you and God, your soul and God’s great Soul. Thus, no matter what may be in your world or what may be the circumstances in your life, this cannot be taken away. It is yours forever. It is yours to be in that condition of light, harmony and love at all times. 

As this condition builds, as you continue to slough off the earthly conditions, the judgements, the pain and the frustrations and difficulties, you find beyond that, deep joy so that you are in light, harmony and peace. No one can take this from you. It merely is that you allow it to interfere. Yet with free will, determination and application, you may guard yourselves against these obstructions and distractions. It is for you to apply yourself in truth. To truly be that channel of love that you wish to be, to discipline yourselves in such a way that even those obstructions of your mind may not play their part, may not have their power to obstruct you from God. When you feel these conditions burdening you, turn to prayer. Seek out God’s blessings. Seek out the upliftment from your Heavenly Father. You will find the answer to that prayer, given you are sincere and truly desire the healing, the upliftment and the peace that will come. It requires the intensity of your yearning and desire.
You understand this, beloved and beautiful children of God, students of truth. You know that I speak the truth. You have felt the power of God’s Touch upon you. You have felt the transformational blessing of His Love. You know that what I say is true and a powerful truth and I say it once again. Do not allow any condition of the material, of your mind, of all that is of the human condition to keep you from God. For it is only God that is with you and will bless you. It is not the subject of human will that is around you and influencing you. Even spirits cannot do this unless you allow it. 

Those parts of you that are obstructed by fear and doubt, by pain, by material desire, desires of the flesh, these things you may entertain. These things you may put  forward so that God is not primary. Rather, God becomes secondary in your life. I tell you, when you enter into the halls of spirit, you will realise that you have cheated yourself from a great boon of blessings by being passive, by allowing those parts of you that you think are predominant and strong to influence your choices and to guide you away from God. 

You must realise the responsibility that you carry, beloved souls. You must see the patterns and reactions that you have to situations that are not altogether pleasant or agreeable to you. Rather than fight them and push against them, do not allow these things to impede your prayers and your thoughts. Rather, be free in the grace of God and these impediments and patterns will drift away like smoke in the wind. They are not important. They are not necessary. For you know the way to harmony. You have found your way to harmony. You have found your way to God and you have found your way to peace. Choose these things over those conditions that do not bring you to God, nor do they engender peace within you. 

Be strong, beloveds, strong and in faith, strong and in love, strong and with God. Those things that vex you and are part of life will no longer do so. Then you will know the freedom, the joy, the peace, the wisdom, the love that comes with God’s Touch which is available to you at any time, at every moment of your existence. God does not hold back. God gives freely and abundantly. I urge you to avail yourselves to God’s abundant Love for you and all the blessings that come with that Love and to be in the light, beloved souls, to truly be in the light. 

May you be blessed with great and deep peace, with expansive love that abundantly enters your soul and brings you closer to your Heavenly Father. In all of these blessings you will know your true selves, your soul expanded, fulfilled, transformed and blessed and the Truth of God’s Love and the wonderment of God’s Touch. It all comes to those who seek earnestly, to those who make that effort to lift themselves up beyond the earthly condition, beyond the mindful impediments, beyond all those conditions that hold you to the Earth. 

May you be free, beloveds, free in love. May you be joyful, joyful in love. I am your teacher, Augustine and I love you so. My beautiful students, continue on that trek upward to the highest, to the great light that is waiting for you, to the abundant love that is always available to you. God bless you. Your teacher, Augustine, loves you dearly. God bless you.
