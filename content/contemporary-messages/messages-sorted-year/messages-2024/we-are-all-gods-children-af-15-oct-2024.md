Bless you, beloved souls. I am Mary. I come to join you and your family as you pray together for the great truth that has endured since the coming of my son. I am grateful that you continue to espouse the truth in the world and to live the truth.

All of my family, my children, are in the Celestial Kingdom. My hope is that all of your families will enter into the Kingdom of God and His love. For God embraces all and wishes for all His children to enter into this Kingdom of Love so that they may grow and progress for all eternity.

In that way, my children and I have just begun the journey. For all the time we have spent in the Kingdom is but a blink of an eye to eternity. It is for you, my beloved and beautiful children. You just begin. 
It is barely a blink of an eye, but we will all progress forward in the Love and the glory of God.
Each soul shall find its way toward at-onement with God. Be true to your soul's longings, for this is the beginning of the journey. 

This longing that comes from deep within will continue to guide your path and ensure the blessing of God's Love to enter into your soul. My beloveds, my beloveds, you are blessed. You have the grace of God upon you and this blessing spans out amongst your families, your loved ones and those within your circles of love. Continue to be that pillar of light, that  great beacon of love in the world. Those around you, those who are connected to you, those whom you love and who love you, will have the benefit of your prayers and the love you carry, the blessings of God that come to you and through you to others.

So much can happen through one individual who is dedicated to the Truth of God's Love. So much can flow through that individual and touch many others. If they are touched deeply and come to know God's Love, and aspire to receive more, Then they can then become yet another of God's instruments, who will touch another and another, until the whole world is lit with love, light and truth.

This is God's plan, His intention for the world, to come to that place of knowing and receiving, into that place of being Be that light and channel of God's Love and Truth in the world. It starts with one individual. It started with my son, and see how it has grown. So many have sought out this truth, and many more will come in the days and years ahead.

All the time that is available for humanity to make the choice to receive this gift and being the light of truth. We rejoice, beloveds, in the glory and wonderment of God's Love and Truth. We rejoice that there are those upon Earth who know this truth and are dedicated to spreading this truth, to show the way to others.

These things will come in good time, through your dedication, your prayers, your efforts, and in the prayers and efforts of many others. The truth shall spread, and the light shall grow. May we all be in alignment with God's Will so that many will seek out this truth and many will come to know it as the rock and foundation of their lives.

God bless you, my beloveds,  my beautiful children. God bless you and be with you always. The peace that surpasses all understanding is yours, beloveds, for the asking. For God's presence will be known, and His blessings will be within you and in your lives. You are truly loved. You are loved, my beloveds, and I am close. I am Mary, and I love you. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.
