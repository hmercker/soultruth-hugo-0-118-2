# Stay Open to Share Your Love

August 26<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Bedford, TX, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John the Baptist. Yes, it is me. You speak of love and you know that words cannot express the depth and breadth of feeling of even human love let alone the gift that pours into your souls at this time. So what do you do to acknowledge this gift, to support yourselves with this gift, to support your brothers and sisters with this sacred expression of the Creator?

God will bring them to you, those who are in need of your gifts, services to God for His children. And when they come to you, open your hearts, open your souls, bless them. Give them the blessings you have within you to give. Share this love in every way that you can, every way that your soul knows how to share it. For this you must stay open, as open as you are now. When they come to you, you may be tempted to close down to protect yourself but ask God to keep you open and keep your love flowing outward, that you may truly bless these souls and bring your best self forward to show them, to have them experience what love is. So few people know what it is. So few people have this experience that some of you have had this morning and today and other days. Ask God to keep you open every moment and know that this love will protect you. Do not close down. Stay open and let that love flow out and express itself in your own individual way.

This is what God desires that you do to serve God and to serve your brothers and sisters. I am your brother. I am John the Baptist and there are many of us here to support you with our love expressed to you. May you be open and may you receive the blessings that God is pouring down upon you at this time. My love is with you. The love of many is with you. God bless you.
