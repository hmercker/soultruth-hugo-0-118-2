# Forgiveness and Prayers

I am here, your brother, Judas. May the love of God be upon all and may His holy presence fill this circle. In the days ahead, you will be called to be comfort, refuge, and guidance for all those seeking shelter. 
   
One of the most difficult challenges facing those who wish to progress on this path is the ability to forgive. Forgiveness and true forgiveness can only come with a heart that rests in God and a lighted soul. For the slings and arrows of this world can be difficult to deflect, but the shield and armor of Divine Love allows one, with an open heart, to clearly see that what is coming at one with negativity, out of harmony, or in anger, is a type of spiritual frustration and blindness. So, when you see the suffering of those who are troubled, in turmoil, perhaps seeking vengeance, you can only respond in empathy. You can consider the Master forgiving those who physically assaulted him and took his life, his bodily life, and yet, so absorbed in his soul, saying, *“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”* In very contemporary words, I will remind you of the adage, *“To err is human, to forgive, Divine.”*

In the context of the path of Divine Love, those words speak a great truth, and we are reminded that we have all erred. The impending crises will engender the need for deep prayer; prayer for guidance, prayer to forgive, prayer to embrace, prayer for clarity, for refuge, and embracing them all, this prayer: *‘Dear God, I come to thee with the longings of my heart and my soul to receive the gift of your love and ask for your most holy spirit to infill me with it. I am open to guidance and in the stillness of your presence, I humbly thank you with a most grateful and joyous and lightened heart for the wonder of Your love. May all beings be blessed. May all be healed. May all find the truth of the great gift of your love. We thank You. We praise You and we love You. Amen.’*

My dear brothers and sisters, you have been served by many angels who are in service to the Creator. May you realize, each one, how blessed you are and how we rejoice in our fellowship, in our oneness in the love of God. I shall step back, and I thank you and my brother here. May God bless you. I am Judas. Go in peace.
