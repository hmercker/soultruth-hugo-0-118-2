The blessings of the Father’s Love continue to warm your hearts and souls. Beloved friends, I am Phillip and I come to pray with you today. As each of you prays for the great gift of God’s Love, the earnestness of your souls reaching forth to God, eliciting the Laws of Love that bring the Holy Spirit to touch your soul. In this dark world of yours, the clouds part and the light shines through, warming you, encouraging you and blessing you. 

Open your souls wide, beloveds. Open wide to the Touch of God, His Holy Spirit reaching forth, opening, embracing and touching the very depths of your being. Your soul has the capacity to receive this gift for eternity. You begin the journey here on Earth, a very great beginning, indeed, auspicious and powerful. For it will propel you through the spheres of spirit quickly and effectively. In time, you shall enter into the Celestial Kingdom where I and many more reside. Where you will truly know a brotherhood and sisterhood that is overwhelming in joy, awesome in scope, with beauty beyond your ability at this time to acknowledge. 

These are the benefits of your prayers, beloved souls. As you seek out this great gift, the Divine Love, you come upon a path that is tailored just for you. God designates that path as a gift to you. On that path you will be guided and protected. You will be loved and cherished. God will ensure that your soul receives what it desires. The intensity of that desire will determine the intensity of the gift. Open yourselves readily to the great gift that God has to give to you. Be in harmony with His Laws of Love. Seek to live your lives in accordance with these laws. Seek to be truly in alignment with God.

So many in your world do not even acknowledge God. God does not exist in their consciousness. God is not real because they often use the linear deductions of their mind to come to these conclusions. But there is a greater part of you, a part that has the capacity of deep knowing, feeling and understanding that is your soul. Within your soul you cannot possibly deny God. For you came from God, you were created by God and your soul is an image of God.

In this way, as you come to uncover and discover many aspects of your soul, all the beautiful gifts and faculties that are within, so your understanding of God will deepen and increase. The depth of this understanding will bring you to a measure of great faith, great faith in God, great trust, understanding that the true goal of life is to be at-one with God. In this way, you will find the truth. You will find deep fulfilment within and deep joy. 

Focus on your relationship with God, beloved brothers and sisters. In this, the understanding of truth, the understanding of your soul’s longings and the expression of them will increase and strengthen. You will be well upon this road that God has designated for you. Beloved souls, the great gift awaits you. It pours within you. Feel it and know it. May this be a reflection of your life on Earth, a life of light, of service, of love, of creativity, of understanding truth and demonstrating truth in the world.

Beloved, beautiful souls of God, we stand together in this light. As the clouds part and the beams of love flow upon you, around you and into you, be joyful and acknowledge that you have found this great truth and that God has responded to your longings for truth with His Love. With His Love, we progress for eternity. 

God bless you. I am Phillip and I love you, truly love you, all beautiful souls seeking truth. How this fills my heart with joy to see you all, to know you all and to see God’s response to your longing souls. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
