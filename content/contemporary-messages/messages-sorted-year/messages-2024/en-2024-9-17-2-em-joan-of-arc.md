# Open Your Souls Wide to Receive God's Love

September 17<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Wytheville, VA, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

You feel the Touch of God upon your souls, the gentleness of His blessings that pour down upon you at this time. Open fully, completely, that you may be healed, that you may receive all that you are able to receive, all that God wants you to receive to move you forward, to bring you closer, to embrace you, to truly feel His Love as it surrounds you, envelopes you and brings you to a place where few go. Open and allow your souls to benefit from this gift of God’s Love, of God’s care for you. Know that it is always, always available. Open dear sisters and brother. Open widely and move forward in your progression. I am Joan and my love is also with you, each and every one.
