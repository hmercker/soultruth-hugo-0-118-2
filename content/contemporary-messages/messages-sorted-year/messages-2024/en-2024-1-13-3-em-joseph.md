Joseph received by Elizabeth Mack

(I come) to say, I love you. I am Joseph. My son has done much work and continues to do much work to bring about the transformation of souls upon this Earth and you, dear children, you dear children are now a part of that work. With God’s blessings, with my son’s blessings, with all of us who live in the Celestial Heavens blessings, go out into the world and share the good news with all whom you meet. For they are ready to be uplifted, to be brought into the truth of God’s love for them. Their journeys await and yours are just beginning, and you go with our love. Standing behind you and next to you and in front of you will be those souls who can best help each one of you as you progress along your paths and as you share the light and love that God has bestowed upon you. We are grateful for your participation, and we will be with you. May God bless each and every one. I am Joseph and my love is with each of you. God bless you in your endeavors.
