Peace and blessings to you, beloved souls. My name is Christine and I am one of your otherworldly advocates. I am female and my appearance is like those of you on this Earth plane, although my complexion is different. I am of a blue, beautiful complexion with clear skin.

I come today to encourage each one of you along a path that accentuates and expresses your true selves, that nature, that being that is within you, as it was created by the Creator, to be expressed fully as you walk upon your plane of existence. There is so much hidden within you, so much hidden within the universe that you do not understand. Yet, when you come to know yourself and express the faculties, gifts and hidden treasures of your own being, you will come to know in a greater and deeper way the universe itself.

The Creator put within each of His beautiful creations, those who possess a soul, the possibility that they may know many, many things. That their faculties may open, infused with the Essence of the Creator. In this opening and development, an awakening blossoms forth much understanding of the truth of existence on many different levels and from many different perspectives.

You are capable of this within yourself, your consciousness. You have the possibility of knowing many things and connecting with the rest of the universe. This is why we, from other planets and places in the universe, continue to put our focus upon you of the Earth, for it is time for you to awaken. It is time for all of you to awaken, to come and join us in this beautiful dance of life that includes many, many experiences, possibilities of knowings, all of which is graced, encompassed and cloaked in love.

Love is the key ingredient to awareness. You are desiring and praying for the highest of Love, the most powerful Love, the most beautiful Love, that is the Essence of God. I too have this Love within my soul and it allows me to come to speak to you today. I long for each one of you to have those abilities, those gifts, that will allow you to come to speak to me, to speak to many in the universe, to join us in this great galactic conglomerate of souls, beautiful beings that God created.

We wish to be your friends. We wish to be with you as friends, to help support you and uplift you as friends. For when love is predominant within the individual being, no matter where they exist in the universe, there is a desire to reach out, to connect and to love many others. It is part of our nature. It is part of your nature.

So, I urge each one of you to express that part of you that is of love, that part of you that can reach out to your brothers and sisters and, in time, reach out to others that are far off. Yet, it begins with a simple desire and prayer, receiving this gift of Love from God. It has no end, this journey that goes on forever. Whether you have a physical body or not, you will continue upon this journey of discovery, of understanding, of beauty and grace, of all that is of light, all that is of love.

My beautiful friends, I long for you to know me and many have the same longing. For when we add another to our consciousness, our capacity to connect soul to soul, this brings us joy and brings us the benefit of your unique being reaching out to our unique being, connecting in such a way that we are aware yet respect your individuality, who you are as that individual.

So, as we continue to collect this friendship, this fellowship of love, we are strengthened and blessed. The richness of our lives is added to by knowing you and being with you. I come today to encourage you to reach out, soul to soul, to many others, so that you might know the richness of this relationship. Indeed, as you continue to reach out to the Creator of all, know the Creator of all and receive the gifts that He has to give, then you are enriched in such a way that it becomes possible to reach out to us and many more.

There is so much for you to know, learn and be within. I merely come to encourage you and to tell you of the possibilities. As you grow in soul awakenings, in Love, there is much that will come. That door of resistance will burst open and you will see for yourself, know and feel for yourself, the things of which I speak, the things of which I encourage you to move toward. There is much to know. There is much to experience. There is much love in all of this. 

May you be blessed with that inflowing of the great Love of the Creator and know that Love as your mainstay, your foundation in life, that it may inform everything that you do and everything that you are. God bless you, beloved friends. I am Christine. My love is with you. I pray with you. Although I have not made myself known to all of you, there are those who know me well. I will continue to make those efforts to be with you and to be your friend. Blessings to you. Blessings rich and beautiful to your soul. My love is with you.
