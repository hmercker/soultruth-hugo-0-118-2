# My Love for Each of You is Great

Received by Al Fike 

Friends, I am Mary. I come because my love for you is great. I embrace you, each one, children of God, children of my heart and the hearts of all the angels of Heaven. We wish to embrace each and every child, to uplift, to heal and to show the way to God. 

Can you be that child of God, innocent and open? Can you walk the path of love? You will not stumble because God has you in His grasp. The angel's protect you and show you the way that you may not falter and be diverted from the path. It is for you to be with God. We provide the ways and means that you may do so. You provide the will to walk the path and desire for the gift of His Love. All is put into place, beloved souls, that you may know your Creator. The mysteries will dissolve into love, truth and knowledge if you but seek your beloved Creator and know the way of love. 

I will continue to be with you. You may ask for my presence. You may ask to know that you are loved and how powerful that love is. All this brings a gentleness, a peace to your being. You will not have thoughts of anger or fear or resentment, all manner of human thought that is not in harmony with God. Rather you will know joy, expansion, wisdom and peace. Is this not that which your soul longs for and seeks? Is this not what God means for you to have, each of you, to have this blessing? Put aside your reticence, any skepticism or doubt. Be free in the simplicity and wonderment of the innocent child, open and without any impediments. 

We are here together, beloved souls. Here we are with God. May God bless you, beloveds. I am Mary and I love you. Always and evermore, I shall love you, I shall love you. Precious children of God, I shall love you. God bless you, God bless you all.
