I am George and I will begin for I have much to tell you about your progressions. As you know, a progression is a movement forward. Your soul, in moving forward, is moving closer, closer to the light, the light being emanating from God. As you move closer, as you take on more of this love, more light, you are more alive. You may notice changes within your being regardless of where you are on the path. These changes mean that you have let go of, we will call them “densities” for now, that has made it possible for your soul to shine a little brighter. As your soul shines brighter, so does your countenance. Your mind, of course, may be one of the last things that changes because it is strong, very determined to stay in the place where it always has been. But you will notice changes in your behavior, in your feelings.

Pay attention to those behaviors that you may notice are a little different, different responses (to similar situations.) This is how you know you are progressing. I can tell you, all of us can tell you, you are progressing but you have to see it. So open yourself. Allow yourself to be an objective observer of your behavior, of your feelings. Notice what comes to you and how you respond. You will see it is different in some cases. It is different. Remember you are on a journey, progressing and you will see progress, more and more over time and by time I mean, the more you pray, the more progress you make and over the course of those prayers, if you take a moment to reflect, you will see that you have changed, in small ways at first but then, greater and greater ways.

This is the law, one of many laws, of progression. You go forward. Sometimes it may seem like you are going backwards, but you are not. You are progressing.

I come to tell you this because some of you feel that you have not progressed. But we can see you and each prayer brings you closer and brighter and releases more of the densities. I am George, your brother and I am always available to help you. We are all available to help you. Please call upon us when you pray, when you are in need. Please avail yourself of the blessing God has given to you. For we serve God and we will respond when God asks us to do so. May God bless you.  And, the Master is here to give you a blessing.
