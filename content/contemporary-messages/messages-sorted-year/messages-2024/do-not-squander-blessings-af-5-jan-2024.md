Oh, I see the beautiful birds have come together once more to sing their praises to God.  We come to uplift you, to love you. I am Confucius and I love you. I will bring healing to each one of you and many more who come. I will minister to you all along with those who assist me and other angels who are with you to uplift you and to heal you. 

Our fervent desire is that when you are uplifted, as you will be and are at this moment, that you do not squander the light when you go out into the world, but keep it close to you. Make that choice to be in light always so that when light is given, when you are blessed, it adds to the light that is there, and the light grows. But if you go out into the world, as you do, and this world is not of light, then you squander the light. It sloughs off your being away from you because of choices, because of how you are in the world. Those patterns, habits and choices that you make to be in the world often do not reinforce the light. So we come to you to help to teach you, to help to uplift you, to help you to be in the light always. Not just for the moment, but always in the light, my beloved friends. I know this is difficult, because you live in a difficult place. 

The entire world is a difficult place in which to live. You must be vigilant. You must acknowledge those parts of you that are drawn to conditions that are not of light. Then it is for you to change your behavior, how you are in the world. This has two benefits. A great benefit to yourself,and also a great benefit to those you love and those around you in the world. For they feel the soothing light that is with you. They feel the differences that are a part of you. You become a different individual. Not that you lose your personality. No, I do not mean that this is the case. But that how you behave, what you are drawn to, what you manifest in the world changes as you change. As the light grows within you and around you, you change, beloved souls.  

Sometimes you are not aware, but others around you are aware. When you walk down the road and there are many brothers and sisters that you pass, there can be blessings given as you become God's instruments, channels of light and love in the world. These blessings flow to everyone. Is this not a great goal, a great ambition, to be a light for the world? To walk in the world, always in light? 

My beloved and beautiful friends, we are here to help you become that light. We are here to nurture you and to minister to you so that you may be that light. Not that our efforts are made continuously and constantly, and that you negate them by your behaviour. This is not how God works. God provides for you the opportunity to be in light. He uplifts you to show you what that is. It is for you to adopt the truth, to be the truth in your life, to put aside the conditions that are not of love, to put aside the error, to put aside the thoughts that are not of love. 

Beloved souls, I know we ask much of you, but indeed the world needs to change. The world is lost and it needs those who are willing and strong enough to be that agent of change for many. Are you that agent of change, beloved souls? I know that you think first you must change yourself, and this is true. But as you continue in the process of change and healing, the recalibration of your being in love, light and the Love of God, then you are, by choice, an agent of light. You show others. You are that beautiful being. 

We encourage you, my beautiful, beautiful brothers and sisters, to be the agent for God, to be a change for everyone. This will grow from one to another. As you are a light and you influence others, and if they make that choice, then they will be a light, and they will influence others. So it goes in your world, one candle lighting another and another. It is the way of God. It is the truth of God. The light is love and love is the light. Be that light that shall ignite others. So, we will proceed. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I'm Confucius and I love you. I wish to be a light for you. I wish for you to be a light for yourselves. I wish for you to be a light for others. God bless you. God bless you. May the grace of God touch you deeply, deeply, beloved souls  and uplift you to high, high conditions of love. Flutter forth little birds into the light and be God's beautiful, beautiful creations, all that you can be and all that you are in God's intentions and blessing for you. God bless you. I am Confucius and I love you all. Precious birds, precious souls, I love you all. God bless you.
