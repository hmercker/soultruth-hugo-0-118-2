# Sanctuaries

I come. It is your brother, Judas. I wish to expound a bit more on the subject of prayer, but from the perspective of creating sanctuary. You have heard the term *‘being in the state of grace’*, living and passing into spirit *‘in the state of grace’* often describes one who is free from sin or redeemed of their faults. And while there is some truth to that, being in a state of grace is simply being in the love of God to the degree that all things are seen in harmony. All guidance comes easily. This condition is sanctuary. 
  
When you provide a place, a holy place, as is this circle, where souls can come with open hearts and all the deep longings of their souls for the love of God, this too, is sanctuary. 
    
And then there is physical sanctuary, and of course, most refer to this as places for refugees, those in harm’s way, victims of climate change or abuse or all the things that require one to seek sanctuary and refuge upon the earth. To the extent that humans provide this or give service to others in this way, it is a very beautiful thing. 
  
When those who come in prayer to be in the sanctuary of God’s love wish to create sanctuary, in a communal sense, prayer is also required and the kindness and generosity of those who can provide is most welcome. There are many ways we can assist you in your efforts and we shall, but I wish to get back to the very core of this desire and I will say even if you provide a prayer place in your home or in nature where you can join with others this is sanctuary and the numbers are less important than the intentions. For when you come together, as you do in this circle, there are multitudes in attendance on this side of the veil. 
  
So as things become more intensified on earth, it is wise to pray for sanctuary and be in a state of grace. You have made many alliances in many places, and these will be enormously beneficial in the coming times, for there will be many places established around the world on this earth of yours and all who come in prayer for the love of God will be guided by those of us who delight in being able to assist. When this is done, for the love of God, in the love of God, you bring in help in every area, spiritually, materially, and physically. 
  
We pray that your souls will be transformed to the extent that all are living in grace and when the time comes, for you to be with us, it will be we pray, ’a walk in the park’, and I can assure you, if you can imagine the most beautiful park, you will come up short of the light in realms celestial. 
   
So, pray that you may be free from doubt and concern; pray that you may be changed; pray that you may be one with your Creator, for it is a glorious thing and we are so blessed, so loved. 
    
My dear ones, with all my love and in the love of God, I join you in this prayer. I am your brother in Christ and your celestial friend. I am Judas. Go in the peace of God.
