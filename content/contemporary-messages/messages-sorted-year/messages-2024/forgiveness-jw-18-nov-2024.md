I come in the love of God. I am your brother and friend, Judas. 
   
I promised my brother that I would come today to continue speaking about forgiveness but also the human touch. We have often stressed the importance and encouraged knowing the value of soul over mind, of heart over head, of feeling beyond words, and yet, everyone here knows the comfort of words spoken by a loving soul can bring clarity and ease to the mind and a healing balm to the heart.  

And when the boundaries permit, and trust is present a physical embrace from a loving soul to one in distress can make a huge difference in that soul being able to perceive the love of God and open their hearts. Everyone here also knows what it is like to hold a grudge. And when one, perhaps rightfully so, has an issue with another, feeling perhaps unkindness, betrayal, or even physical harm, all the things that cause one to withdraw from another’s presence, it is difficult to forgo the grudge and to forgive. 

When you pray and you release your heart, every part of it to God, you enable God to open your soul, to fill it with His essence, and the more you forgive and the more you let go and, as you say, expiate these things that you have clung to, the more God can touch you and transform your soul. So, human touch plays a very important role, even holding one’s hand, as a parent does with a child to cross the road to assure them, they are under protection, that touch sends a vibration of calm, of peace, to the child. 

When we, children of God allow the divine touch, the divine embrace as we walk through the world, God holds our hands and the angels accompany us, as I come to this circle and so many. When one feels abandoned, or alone, it is a great service to provide a prayer, words of comfort, and an embrace. On the human level, this is a great gift. Every human being needs a hug, and you see sometimes those who are without companionship, living alone, they often procure an animal, a pet, because it is equally as helpful to be able to hug and to give love as it is to receive it. If this is not possible, allow us to hug you with the embrace of Divine Love. 
    
When you call, as we have stated many times, we come. And lastly, I wish to remind you of a couple of things. One, the unfathomable vastness of God’s Creation and the nearness and ever-present love that knows no distance. The Master loved all and continues to love and teach, and when on earth, he made physical touch a part of his ministry, and that touch, with the presence of the love of God in his soul, healed and comforted, and I can tell you from personal experience, even his look would send heavenly vibrations into one’s soul, into one’s heart. So, you who have been blessed with the great gift, as we approach the season of giving, please give the gift of God’s love, embrace all, forgive all, and forgive yourselves. 
   
You are blessed beyond what you know. We love you. I love you and I thank you. I shall step back and be in this peace. God bless you. I am Judas.
