Blessed are the children who seek their Creator, yearning, desiring that connection and blessing from God. Are we not blessed, my beloved brothers and sisters? I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you today. To be with you, my brethren upon this Earth, to walk with you for a moment and speak to you about God and His Love, the grace of God enveloping us all, the Love of God eager to enter into our souls. I urge you to open your souls wide to a great inflowing of this Love. For it is the key to the Kingdom, the Kingdom of God.

I have taught this for many, many years and shall continue to teach it until that day comes when my ministry is done. I shall be with you upon this journey toward God, for God has given me that great privilege and blessing to lead His children into the Kingdom. I do with every moment. I come to those souls who are yearning and I make whatever effort I can to uplift and inspire them, to help them to see the magnificence of this journey, to inspire them to have the vision and the revelation of how much God loves them. I come to them when I can so that they may know me as their brother. For I walk the path ahead for all of you to follow. I am God’s servant for the journey of truth, a journey of awakening the soul in love. I am your brother and your friend upon that journey. 

Those who wish to follow me will be mightily blessed, and will come to know me as their true brother. They will come to know God as their true creator and one who loves them beyond imagining. They will be liberated by the power of this love, healed, transformed and find themselves within a great upwelling of joy. A joy that comes from the soul that has  found the true source of love. The elixir of love that shall, indeed, feed the soul for eternity. 

My beloveds, each of you have found your way. I honour each one of you in your journey and desire to progress further in the soul and toward God. I walk with you. I am with you and shall be with you for all eternity. Never to be forsaken, but always upheld upon the path of truth. You will not be lost, my beloveds, but found in love and truth. You will not be uncared for, but find your way toward the source of all care and love. You will not be lonely, for God is always there. In His beneficence and caring for you, He assigns angels to be with you. You will not know darkness, but the light of God’s Love shall dispel any darkness. You will not know the pain and anguish of a soul lost, for you will find the joy and truth that comes with His Love. 

We are upon a journey together so magnificent, so bountiful, so rich, so beautiful that His grace shall light our way forever. We are given the keys to the Kingdom. Each and every one of you shall enter therein, provided you continue to seek for and receive the great gift of His Love. As you enter into the Heavens, I shall be there to greet you, to embrace you and to affirm that we are truly family within that beautiful existence of love. Beloved and beautiful children of God, know that what you do, the efforts that you make, and the focus that you have upon this truth, shall lead to rewards unimaginable, and blessings pure, deep and broad. That as you seek the Love of God, all blessings shall come and all that is not of love, shall fall away.

You are truly upon the path, my beloveds. In this, you have my special attention, prayers and love. May God bless you upon these travels and may your choices always be for light and your efforts always be toward God. All else will come in this. All blessings, all opportunities to serve in love shall be given. You, my beloved and beautiful fledgling souls of God, shall become strong and awakened, mature and beautiful in the blessings of the Father’s Love to transform your soul. God bless you, my beloveds. My love is with you always. God is always willing to pour His Love into your soul. Seek it above all else and know it as your true saving grace upon the journey of life. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you.
