Sechelt, BC, Canada

John the Beloved received by Al Fike

...comes on the wings of your prayers, beloveds. I am John, known as John the Beloved, and I come to pray with you. What a gift to come to this earthly plane, unimpeded by the dark conditions of this world. To be with you in this light, this glorious light that comes as you proclaim the Truth of God's Love for each of you.
 
The bell is tolled by your prayers and the longings of your soul. This resonant sound reaches God and brings about the blessing of His Love. Guided to your soul by the Holy Spirit, are you eager, beloveds, to receive, to drink deep of these waters? Do you feel the yearnings of your soul quenched by this blessing, God's hand upon you? Are you uplifted by God's Hand, the blessing of this light, the emanations of the Creator encompassing you and embracing you? For God has heard your prayers.
 
God comes in love. There is no judgment. There is nothing to hold God from you.

Rather, you and God are in embrace. Holy communion, that you may drink deep of these living waters, that you may be fulfilled in the truth. Be open, beloveds, open to His Touch. Open to all that God has to give to you at this very moment. For God is joyed at the opportunity that you have provided to bring His Blessings forth as you comply with the laws of love, the laws of prayer that allow this blessing to manifest, indeed, not only for you, but for the world.
 
For each of you become a channel of light for the world as you elicit the Divine response. Each of you are blessed, but also have the opportunity to be a channel of light in the world. Do so unabashedly, unrestricted, and in accordance and harmony with the laws of love.
 
Be that instrument that God has assigned you to be. God has shown you the way. God has given you all that you require to be that instrument of love, that channel of love. Do so without any reticence, but with deep faith, beloveds, deep faith in all that is provided, all that is of God. It is with you now, beloveds. It is with you now.
 
Love is the force that shall change the world, heal the world, and dissipate the darkness. This is what you have asked to come into your presence and into this world. To bring the power of love forth, that it might change, uphold and embrace all souls in your world and in the world of spirit. You are upheld and needed.
 
God has answered your prayers, and we are now in that holy place of communion with our Heavenly Father. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
 
I am John, and I love you. God bless you in His Love.
