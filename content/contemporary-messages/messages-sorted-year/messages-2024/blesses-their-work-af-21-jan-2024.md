I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to uphold you, especially my beloved brothers in this place. I give you a prophecy that though you may take different directions upon the shores of truth, you shall do so in harmony together and that the light shall grow between you and those who wish to support and be a part of your ministries. Respect one another, beloved souls. 

You, my beloved son (J), shall find your voice and it shall speak the truth with every word. You will find yourself in the midst of those who are seeking yet are challenging. But you will find the words to speak and quell the flames of challenge that come from those who are frightened and fearful. Walk your road, beloved son. Walk your road and be at peace. Though your dear wife does not accept your words, in her heart she knows the truth of them. Be comforted by this, my son, and know that she will follow you into the Celestial Kingdom in time. She shall follow you.

Beloved son (D), you have many gifts and you feel that you are on the verge of discovering and expressing those gifts. This feeling of anticipation is correct. You will find your way swiftly, for all that you have done to this point in your life has led you to that point of discovery and awakening. The discovering and awakening shall come to you in the intensity of your desires and prayers. 

Honour your own soul, beloved son . Honour who you are. Honour your heritage. Honour the Will of God within you and be strong, for you need to be strong, my son. To accomplish what you will, you need to be strong and of good faith. Know that I will walk with you, my son, as you traverse the trials and tribulations of a life that is changed and transformed in love. I will walk with you and I will answer your call when you need me. God bless you. I love you dearly. I love you dearly. Many angels surround you. Many are eager for your continued soul progress and awakening. God bless you.

Beloved son (M), you will continue with your gifts. The wisdom shall come through your lips and be given in accordance to your capacity to share and to be in the world as a light. Do not falter. You will be given the strength and capacity to move in the world and to be God’s instrument. 

The three of you, beloveds, shall become a formidable force and shall travel to many different places to share the good tidings of God’s Love open to all, the blessing of this awakening of the soul. You shall be those instruments. So, gather many to you and many shall follow and be a part of this ministry. May the Father’s Love continue to bless you, beloved souls.
My beloved daughter (P), you have a bright soul. Seek the blessing of God’s Love in a conscious and prayerful way and you will come to recognise how you have built within you a great light that shall awaken into your consciousness and bloom and flower in joy, knowledge, truth and strength. 

God bless you all, beloved souls. God bless you all in His Love. I am with you as you well know and shall continue to be by your side. For it is God’s Love manifest that brings us all together in the harmony of truth and love forevermore. I love you. I truly love you and I am with you, blessed and beautiful souls of Go
