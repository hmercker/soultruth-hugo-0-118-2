I am Bartholomew. Yes, I’m close to you, my daughter (A), and to all of you upon the Caribbean Isles who seek to bring this Truth of God’s Love, this redemptive love to the souls of your brothers and sisters. The Truth is being seeded within you. The Truth is being experienced by each of you as you come together in this Circle of Light. As the Truth flourishes within your being, so the gifts of your soul will indeed manifest and come true into the world, not distorted by a mind seeking control, not blemished by a spirit that is weak, but manifest in the strength, glory and light of your own soul seeking to be God’s channel of love in the world. In this, all other parts of yourself come into alignment in expression and harmony with the Laws of Love, the light within, the love expressing itself through all of you and every part of you.

At the end of this time together, you may feel that you have not accomplished your goals but I say to you my friends, just the few days that you have been together, you have progressed a great deal. Parts of you have been changed, already transformed by truth, by love, by the ministrations of the angels. All of you will have felt the impact of the blessings that are here in this Circle of Light. 

My beloved friends, we come together with the desire to find ways and means of bringing this truth to the world. Some of you are very excited about this prospect. Some of you wonder how you may be a part of such an expansive plan. You will find your way and the expressions of your gifts. Indeed, as God allows His plan to unfold through each of you, you will see how you are part of it, how you may be expressed within it, the beautiful gifts that are within you, applied and manifest through you and received and experienced by others. Follow your heart. Follow your soul. Follow the inspiration that comes from these places and you will come to know the glories and wonderment of being a servant of God.

We give much to each of you, beloved souls. We give much because we see the potential within you. We feel the Will of God working through us for your benefit and we have insights into what may unfold in your life and within the Earth. Have faith, my friends. Have faith in yourselves. Have faith in God’s Will manifested through you. Have faith in the transformation that is happening with each of you and walk in joy. For who else has had this experience together? Who else is living the truth together in this way? 

You are blessed, deeply, beloved souls, blessed beyond measure, blessed in such depth and breadth that it will take you some time to truly appreciate and understand what has been given. You will see how these blessings given will manifest in your life. As they do so, you will look back on this time and realise that God brought each of you into this beautiful circle for a purpose and a reason. That reason and purpose will manifest in a number of years to come. You will find yourself compelled. You will see within you changes. You will feel those changes as powerful blessings and motivations that will guide you along your life’s passage.

My beloved friends, may you be truly blessed in the Love of God and in the wisdom that comes with that love and the joy that is a reflection, an expression of that love in the unique perceptions, understandings and experiences that will be ignited by that love. All is given in love. All shall be proven in love, shall come forth in love, shall be the true expression of God’s Will through you. May you be blessed, my beloved friends. I am Bartholomew and I love you. 

I am with you, dear daughter (A), often and there will be a day when I will speak through you and I will express loving intentions of God, of myself and of you and all those wondrous ways and gifts manifest in the beauty of your soul, dear daughter. A soul that is truly beautiful, a soul that longs to be expressed and to be of use to God. You shall be in even greater measure than you are at this time. It shall come and you will find great joy in this, beloved daughter, great joy in the awakening of expression of your soul in alignment with God’s great soul. Be at peace, dear daughter, and know that you are progressing as God intends. You are discovering as God gives you the ways and means to do so, the great truth of love, the wonderment of God’s creation, the beauty of your own soul. God bless you, beloved, beloved daughter. God bless you.
