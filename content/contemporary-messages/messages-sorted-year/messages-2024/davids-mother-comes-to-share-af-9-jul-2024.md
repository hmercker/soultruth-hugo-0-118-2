# David’s Mother Comes to Share Her Story

I am Grace, the mother of David. I come to tell you my story, how I came to know God when I was young. I did not understand the truths as you know them, to such a degree that you are aware at this time, but I understood enough. I felt my heart, knew my heart and followed my heart into service each and every day that I walked on the Earth. I did so in a way that was loving and effective, serving God in whatever way I could. I was true to myself. I did not put on airs. I did not try to be someone that I was not. Instead, I was myself. I held my head up high. I walked in the world as God’s instrument or channel. As you pray for, so did I in my own way and I was His Instrument in my own way.

I want to encourage each one of you to be a channel for God, an instrument of love. Seeking out ways and means of upholding and supporting others, for this is most important. The world suffers greatly. Who will come to comfort and alleviate pain and show a way out of their pain? It must be you. It has to be you, for you have been given much by the angels. You are continuing to grow in the love. God is equipping you with the ways and means of expressing healing and love, peace and joy. All of these things expressed through an individual is an example. It proclaims the Truth of God and God’s Love for humanity. You must be that instrument for such a light and truth to be in the world.

I have grown and learned much when I entered into the spirit realms not that long ago. I went into a beautiful place and I was happy to have found my way into what I thought at the time was Heaven, but have since learned it is not. It is merely a bright and beautiful stopover towards Heaven. I am making my journey and I am walking along that road of love that you walk along. I am making great progress on that road and I will, indeed, enter into the Celestial Kingdom. Joyfully so, and acknowledge the great Truth of God, that God is love and God shall be love forevermore. I shall be loved by God forevermore and I wish to be an instrument, a channel of that Love forevermore. 

We all trod along the same path, my beloved friends. My path is unique to me and so is yours unique to you. We continue to appreciate, to acknowledge, to confirm and to be a witness for one another as we walk along the path of spiritual salvation, of our souls awakening, finding truth and the power and beauty of love within ourselves, bringing this into the world. I still serve God and I do so in many different ways. I am happy to be with you today, to serve God in a way of sharing with you my story and hopefully uplifting you in the story that is the truth of love.

Each of you can do your part in upholding humanity, upholding that great structure of truth that God has created. Be a pillar of light and truth for God, upholding and also receiving. These things come on the heels of prayer, the manifestation of your own faith, trust and desire to be a light. Be true to yourself, my beloved friends, and you will know the joy that I have known. You will know the service in your own way, but it will be similar to what I have known. For what the world needs is not that complicated. The expression of service may be different, but the needs are the same. The need to be loved, the need to have shelter and food, the need to be safe, the need to be secure.

If you bring love and bring some form of nurturing to another, you do God’s work. In this, you will find fulfilment and joy. In this, when your time comes to pass into spirit, you will be satisfied with the ways and means you have served your Heavenly Father. Be of service, my beloved friends. My beautiful son, be of service and God will provide the ways and the means for you to do so. As you gather the Essence of His Soul into yours, then the power and beauty of that expression, that service for God will be multiplied and multiplied again as you continue to grow in His Love, as you continue to express His Love in all the ways that you can, in all the beauty and all that can be expressed in loving, loving means and ways from you, through you and around you. 

May you be blessed, beautiful friends. I am Grace. I love you and I thank this instrument to be able to speak today. I will continue to support all of you and to love all of you, for this is my service and this is my joy. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you in His Love. I love you, all of you, beautiful souls.
