# Grace Jordan Speaks Truth to Her Son

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Grace Jordan received by Al Fike

You have been drifting along, allowing the winds to take you where it will and now you have come ashore. You have found your way to that place where the ground is firm and the meanings become clear. I have spoken to you many times about the truth, but often you were not listening or you were not motivated to apply these truths. But now as you have come ashore, you are ready. You will find your way in service and the outpouring of love is truly a part of you, truly your being, your soul is awakening to your purpose. I am ever so proud and full of love and joy for you.

My son, my son, you are truly a gift from God. I am truly in awe of what can be from you, through you, within you, the beautiful gifts that you carry, the wonderful soul that shines forth. Yes, it may have taken a while for you to come to these shores of truth but that time was not wasted. You have learned much. You have learned how to be compassionate, how to be still in the grace of God and how to express love in all its beauty and manifestations. Truth, this will grow in you, my son. This will grow in you. You will find your way beyond all the impediments, all the error, all the misinformation that has been so much a part of our culture, our place in the world. You will bring the truth to your brothers and sisters, with strength and clarity, with humility and grace. My beloved son, know that God has you well in hand and you will find your way with every day that passes. You will find your way and come to clarity, come to inner peace, come to joy.

My son, the grace of God is upon you. Be true to what you know and who you are, my beloved son. I am Grace. I love you. I love you.
