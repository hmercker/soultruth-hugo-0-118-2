# Praying Together Brightens the World

February 18<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Beams of Light, Tucson, AZ, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now, brothers and sisters, beloved children of God. I am Joan of Arc. I come with many others to this place of bright lights, whose lights, when together, brighten so much of the world.

I am here with my brothers and sisters from the Celestial Heavens. We bring our love to you, you who are true children of God, you who are blessed with God's Love in your souls. Together, we brighten this world upon which you live. We do so because of the love we have for our Father, whose desire it is to transform this world into one filled with loving souls who honour their Father, who follow His Will and who abide by His Laws. For this would be a beautiful Earth indeed, if this were the case.

You, dear children, you are the ones, together with God and with us, who are creating this kind of an Earth. How important it is for you to gather together so that your souls may be brightened, so that your souls may touch other souls with this Love. Together, this Love increases.

Dear children of the Father, let us pray together for the purpose of receiving God's gift of Divine Love, for the blessing of being God's instrument and for the transformation of the souls upon this Earth. Let us pray together for all those who live upon this Earth. Let your soulsâ€™ desires and longings ascend strongly to the Father. Let us brighten this world.

I am your sister, Joan. I and others will be with you as we pray. May the Father's Love pour into your souls.
