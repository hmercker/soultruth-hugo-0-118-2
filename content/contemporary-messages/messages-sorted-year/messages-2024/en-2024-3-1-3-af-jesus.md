# Honouring Age Old Tradition of Prayer

March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Hawaii, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come. I am Jesus. I come to be with you in prayer. It was like this in my day, groups gathering in prayer, seeking the blessings of the Heavenly Father, seeking knowledge, seeking truth and seeking love. You are today seeking all these things, and I am very pleased that you do so in groups such as this, Circles of Light, blessings abound. You draw us to you, beloveds, because you honour an age-old tradition of prayer, of banding together, of harmonising and honouring one another. This is the way of love. This is the way of God, that you may love and support one another as best you can, offering your gifts and loving support to each other, giving all that is within you to help your brothers and sisters. This is the way of God. This is the way of truth.

Rather than what is so often exhibited in your world, competition, separateness, a lack of love, you come together to refute these things and demonstrate the truth and power of love. As you come together, so you are honouring God, so you are honouring one another, so you are honouring the truth. Indeed, your circles will grow, and the light will grow. This bond that has been created together will last for eternity, my beloved friends. You will last in this great Lattice of Light, truth and love. It is strong. The bonds continue to grow and so do you in light. Each one seeing the other for what they truly are, children of God.

I am well-pleased by your efforts, and I continue to uphold you and support you in this. I see that you will continue to reach out to others, drawing them into Circles of Light, bringing blessings into these circles, bringing great blessings into the world. Continue with your efforts, beloveds. Continue to be God’s instruments. Continue to honour one another with love, to uphold, to encourage and to embrace. This is God’s work, and you continue to fulfil His Desire, His plan, His Will in this regard.

God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. I am Jesus and I love you. You are truly my brothers and sisters as you uphold this age-old tradition of praying together and seeking the Love of God into your hearts and souls. No greater truth can be had than this. Together, you witness for one another what is given and how you grow together in light, love and truth. God bless you. God bless you all in this great truth and great blessing of togetherness, fellowship and love. God bless you.
