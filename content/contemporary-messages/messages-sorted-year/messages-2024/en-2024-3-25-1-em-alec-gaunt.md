Alec Gaunt received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am Alec. My dear sister is reluctant. This is the first time we have spoken through her. She will be fine. I come to thank you in your dedication for maintaining these circles of light almost every night. For the light that these circles provide to the world is maintaining a healthy healing condition which is so much needed, as you know, upon this world.

This circle of light, in particular, has long been established and through the generations has grown, expanded and brightened. Even when I was hosting these circles, great light emanated from them and now as you come together across the miles through the wires, even greater light is brought to the Earth. As you open yourselves to receiving the Father’s love, your lights shine brightly. Be encouraged that the work continues even through the generations. There will be more and more joining in these circles, in this love. I am your brother Alec, and I thank you for listening and for continuing the tradition of praying for God’s Divine love together. God bless you, my cherished ones. May the Father’s love surround you, uplift you and keep you close.

Thank you, dear one, for be brave enough to speak. I am your brother, your mentor and your guide.
