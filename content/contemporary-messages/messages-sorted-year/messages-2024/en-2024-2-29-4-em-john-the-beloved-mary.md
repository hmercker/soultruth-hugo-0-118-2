# Keep Your Eyes Focused Upon God

February 29<sup>th</sup>, 2024

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Beloved & Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

**John:** Yes, I am here. I am John the Beloved. I walk with you each day, children. I talk with you and some of you listen. Some of you know that I am with you. I speak to you today about how short this life upon the Earth is and how beautiful will your homes be when you eventually pass over into the Celestial Heavens. Such love and beauty is present. It is the environment in which we live. This you cannot imagine as you live upon the Earth, which is dark and dour in many ways.

Keep your eyes focused upon God. Keep your thoughts trained upon the love that is always with you within your souls, close by you in the form of your Celestial Angel guides and, most importantly, the Love that rains down upon you from the Source of all love, from the highest heavens, where our Creator resides and watches over all of His children, His beloved children, not only here, but throughout God's universe.

So much love is just waiting to be received by each one of you, just for the asking. Keep yourselves focused on the job at hand, the job of transformation of your soul, from a created soul to a divine soul, from an image of the Father's Soul into the Essence that comes from God. Rejoice, children. Rejoice. No matter what stage you are in, rejoice, for your Father has you, each of you, in His Hands, upholding you, embracing you and loving you. This is the highest and greatest Love and gift that can be attained anywhere in the universe. Trust each one of your brothers and sisters that each one will join with you in the Celestial Heavens, for you have the gift, the key that unlocks the door to be there.

My very best blessings I give to you. My love I give to you. I will be with you as you need me. I will come close and always join you in your prayer and always be beside you to help you. Just ask. May my Father's Love enter deep into your souls and bring you closer and closer to His Soul. I am your brother, John the Beloved. I love you all. God bless you, dear children of God. God bless you.

**Mary:** I am Mary. I come to comfort all of you and each of you, for your prayer requests are such that many are in need of comfort. As you grow in this Love, your heart will fill with compassion for your brothers and sisters who do not have what you have and who will look to you more and more for comfort.

You have this ability. You have this compassion. Together, we will embrace them and lift them up to where they can begin to feel the Love of God and open their souls to receive God's Love for themselves. You are so blessed to be doing this work upon the Earth, where the need is great. You are so blessed to have this Love in your souls that makes you one with all others who also have this Love.

Be about your business knowing that you are doing God's work for God, with God's Love within you, as we here in the Celestial Heavens do our work loving you. God bless you. God bless you, dear children. I am Mary and my heart is full of love for you.
