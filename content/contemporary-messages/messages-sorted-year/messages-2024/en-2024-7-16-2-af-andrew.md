Andrew received by Al Fike

Our beloved Heavenly Father wraps you in His Love and Light. He sends His angels to minister to you. He sends His Holy Spirit to bring the inflowing of His Essence into your soul, provided you pray and ask for this. It is not given just because God loves you. It is given because you are willing to accept His Love and to receive it within your soul. That is the only repository that can accept the Essence of God. God has given you the gift of a soul so that you may receive this blessing, and in receiving this blessing, to awaken to the many potentials and gifts that lie within your soul.

You are being blessed at this moment. Gathered around the hearth of God’s Love, its warmth radiating out to each of you. Gathered in harmony so that you may know all that God wishes to give to you. That you may share this giving, you may share this experience, breathing in deeply the Breath of God, drinking deep the Living Waters of God. Feeling amongst you that sense of fellowship and camaraderie, for you are blessed to have one another. So many walk the lonely path. So many are not aware that there are others. Yet, God has ensured that you will have one another, and that in this Love that you share there is upliftment, comfort and knowing that you are truly loved.

May you be free of the shackles of the human condition. May you find yourself liberated in Love, feeling the joy of a heart expanding in the blessings of God. Knowing the truth within your conscious self so that you may apply this truth to every part of your life. Being free, true and joyful as you are meant to be, as God wishes for you to be. In this, you can be that light that will touch many others. In this, you can be a channel of His Love. Allow the flow of love to be a part of you. Recognise it. Embrace it. Allow it to flow forth as a blessing for others, for in this blessing many will benefit.

Souls will be touched in such a way that they may seek out more and wonder how they may receive more of this gift and blessing. This is where you might add the truth, speak the truth to their lives as you share the wonderment, beauty and power of your journey, your being. The transformation that is taking place, the beauty that is manifest from your soul, the gifts that God may use to touch others, all these things come in the blessings of God’s Love. It is the source of all that is of goodness, light, and harmony. This Love, this Love is your rock foundation. This Love is the key to all that you desire, all that your souls long for. It is given abundantly, freely and in love.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. I am Andrew and I love you. I am with you often as we seek out the great benediction from God’s Soul to yours. We will continue this journey, beloved children of God. We are His servants, His children, His finest of creations.

God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls. In the power and glory of Love, you shall know your true selves and find your way to at-onement with your Creator. God bless you. God bless you.
