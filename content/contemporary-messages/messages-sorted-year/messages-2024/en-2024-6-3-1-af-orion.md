# Lesson on Faith

June 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Orion received by Al Fike

You travel the road, my friends. This is Orion. This road that is done and accomplished through faith rather than insight, perception. Often you know not where you are going, what is around the corner, what is waiting for you. Still, you trudge along knowing that this is the direction you must go in. This is where you must apply yourselves and step forward day by day. Indeed, the faith that grows within your soul, that love that shines forth, that hope that is part of your consciousness and your motivation, continues to inspire you and strengthen you. Such is the way of this great gift of Love from the Creator.

Indeed, you aspire toward deeper insight, perception and knowing so that you may see further than that which is your next footfall. I urge you upon that path and desire, to continue to pray for this, for you will be comforted and joyed by deeper knowledge and understanding. You will find peace in this. Until that day comes, and it comes gradually and subtly, you must rely on the strength of faith that you carry, the faith that tells you, *“I am doing God’s Will.”* The faith that says, *“I am journeying along the road of spiritual awakening, of soul understanding, the road toward at-onement with the great Creator of all.”*

Indeed, you have not abandoned that faith, but you continue to strengthen it. Your very presence here is an indication of that strength and that desire to continue on. We will continue to nurture you, uphold you, teach you and love you as you continue to open yourselves to all that can be given in light, truth and love. We are here with you, my beloved friends. Always, we are here with you and shall continue to do so for as long as you wish, as long as you desire. As long as you have faith in the journey that you are taking, we will be with you.

My beloved friends, do not be discouraged by a lack of insight and understanding. Rather, have faith that all will come in good time, when you are ready, when you are capable of understanding beyond that which is merely of the material mind and those faint glimmers of soulful awareness. You must encourage that awareness of the soul, nurture it, believe in it and open yourself to it. In this way, the insight that you desire will come and you will see your way through without speculation and imagination. Where instead, there will be insight and truth. Come to the fountainhead of truth, my friends. Come to the fountainhead of love and all will come with this effort to be in alignment with universal truth, Divine Truth, soulful truth.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion and I love you. I walk with you and I, in my own way, help you to see and understand, to grow in your faith. I am with you. Your friend, indeed. Blessings to you, blessings of love
