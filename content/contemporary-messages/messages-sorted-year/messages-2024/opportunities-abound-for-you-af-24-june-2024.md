Friends, I am your teacher, Augustine. Each of you has a deep purpose in your life. As you gather today, you are affirming that destiny and purpose that is coming into your life. God continues to nurture you and God has guided you through many trials and tribulations, through many circumstances and situations in your life. As you have passed those tests, as you have come to realise the power of your own soul, as you have come to know your Creator, your Heavenly Father, so you are ready to come to know at least a portion of your purpose, your journey toward service, toward awakening, toward the understanding truly and deeply of your own soul in relationship with your Creator. For if you are to be Godâ€™s instruments, you must know yourself, that inner self that is so vital, precious and beautiful, and to put aside the clutter and the conditions of your mind so to know the freedom and expansiveness of your soul.

As you come to this realisation and awareness of your true being, then you will come to know the ways and means of developing your gifts, for your gifts reside within your soul. Your gifts are waiting for you to discover them. Your gifts are poised to be awakened and thus, this is our purpose and our effort together. You with your compatriots working together, supporting one another, seeking to reflect as you are with one another, the progress you have made and the insights that come, the experiences of your soul and reflecting the light of your soul toward one another. This is but one layer, one aspect of what we are doing here together. Indeed, there are many more layers.

Your angel friends crowd closely around you, surrounding you and we are here to help you open your eyes, to awaken your souls, to acknowledge that which resides within you. Together we pray to be with our Heavenly Father and receive the great inflowing of His Essence, this powerful and beautiful blessing that shall open the doors to many gifts, making possible many outcomes and expressions of your soul which is seeking to serve God, to love God, seeking to serve one another, to love one another, seeking to serve humanity and to love your brothers and sisters. 

You are embarking upon a wondrous journey. Take full advantage of what will be presented to you as opportunities to grow in insight, perception, understanding and love. As you do so, you will be surprised at what will unfold. You will be delighted and at times you may be shocked, but the journey will be well worth your time and effort if you are willing to step forward bravely, innocently and committedly toward that which is set before you, this bounty, this feast of love, of guidance, of blessings, of openings. So much is given. You reside in a place that, at this moment, is unlike any other upon this earthly plane, a place that has been richly blessed and prepared. 

The table is set, my beloved friends. The table is set for each one of you. Feast upon what is provided. There are no limitations here. There is merely the opportunity to seek and grow, understand and awaken. All of that is dependent upon you and your choices, your approach and your attitudes. Do not be fearful, but joyful. Do not judge, but love. Do not fall into old patterns of beliefs about yourself. Rather, understand that in this you are being born again into the truth, the wonderment of a soul redeemed by the Love of God. God bless you, my beloved students. 

May you truly come to know all that resides within, even those difficult insights are a blessing, and that which is joyful and wondrous shall be bestowed upon you readily and powerfully. God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine and my love is with you, my dear and beloved students. My love is with you all. God bless you. God bless you.
