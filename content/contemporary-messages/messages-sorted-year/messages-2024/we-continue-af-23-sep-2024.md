# We Continue to do All We Can to Help You

September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

On the Road Again, U.S.A

Received by Al Fike 

I come to speak. I am Christine. We have been working diligently to help balance your systems, your bodies and help bring greater harmony amongst you. To bring light, lots of light. To envelope you in light. To help bring the Divine Love and Light to you so that you are fed spiritually. As you have said, dear daughter, the spiritual component of your travels has been uplifting and filled with light. Your bodies, of course, are subject to the conditions of this Earth and subject to your own free will choices. So we can do what we are able to assist you, but often this is counterproductive because of the choices that you make and the situation that you are in. 

We understand how difficult it is to balance diet in this situation. We are not judging you, my friends, but merely to say that there are limitations to our ministrations. Yet you continue to be uplifted and upheld in love, in light, in healing and blessings. We are very happy indeed to be with you, especially our dear son who is developing rapidly and is having many experiences as a result. Indeed there is much work to do still for all of you to bring you into that alignment that is powerful, beautiful and effective. We will continue to do our work. We will continue to love you, as will many who accompany you on your journey. 

Dear daughter, you must allow the energetic blocks to be released. In this way, these fits of coughing will decrease and decrease until they are gone. Pray for this. I know that you have and we are working to help you. It is important that you see within you the sources of those blockages and allow God, the angels and us to work to release them. It is more than just a physical problem. There are emotional components and spiritual components that are a part of this. Indeed as you travel and are a part of this team, this grouping, it is a great opportunity for deep healing and deep release of conditions. So this is a blessing, dear daughter. I know it does not seem as such, but it is a blessing. You will overcome these conditions and they will be gone permanently. All vestiges of these dark conditions will be released. 

The human body, spirit and soul are very complex things. Often you are unaware of those elements that are not in harmony and those conditions that are not of light. We see all. We have the soul perceptions to do so. So this is where we focus our time and our efforts upon each one of you, helping you to release these conditions and to purify further, both physically and spiritually. Thus there are times when you may feel uncomfortable or restless or even have difficulty sleeping, but this is part of the cleansing process that continues to be a part of your journey together. 

There are many levels, many elements of blessings, gifts and awakenings that are a part of this journey. Though you see yourselves as servants for others and this is a very good attitude, you are also being servants for one another and servants of God, being refreshed and cleansed, awakened in many ways. The bonding that you have together and the chemistry that you share together is powerful and can bring many healing expressions to each of you. Each of you is blessed and each of you is unique. Thus you have gifts and capacities that you can share with one another. You have chemistry that you can share with one another and you have thoughts that you can share with one another. All of these things are enhanced by the Divine Touch upon each of you.

So it is a great blessing indeed, probably the greatest of blessings that you are together for this period of time and that you continue to benefit from what takes place while you are together. You see, Godâ€™s plans are multidimensional and very layered indeed, so it is difficult for you to see even one layer of this plan. We see all the layers and we see all the opportunities that are set before us. We work to fulfil what God has presented as opportunities, as possibilities for many blessings. It is challenging for us to work with you on Earth, for the conditions are difficult and they are very varied and complex. So it keeps us on our toes as you would say. There are challenges for us as well, but we overcome these challenges as do you, my friends. 

You are blessed, truly blessed to have one another. To be together in this way and to be with God in the way that your souls know to be with God, to be open to your angel friends and your stellar friends, the bright spirits, all who help, all who gather around you seeking to assist you and uphold you. How very blessed you are, my beloved friends, how very blessed indeed. Few are blessed like you are because few are open as you are. We will continue in our efforts. Each day, each moment of each day is a precious blessing and opens a multitude of opportunities for greater development, for purification, for assistance in your health and well-being. Absorb all that can be given. Be open to all that is given and you will be strengthened and for the better when you end this time and return to your homes. 

Blessings to you, my friends. I am Christine and I love you. I honour you. I have deep respect for you, for you face many challenges and yet you persist, you love and you give in love. God bless you and may you be upheld always in the truth of love, in the light of love, in the joy of love. God bless you. God bless you.
