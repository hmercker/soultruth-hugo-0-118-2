# Do Not Tarry as You Listen To God’s Calling

March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Hawaii, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

...beautiful and unique to each one of you. For each of you are unique. Each of you has your own language, your own capacity and way of communicating with God. Though your prayers are beautiful, and they reflect this unique perspective and expression, they are only the surface of what is truly within you, that soul that longs and desires to be with God. A soul that was with God in the beginning, then separated into the flesh and longing evermore to be at one.

God has set the soul upon a journey of individuation, of discovering its own true self, potentials, expressions and gifts, all these things that God has put within the soul. That soul cannot truly express these things without the journey of incarnation and then upon the spirit planes. It is God's hope that they will enter the Celestial Kingdom. In this way finding at-onement with God. Each of you are on that journey. Each of you longs within for at-onement with God.

You have answered that longing with prayer and dedication to receiving the great gift of His Love, so that you are ensured a place within the Celestial Kingdom. It shall be in time as you continue to grow and be transformed by the great Love. You will find yourself a changed person. Those things that were applied upon you in childhood and in your life’s, experience will be transformed and transmuted into that which is in harmony with God's Love and the Laws of Love.

Do not tarry within the earthly plane and think that there is much time for you to find God. In fact, the time is short upon this earthly plane. You well know that the thoughts, deeds and conditions that you carry in your daily life determine where you may go upon the spirit planes when it is time for your demise upon this plane. For many of you the time is indeed short. You must apply yourselves with great desire and effort to be with God. As you grow in this love, as you inch closer to God, so your light grows. Your capacity to love grows. Your understanding of truth grows. These benefits are all for you and your life. They are deep and abiding benefits that will not dissipate in time but grow and become a permanent aspect of who you are.

There is another great benefit. As a light, you influence the world. As a beautiful light for God, you become His instruments. All around you benefit from your efforts, as well as your own personal benefits. Do not forego the opportunities that God has laid before you, that which God gives to you abundantly. His true desire is that you will be a light. That you will live in accordance with His Laws of Love, that you will truly be free from the burdens of the earthly condition and live your life as an expression of love.

Yes, my beloved and beautiful friends, you have been given a great gift, a great truth. It is for you to live it fully. Not in a way that is an interpretation of your mind's perspective, but in a way that is a true perception of the soul, that unique part of yourself that can see beyond those distorted conditions of the earthly plane. Be clear and true to what God has created within you and the potentials that God has given you as a soul seeking its realisation and awakening in love.

Do not tarry, my friends. Live, truly live in the light of truth. Truly express yourself in the ways of truth and love. Ask each day to be God's instruments in the world. You are very needed, indeed. Very needed, for many cry out and many are lost. This earthly plane continues to be darkened by the human condition multiplied by millions upon millions of souls, expressing themselves in ways that are contrary to their true nature, their true being. Who will be that light, that example? Who will speak the truth? Who will love? If not you, then who will do this? I urge you, my beloved brothers and sisters, to walk in the way of love and truth. In this way you become my disciples. In this way you are a light for God. In this way you speak the truth.

My beloveds, I am your brother and friend, Jesus and I love you. I truly love you. I walk with you as you walk with me. We walk together towards at-onement with God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you on the journey. Awaken, each day to an opportunity to awaken further, to shine brighter, to love more deeply, to accept and embrace your brothers and sisters. God bless you, beloveds. I love you. God bless you.
