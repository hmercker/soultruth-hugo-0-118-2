Liverpool, NY, USA

George Stokes, Timothy & Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, your old friend, **George** and I will speak briefly. You, and I speak to all in this circle, those of you upon the screen as well, have come far in these last few months. Your progression is well underway. You are in keeping with God’s will as you progress towards Him. Keep up your courage. Continue as you have been, knowing that God’s Love is with you, in you, surrounding you, protecting you, uplifting you. All you need do is be open to this Love and as this Love comes in, you will feel a difference. You may not feel it consciously, but your soul knows. So, stay open, dear children. Pray. Pray for protection. Pray for the Love. Pray for your brothers and sisters. And continue walking this blessed, sacred path. I am George Stokes, and I bring to you your friend who has come before, Timothy.

Hi! I’m back (**Timothy**). I was in the 5th sphere before, and I am happy to share with you that I have progressed, and I am moving towards the 7th sphere where I will be closer to God than ever before. It has been an exciting journey and required so much work on my part but I, like you, am reaping the benefits of progressing in this love. I can never go back to being how I was and what I was before, and I encourage you all to continue in your soul development. The prize that awaits all of us is entrance into the Celestial Heavens where Love is everywhere. Thank you for letting me speak. I’m your brother in this Divine Love. I’m Timothy. God bless you and thank you, Elizabeth.

I am Joan. Yes, **Joan of Arc** and what our good friend Timothy says is true. We can never go back to the limited, unhappy existence that we had before. We choose to love our Father to the greatest extent possible. As much as our souls can contain of His Love is how much we Love Him and yet, we seek for more Love, now and always. This is the path of Divine Love. Love, happiness, glory to our Father, a glorious environment in which to live. So much beauty is available because of this love. And we, in the Celestial Heavens, all encourage you, each and every one of you to come forward on your path, to step up to every opportunity to receive this Love and to receive it as deeply and committedly as you possibly can. For therein lies the riches that await you.

May God bless you. May my Father pour down His Love, blessings, grace, truth, healings upon you all. And those upon the Earth, my love is with you. God bless you. I am Joan of Arc.
