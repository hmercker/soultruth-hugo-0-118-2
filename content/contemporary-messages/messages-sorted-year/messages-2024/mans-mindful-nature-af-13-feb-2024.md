Blessings and greetings to you, my beloved friends. I am Orion. There is a great tendency on your earthly plane to categorise and to restrict and limit with definitions, words and thoughts, all the aspects of your life, putting walls around these things so that they are contained and understandable by the mental faculties that you possess. It is a system and a way of being in the world that is eons old and so well established that I think you do not even recognise the process which you engage in this way. For it is second nature to you. Making things into understandable concepts and paradigms is the way of your world. Yet, we entice you into a different way of being and perceiving.

The soul seeks to expand, to transgress the normal barriers and boundaries that the mind creates. How else can the soul know God -  this expansive Being that knows no limitations or boundaries? Yet he has given each of you and all of us the capacity to understand Him, to know Him and to be in communion with Him. You read books. You communicate amongst yourselves. You listen and read the transcripts of messages that talk all about a relationship with God. Yet all these things are somewhat contradictory to the true act of communion. For it requires no thought, no definition. It merely requires your expansive acceptance, yearning and desire to be with God, and to understand truly what God is. The faculties of the soul, when ignited by God’s Love, are limitless and are not subject to restrictions and definitions. Though you may try to share some experience you have had within your soul, you well know that words are inadequate. Feelings are more definitive in terms of this experience. Yet how do you convey a feeling other than some loose definition?

How do you allow your soul to truly take precedence in your consciousness, negating the mind’s desire to define and restrict, allowing yourself to open wide, to receive the great gift of God’s Love and to commune with the Source of that gift and you intermingling in your consciousness so that an intimacy like none other can be formed and realised. In this way the material mind may acknowledge and participate. In truth, it is a very minor player in this experience. The soul is paramount, it is the leader and definer of the experience.

We continue to encourage you to be awake within your soul, to allow the power of God’s Love to dominate your consciousness, especially in prayer so that these experiences, undefinable, unrestricted, may be yours. That deep Touch of God may define and anchor that experience for you, that you may shift from mindful consciousness to soul awareness and expansiveness, so that you are set free and journey into the reality of God, knowing His gentle and loving Touch, knowing the power of His Love and knowing the awakening that comes as His gentle hand infuses within your vulnerable soul the great blessing of His Love. 

These things come in prayer, in yearning, in practice, in effort. We encourage you along this road. I know many of you often do not feel and recognise this connection as palpable and powerful. It is often subtle and difficult to truly understand. In this way you begin to know and realise the limitations that you have set for yourself that your mind continues to dominate. That you continue to allow this domination to be your centerpoint of consciousness. You must shift and allow this other place, that deep and hidden place of the soul to come to the fore, to be acknowledged and not limited in its expression and experience within you. 

Practice, beloved souls. Practice in ensuring that the mind is not dominant in your prayers, and in your experience with God. God seeps in everywhere, beloved souls. Do you not get insights, impressions, guidance, many things that seep into your consciousness, unexpected and not inhibited by the mind. Yet the mind often rushes in, discounting, filled with disbelief and with the idea that this has been imagined, that this has been fabricated and believing that these things are not real. This is the way of your world. 

Yet you continue to struggle with this very question and issue and we are very pleased that you do so. How else can you rise above and reach beyond the conditions of your mind but through prayer and longing, prayer and longing, seeking out the truth, seeking out that deep part of you, seeking out your true self? These things must come to the fore of your consciousness and they are as they are being strengthened by this gift of Love, given by God. It is in building walls, defining and restricting this Love, instead, allow it to flood in as it comes drop by drop, seeping through the cracks, coming in dribs and drabs. 

My beloved friends, is it not time for you to open to the great inflowing of God’s love, to allow that intense longing that truly does exist within you to be expressed, to be uninhibited, unrestricted. This is the time, beloved souls. For how much time do we truly have for you to realise these things that I speak of? You may be stuck in the habits and paradigms of your own making forever, if you wish this. Or you may free yourself and be truly that child of God which is what your soul wishes, and we wish for you. This is what God intends for you. Freedom, beloveds, freedom, joy, expansiveness, wonderment, travelling within the universe of God, knowing His Love and Light and blessings, flowing to you with such abundance and clarity, that you would never doubt again. You would never be lost again, but truly be claimed by God. 

May you be blessed, beloved souls, in this way always and forevermore. I love you. I am your friend, Orion and I love you and shall be with you on this journey forever there to encourage, explain, encourage and demonstrate. God bless you, my friends, in the Love of God and all that it brings forevermore.
