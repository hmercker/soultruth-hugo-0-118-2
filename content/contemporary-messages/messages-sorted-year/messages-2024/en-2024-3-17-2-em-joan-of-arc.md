# Say a Little Prayer for Each Person You Encounter

March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Online Prayer Circles, Liverpool, NY, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

â€¦ and I should like to speak about loving. It is easy to love our Heavenly Father, for His Love is so constant, so strong and so ever present. It is easy to love Him and love Him we do, constantly. Yet, loving our brothers and sisters is a little more challenging. Still, this is what we are also meant to do as we progress on this Path of Love.

Dear brothers and sisters who truly love each other, as you go out into the world, for a quick moment, offer a prayer for each soul that you encounter, so that your love for them may grow, so that they may feel this love and so that they may have this experience of being loved, for many in this world do not have that experience.

This is just a little tip to help you to grow in your love for your brothers and sisters in preparation to be of service when they come to you. A little prayer for each soul that you encounter will smooth the way for them and for you to be of service for God, whom you love, and your brothers and sisters upon the Earth, whom you will also love.
