John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

(Be) at one with your soul. I am your brother, John. It is my pleasure to speak through this medium to my brothers and sisters who still walk the Earth in the flesh. God provides us with many expressions of His Love. You come into this Earth plane for the opportunity to become one. You call it individuality, that is an expression of God's Love for your soul.

This Earth, at one time, was a beautiful, exquisite and healthy place where your physical bodies, your material minds, your spirit body and your soul to resid. At one time, all three were one, manifested on the Earth plane. Now, this is not the case. There is a disjointedness among humans upon this Earth, the soul being quiet and not expressed in coincidence with the spirit body and mind, nor with the physical body and mind. Yet, all three are one. Two are an expression of the soul, but there is something else. It is man's unloving expressions that cause the disjointedness.

This is not the way with God. God provides many expressions of Love. Beautiful are the things upon the Earth. They could be even more beautiful and will be more beautiful. It is up to you, each one of you, to let go of those things which keep your own individual disjointed. By allowing God's Love to flow into your souls in greater and greater abundance, uniting those parts so that, once again, there will be expressions of love of your soul expressed as your spirit and expressed as your body, expressed as one.

We are here to help you. The stellar friends are here to help you. God's Love will transform you and bring you to that place, that condition of oneness within yourselves and oneness with our Father. All will be expressed in accordance with our Father's Will and Love for each one of you. Such a happy day this will be. I look forward to the time when my soul can be fully expressed with my soulmate, in the Love of God.

I am John Hughes. I love all of you with the Love of God from my soul. I thank you for allowing me to speak about the beauty that will be forthcoming as a result of the expression of your Divine Love upon this Earth. I thank you. May God bless you continuously, as He is now doing with His Love raining down upon you. God bless you. My love is with you and always will be.
