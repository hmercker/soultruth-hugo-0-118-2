May God’s love be upon you all. Let your inner eye look heavenward as you open your hearts to the great infilling of the Creator’s love. As you walk this earth, remember that all things in creation are alive, all things are vibrating in love. 
  
It is near the time where there is a celebration in many countries called Father’s Day. Of course, every day is Father’s Day, or is Mother’s Day, but we set aside certain days to celebrate, to honor, and to be in prayerful at-one-ment, whether in memory or in the present. 
 
For me, in my time, I would often go barefoot and look up to the heavens, most especially in the evening to the sky filled with stars and in wonderment for my life, my family, my children. I would thank the Creator with all my heart. I did not know of receiving the love of God until after my son had given his life, resurrected, and shown the glory of a transformed soul to me and many others. This was a turning point and those of you who have felt the grandeur and glory of God’s love have experienced this turning.  

In my tradition, we had an expression of turning from Ecclesiastes, which a version of this turning from scripture, and as my brother here knows, this became a song. To every season, turn, turn, turn. And yet this greater turning towards the love of God of each soul is an event unparalleled and therefore, on this day called Father’s Day, open your arms and your hearts to the heavens, your feet planted firmly upon the earth, and say a prayer. Say a prayer for healing, a prayer for peace, a prayer for all the children of the earth, and above all, a prayer that the great love of God may turn this world into light from darkness. 
  
The Father’s love for all His children is something humans often forget and yet, when one is in the love of the Father, the soul knows. The soul can feel the greatness, the oneness, and the tenderness that is a gift from God, in His love. So, I celebrate this with you, myself a father of eight children, loving them all, all of them in the celestial realms now. We are all followers of my son and we all worship and pray to the one God, the Creator of all. May each one here receive this blessing in this moment and walking forward into God’s light, His healing, His embrace. Let us be grateful and humbled and joyful. With all my love and blessings, I am your brother in Christ. I am Joseph.
