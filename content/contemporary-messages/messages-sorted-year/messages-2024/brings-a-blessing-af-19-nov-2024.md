I am with you, beloveds. I am Mary. I come to pray with you and to be with you, beloved children of God. How loved you are. How God's Love continues to pour, in all its abundance and light and glory, upon each one of you and upon the many who are connected to you. This beautiful gathering of souls that seeks for the highest of truths, seeks for the greatest of love. You are blessed and you shall be blessed, beloveds.

I embrace each one of you. I tell you, *“I love you so”* and you are a soul worthy of love. Each of you, each soul, is worthy of love. Allow God to embrace you, beloveds. Allow all the gifts, the bounteous blessings, to pour upon you and within you, to be a channel of love so that His Love may flow through you, to be a harbinger of peace so that His blessings may touch others, to be a light, so that when you speak you may speak the truth, to be true to your own soul so that you may be that example for many.

The world is in turmoil. Each day that turmoil increases. Each day the conditions worsen. Each day more souls are feeling lost and afraid, with deep concern for their well-being, the future and the future of their children. They need the comfort of God's Touch. Pray for this world of yours, my beloveds. Pray for all who are in need. Whether they understand or realise this, every soul is in need of God. Every soul needs your prayers, for the world is a harsh place. What gives comfort but the warmth of God's Love, the peace that comes with this Love and the upliftment that God gives to His children, sending His angels to be with you all. My beloveds, pray that many will feel the upliftment, the peace and the comfort, that they may know some respite from these dreadful conditions. That they may understand that God is there to protect, uphold and uplift. 

You come to this fountainhead of love, drinking of its waters, because you know of this. You know the power of God's Love, the feeling and the comfort of God's Love. So, you continue to drink of these waters, to seek out the comfort and to be immersed in the peace that passes all understanding. We rise up into that Hall of Peace together, beloveds. We shall know respite. We shall know peace as we open ourselves to what God has to give. Open wide, beloveds. Open wide and know that you are loved.

God bless you. I am Mary and I love you always and evermore. I love you and will love you. We are all children of God. God bless you, beloveds, and keep you in His Love always. I love you.
