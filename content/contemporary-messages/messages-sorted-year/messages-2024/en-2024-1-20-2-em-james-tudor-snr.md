# I Stand With You and I am Here for You

January 20<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Barbados Retreat , Barbados

James Tudor Snr received by Elizabeth Mack

Oh, Father, I ask that You bless these souls, these not only Your children but Your workers upon this Earth. May they be strong in their knowledge of You. May they feel that Love, that glorious Love, that is that which moves them forward and onward.

I am James Tudor. I am so proud of my kinsmen. My proverbial heart, my soul lightens with the love and the joy that I have amongst you this day and these days together. I see what can be, because you have Love in your souls. You have this Divine Love that moves mountains of ignorance, mountains of disharmony and mountains of lack of love in all its forms.

This is what you have inside of you. This is what you are, this Love and all of its attributes. I stand with you and I am here for you. You are messengers of this Love and messengers of this Truth. You have been anointed as such and, therefore, this is the path you will walk, now and always.

God bless you. God bless you, my kinsmen and women. God bless you. I am your brother in the truest sense. I am a light by which you can travel and become more and more of your own lights. I am my Father's child, as are you. I am James Tudor of this island and I love you all dearly, so, so dearly.

May God bless you. May you connect with our Father throughout each day and stay connected, that you may find your way. I love you and may the Father bless you, each and every one. God bless you.
