…within your soul that you desire and God desires truly become a part of you. My beloved friends, I am Orion. For as these changes take place, as the light grows within your soul, as God continues to strengthen you with His Love, so the gifts of your soul emerge, so the beauty of your light grows stronger, so all that which you desire to be and to express comes into harmony with all that which God desires for you to express.

In this way, you come into alignment with God. You come into alignment with God’s plan and with the Truth of His Love, the laws that pertain to this Love. Though you approach these things with a mind full of questions and projections, ideas, the soul knows its own way to God. It will not falter. In time you will give way from these mindful and factitious thoughts to that which is of the soul and of God’s Will. Letting go of what you call ego is required, allowing that humble, beautiful, sensitive fluid part of you that is your soul to take precedence in motivations, thoughts and deeds that bring you along the spiritual path.

Take good counsel with your soul, my friends. For that is where the wisdom lies. Nothing can be accomplished without this alignment between your mental and spiritual consciousness. It is key, it is crucial. In doing so you create a powerful alliance within you, one that will overcome all obstacles toward light and purification, transformation. Consciousness is everything, my dear friends. Without your awareness, your focus, focusing of your desires and your thoughts towards this end goal of soul merging and integrating with your consciousness, then you will remain steadfast and stuck within the mindful conditions that you carry.

You will accomplish some things and you will have a measure of success, but you will not accomplish those deeper and higher intentions that God has for you. For you are not able, without this consciousness flourishing within you, to understand, to receive, to perceive and to act upon the guidance, the insights and the powerful capacity to love that will come with this shift of consciousness, this integration that must take place.

Be aware, my beloved friends, of that which is of the soul. It is within your grasp. It is not that difficult, but it requires you to lay down your mental concerns and distractions, to repattern your thinking and the way in which you come to know your inner self. These things require your efforts, the exertion even of your mind to lay a clear course toward the soul to be free of the impediments, to be true to your soul’s longings and to recognise them, to have the wisdom and discernment to know what is what, what form of consciousness you are inhabiting and even what amalgam of consciousness that you are creating within your minds and your conscious self. 

It takes work. Yet this is an important task. I do not reiterate these things because it is a casual and unimportant effort. It is of the utmost importance. It requires something within you that must stir the desire, the effort and the realisation of fulfilling this goal. You will not come to this in such a way as flipping a switch from one to the other. It comes with gradual practice and effort. It comes as you understand and discern between the two states of consciousness. It comes as you accept and embrace that which is of your soul. It is time to do so, my friends. Time is of the essence. If you are to be the instruments that you have prayed to be, if you are to demonstrate the gifts that you seek to have and to express, then this is the crucial step. This is what is required. You shall not go much further without it.

It is up to you. It is your responsibility, it is your challenge, it is your invitation. I urge you forward, my friends. I urge you forward on the road to soul awakening, soul development, all the gifts that lie within that beautiful soul of yours to come forward, to be expressed in all its fullness, beauty and light, so that you truly are God’s instruments, truly you are expressing the great potential that humanity possesses, but is almost entirely ignorant of it. You are to be the examples, you are to be the lights, you are to be the teachers and the healers. You are to be the ones that will forge the path for others.

May you be blessed with the strength of God’s Love, the ability to see beyond the veil of human consciousness that is so prevalent into that which is not so prevalent, nor easily recognised. God will give you the ability, the capacity to do so. It is for you to be aware and vigilant. Seek out this part of you with all your heart and soul, all your desires and longings as you seek the Love of God, so that part of you becomes more accessible and palpable in your consciousness. Seek it, my friends, and it shall seek you out as it does, always. God will ensure the reunification of your soul with your material mind in harmony and peace, in the qualities and wonderment that is you with a soul awakened and a mind in harmony with all that is within you. God bless you. I am Orion and I love you, dear ones, I love you. God bless you.
