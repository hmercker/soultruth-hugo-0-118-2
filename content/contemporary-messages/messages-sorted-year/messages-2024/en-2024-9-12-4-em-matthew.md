# I Will Come to Strengthen a Blessing With Each One of You to Invigorate the World

September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Nashville, TN, USA

Matthew received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Matthew. I greet each one of you, welcome you to this place, this moment when souls come together to reach God, to reach for God and receive the blessing of His Love. During your stay, I will come to each one of you with a blessing, a moment shared. A combining, if you will, to touch your soul and you touch mine. It is this sharing that will be occurring, in part, during these circles. For you each is on a mission to help uplift, re-energize and invigorate this world to become closer to God.

We all in the Celestial Heavens desire to strengthen you in this mission. So, we come as you pray, bringing you our gifts of love, truth, and many blessings. We ask that you be open for the duration of our time together in this environment. We will share love here. So much love that you will be invigorated before you travel out into the world once again. We all are very thankful, happy and delighted that you are all here to share this experience together.

May God bless you. May we now raise you higher and higher into the Father’s Love, into His fountain of Love where you may drink. God bless you, dear children of God upon the Earth. God bless you.
