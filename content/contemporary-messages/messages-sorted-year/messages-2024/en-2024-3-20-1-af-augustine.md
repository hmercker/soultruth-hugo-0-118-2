# Describes the Purpose of Celestial Messages

March 20<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sydney Retreat, Sydney, NSW, Austrailia

Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. I wish to comment on the way in which we deliver our messages and for what reason. When we deliver a message, even when it is a small group such as this, it is not entirely intended for that group. It is intended for the wider audience, since you are very diligent in broadcasting and recording these messages and transcribing them.

Each opportunity that we have to speak, we do so with the intention of teaching, inspiring and uplifting. We consider what we will say. It is not just something “off the cuff” as you would say. It is something that is considered when we observe, through our souls’ perceptions, the need that is there, not only within the individual group but with the many individuals who are connected with that group, what they require to hear, what is important for them to hear. When an individual asks a question and their response is that it did not resonate, it did not inspire, it did not bring answers to them, in many ways it is of no consequence to us, nor should it be to you, my beloved brothers and sisters, because the wider audience has benefited from the message.

This is our intent that the world may hear, through various instruments attuned to the Celestial Spirits, information that is relevant to their progression, that which they may take into their hearts, their souls, their minds that will help them to shift their thinking and their efforts and doing toward that which is in greater harmony with God’s Laws of Love, toward that which opens their souls to God, toward that which brings relevant information into their minds.

We do not come and speak as a casual thing. We do not come to entertain or to acquiesce to another who is seeking information that is not relevant to the soul. Rather we come to help ignite the soul in knowledge and in openness to God. Many make a comment that, when the message is being given, they fall into a sort of stupor and do not hear the message. In fact, they do hear the message within their minds and within their souls, but most importantly within the soul. There is an acknowledgement, there is an absorption of the truths given. This is important, that they are witnessing and receiving such information.

We continue on our journey of communication. We do so with great love and acknowledgment of the beautiful souls that you are and the joy that comes that we have this opportunity to speak, to communicate, to inspire. Even though we must do so through the limitations of a medium and the limitations of his mind and the receptivity of your minds. Yet, you must also realise that there is soul to soul communication as well and that we are connecting in this way, in a deeper way. Many who are a part of this communication, in one way or another, will feel gratified, satiated by what is given.

We communicate on different levels and in various ways. It is important you understand that, just because you did not receive these communications within the conscious mind, able to assimilate word by word, indeed you may absorb in different ways, through different avenues that are being expressed simultaneously as the medium speaks. On every occasion, given the possibility of an angel coming close to the individual who is listening, they will also be helped to receive on a soul level the information and assimilate it within the soul.

The assimilation within the soul is far more important than that of the mind. For what enters into the soul is truth and remains there for eternity, becoming a storehouse of truth that the individual can rely upon, not only on this earthly plane but as they continue to progress through the spheres of  spirit and into the Celestial Kingdom. This treasure trove of truth, this storehouse of knowledge is most important. There is so much given to you, my beloved students, in such a great variety of ways, beautiful, beautiful blessings, given with love, given by God through His various channels, given because you yearn for this and long for this, so it is given and given freely and abundantly.

May you be blessed on the road of truth. May you find joy upon the road of love, may you be an instrument for God as a channel of truth and love. You are being prepared, developed and awakened so that you may be that effective instrument, that you may indeed carry this storehouse, the treasure trove of truth within you. Stored not just in your mind, but in the mind of your soul where it shall have safe keeping and shall be used in times to come to help educate and enlighten humanity. It is our privilege and pleasure to be part of the link that brings the truth forward. It is such a blessing that God gives to us all, such a blessing to make possible the connection from us in the Celestial Kingdom, so very far away from this material plane, and to you who live upon this plane.

Oh what wonders, oh what blessings have come from the Love, compassion and mercy of God to help uplift His children and bring much for their edification and expansion of soul and awakening of themselves as they travel the path of spiritual desire and truth. God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you dearly, my beloved and beautiful students. Oh how I love you so. Oh, how I shall continue to be with you, to help you understand, to help you know and to realise the great Truths of God and His Love. God bless you. God bless you all on your journey. I love you.
