Received by Al Fike 

May the blessings of the Father's Love be with you, beloved souls. I come. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I commend you, dear daughter, for your prayers. For your soul is bright and resplendent in love. You are a light in the world, as are all of you, my beloved brethren, who come and walk in the glories of God's Love, who dedicate yourselves to receiving this gift, who come forth beseeching God to be with you that your souls may awaken to what God gives: the transformation of the soul, its New Birth in Love.

My beloveds, for all those who struggle from the darkness of the human condition, God lets down a rope that you may grasp. In so doing, God will pull you up from the darkness into light. God will assist you as you struggle. God will give you the strength needed to make that journey from darkness to light. For every soul who desires this, the assistance is given in many ways. The angels of the Celestial Heavens are eager to assist each one of you. The light of the Holy Spirit pours down upon you as you ask to receive the gift. Your souls find its succour, its light, in this gift. You are given all that you require to walk upon the path of truth, light and love, that path which I have shown the way and shall continue to do so.

I am with you always, my beloveds. Even in your struggles, even in those dark days that you may experience, know that I am there. That God's Love continues to shine upon you, waiting for you to reach up to grasp that rope of love that is given freely, that rope that shall never tear or break, that rope that shall pull you up into light. It is for you to grasp, to hold with faith, desire and trust as you continue, step by step, to make the ascent into this light.

There are times when you may rest, recoup your strength and contemplate the distance you have gone. There are times when you stride with great enthusiasm toward greater light. No matter what you decide or how you are at this moment, know that the opportunity to strive toward greater light is given with every breath and that you are loved truly, my beloved brethren. I love you. God's Love for you is infinite. The love of the angels surrounds you. The love of bright spirits, even your stellar friends, continues to radiate upon you. All that is of light and love, of beauty and grace, is given to you, beloveds and to all souls who aspire toward the highest blessing that is the Father's Love.

So, it shall be given as you continue on into the next year. More light, more love, more blessings are promised and shall be given freely. Allow yourself to bask in this light, to be embraced by God's Love, to know the truth deep within your heart that you are truly loved and that the power of love shall bring the changes and transformation that will happen deep within you and will happen all around you.

Be that beacon, my beloveds, truly a beacon of light. You shall know the joy of it, the freedom of it and the depth and breadth of it. All that comes with love shall be laid at your feet and you will know, in the very depths of your soul, the meaning and purpose of your existence. Your soul shall know and, in this knowing, you will radiate joy and recognition of what it is to be one of God's children, to be with all who recognise this truth and know the fellowship, the comfort and the celebration of being this great family of love.

My beloveds, seek the Kingdom and all shall come. Know the longings of your heart and soul and make this your guide with each day that comes. With this will come many blessings, much truth and great opportunities to serve in the Father's great plan for the salvation of humanity. For you have grasped this opportunity. Your hand clenches around this rope, this gift that God gives to you. You are inching forward into greater light and knowing the blessings that come as you ascend into the light.

May God bless you deeply, beloved souls. May the Truth of His Love carry you forward, awaken you and transform you, that you are no longer a mere mortal, but have come to the Truth and the transformation that is the Father's Love. That in this, you are assured eternal life and great blessings to come with every breath and every moment of your existence. 

God bless you, my beloveds. God bless you deeply, profoundly and powerfully, for love will bring all that you need, all that you desire and all the blessings that God's universe has to give. God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom. I hold the torch up high that you may see the light and know the truth. I am with you all. God bless you on this propitious day, this beautiful day of love. God bless you. God bless you.
