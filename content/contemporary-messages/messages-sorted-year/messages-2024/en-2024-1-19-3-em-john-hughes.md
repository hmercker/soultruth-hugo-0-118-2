# Give Thanks

John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John Hughes. You have much to be thankful for. There have been many blessings bestowed upon you all. And you may give thanks every moment. A momentary feeling of appreciation for what God gives to you is possible and even recommended. It will help you move forward in your progression, and I do speak to each one here. You are blessed. You are blessed with this love, with material comfort, with spiritual guidance that will stop, if you choose not to accept it. So, when we say, *“Be in the flow,”* we do mean allow that guidance to be fulfilled. Allow that love to pour to you and through you, the “through you” being very much a part of what you do upon this island, upon this Earth, wherever you are and a constant reminder to you is to give thanks to your Father constantly, joyfully, truthfully. Be in touch with the Giver of life. Be in touch with your own soul, your own feelings of this love and what a difference your life and the lives of those around you will be. It is as simple as that.

Give thanks to God throughout your day and see how you move forward so very quickly and bring so many others along with you. Your brightness will shine even more greatly. Your love will pour out to your community. And they will come. They will come to pray with you. They will come to start their own progressions and the blessings will flow. They will flow. I am your brother. I am John. My beloved sits here speaking my words. She has come a long way and we both love you, all of you. Within our souls, we love you. God bless you. God bless you all, all who are in this circle and those who are close to the circle and who are invited to step into it, if you so choose. God bless you. May the Father’s love guide you and be with you forever.
