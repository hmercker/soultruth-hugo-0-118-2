# Describes the Journey Ahead

Orion received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my friends. It is Orion. The world continues to progress toward transformation and healing. Though this is not obvious to you as the endeavours of humanity continue in their progress and their intensity, ever seeking more material gain, wealth and transformation in its own right. In this endeavour, humanityâ€™s goal is, in essence, to conquer the disparities and the conditions in the world that cause discomfort and a sense of lacking direction. So, the systems, cultures and economies of your world continue to add to the intention to build and secure humanity within the human condition, this reality that you have all created together.

As we have said, it is contrary to what is meant to be for your planet. Within every human soul upon your planet, there is an inkling, a sense that this is the case. These contrary conditions that continue to build will, in time, cause great stress amongst you all, for the contrariness of each direction cannot last forever. There must be a time where there is a split between the desires of God and the desires of humanity. I do not mean what has already taken place, which is that the great majority of humanity has split themselves from God consciousness. This has been happening for millennia. Rather, in a material sense, there will be a split where conditions contrary to God's Laws of Creation will cause great turmoil and great destruction in your world.

Not that God intends for humanity to suffer, but indeed, humanity blithely goes along its path without consideration, or without serious consideration, of what the world is reacting to and feeling. For your world is a consciousness. Your Earth has its own soul, so to speak and so it is fighting back. Indeed, humanity does not see this as a serious threat as of yet. There is worry and concern, but there is much yet that must happen before there is a serious consideration of what is happening and why.

You are on the forefront of gathering forces toward light, change and that which is in harmony with God. We continue to prepare you, to open the way for you, so that you may be that instrument, that beautiful channel of light and love in the world. Yet, you too continue to live in both worlds and feed both directions. This is unfortunate, but it is the case. In your worldly dilemma, it is difficult to separate and delineate between these two conditions that I speak of.

Therefore, you continue along your path of living in the material world with all its comforts and gratifications and live in the spiritual world with all its blessings and upliftment. But there will, for you as well as all of humanity, be a split where there is a choice. In that choice, you will see the direction forward. You will see and understand what it is that you must do to be in greater harmony with God's Laws of Creation.

This will involve some sacrifice, making your life extremely simple and the desires that come with that life in harmony with the simplicity of your own physical, spiritual and mental needs. This is coming. As you open your hearts and souls to God and your consciousness responds accordingly, you will see differently. Many of you are feeling a sense of discontent or detachment from what was a busy and, to a degree, a fulfilling life. Now, the direction of your thoughts and your desires is changing. This is a mild indication of the changes that are taking place within you and will continue to intensify.

Indeed, all you can do is continue with your prayers and continue being sensitive to your soul's perceptions and feelings. The more sensitive you are, the clearer will be the perceptions and the source of these perceptions. In understanding these things and being true to your soul, you can only but follow the way that your soul guides you toward. If you are true to this path, then there is no other way. But it is a difficult way, for all around you are those who walk that other path, the path that will, in time, disappear as the result of great change in your world.

Those you love, those who are close, will be greatly disturbed by these conditions that are mounting, fomenting and will bring change. You must be their rock. You must come forward in your perceptions and understanding of the process of healing the Earth and healing your own soul. You must be strong, steadfast in the light of truth and eager to serve humanity.

As the old ways crumble and the new ways emerge, it is for you to be a bridge between the two. For you live both and, in time, will be secured and dedicated to the new way, the new life. Have faith in this, my beloved friends. Know that you are on a great trajectory toward light, harmony and truth. That on the way, you must shed several skins, release many things that hold you back from the purity of that light, the purity of being in harmony with God, harmony with God's plans for the reclamation and salvation of your Earth and all within it.

Be eager rather than have trepidation and fear. Be joyful, for you are about to witness a great transformation, something that does not happen often in the universe, but something that is indeed a remarkable event. This draws many of us to you and this brings the attention of all spirits and angels of light to bring their upliftment, ministrations, wisdom and blessings to you all.

So, the process continues. I continue to remind you of the direction in which we are heading, that you might see more clearly and be more diligent in your efforts to change your attitudes and your efforts to change your soul in Love. This is the focus, and we continue to support you in it. May you continue to know the blessings of the great Creator's Love, that substance that binds the universe together and infills your soul, changing your universe and making it cohesive, in harmony and blessed.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. My love is with you as always. I am happy to speak to you once again in the light of truth and the ways of love on the journey toward light. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
