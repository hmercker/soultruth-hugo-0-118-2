# Spirit Influence and the Moral Compass

April 15<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

My dear friends, it is I, Judas and I want to start by saying the connection, the divine connection in this beautiful circle is transforming lives. The magnetism of Divine love attracting so many in the spirit world. So, I thank you all for staying the course and I wish to speak on the subject of spirit influence. You were reading earlier what Luke had said about discerning with the heart, with the soul, rather than the mind. And of course, John had written *“try the spirits and know that they are in the love”.*<sup>1</sup> 

This is not only relatable to mediums or, shall I say, those who you consider mediums, because all are mediums and there are many spirits vying for your attention throughout your day and into the evening. Those of you who stay focused in your soul, in your prayer, create a shield from negative spirit influence, and as you grow in the love, your shield becomes ever more protective and the lower spirits, knowing that they cannot penetrate go elsewhere. Often for those on the spiritual path, this is a daily challenge, though one may not be aware that it is spirit influence that causes one to make decisions of one kind or another. 
    
Did you know that those beautiful souls that you designate being on the spectrum or bipolar or even those with split personalities, they are very sensitive to spirit influence. In fact, if you have spent time with one of these dear souls, you’ll have realized, in one way or another, they are a barometer of what kind of spirits are around. Now of course they don’t always have the privilege of a filter to differentiate between the lower spirits and the angels.  But you, who watch over them can always guide them, not only to a place of harmony, but a place of prayer, by your own practice, for they can discern the harmony or lack of in your soul, and there is much to be learned from these beautiful souls, whose transmitters and receivers are so finely attuned and yet, so vulnerable. In this way, you can help each other.
  
If you have a barometer and realize the weather is changing, you can always make adjustments in the physical world. On the spiritual journey, it becomes necessary to pay attention, to be sensitive to the atmosphere, if you wish to call it that. To be aware that one can always call on God, the angels for protection, for love. To have a moral compass in the world, that is alive, is a wonderful thing. For, so many have abandoned it and one does not even need to be in Divine Love, because every soul has a moral compass built in. 

It is only when, the allurements of the world begin to tug one away with perhaps a desire for power, for wealth, for physical pleasure that this moral compass, in a sense, gets conveniently turned off and one is so affected by material things and lower spirits, that they refuse to feel which direction they are heading, until at some point during a life on earth, or more often and most eventually in spirit, they awaken and this can be a horrific or deeply disturbing realization at the very least. 
    
The love of God embraces all. One’s moral compass is awakened and the perceptions of the soul, embracing the natural love, helps one to love all. Be mindful of the spirit influence in the world on those who have not awakened to this great love, whose souls are still sleeping, who may be very lost in the material world and yet all are children of God. May the love in your souls awaken them. May the light that surrounds you shine upon them and may your heart full of mercy and compassion embrace them. I think I have gone on long enough and I thank my brother for bearing with me this evening and for all your beautiful souls, so blessed to have found each other in the love of God. 
   
I am your brother in Christ and your friend in eternity. I am Judas. Go in peace.
