# Endless Love 

June 25<sup>th</sup>, 4:30am 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



You seek eternity not knowing what it is, yet, not wanting what it isn’t.

For the eternal unfolding of the soul is a timeless masterpiece— 

The work of an artist who continues to create all things evolving, all things opening.

The number of infinity and singular beauty of one add up to Love.

For is it not said that God is Love?

The munificence of wonder ever exceeds the wildest expectation of even the highest angels.

Who lead the way, who light the way, for if not for love none would matter.

The promise of reality that an illusionist projects is but the veil over the real

And yet God is the great illusionist, unveiling the realities of his essence through creation,

While bestowing it to those wanderers hungry for it

It is a show unending, a promise ever fulfilling, a gift unfolding.

Endless, Endless Love—The why and the wherefore of all.

Thank you, my brother. I am Kahlil. I love you.
