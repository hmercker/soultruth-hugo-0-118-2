# We Continue the Journey Together

July 16<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Orion received by Al Fike

I come once again, your friend Orion. I come to pray with you and to be with you. I come to witness your progression, struggles and your triumphs. All these things that a human upon such an Earth as yours must endeavour to overcome and to experience. There are few planets in the universe that experience conditions such as this. You are a great fascination for many as you continue to overcome darkness and seek out light, to see the strength within you, to acknowledge your efforts, to see how in formidable conditions, you continue to strive toward light. You continue to seek truth and to seek the Love of God to transform and to make you strong and clear channels of love in the world.

All your efforts, beloved souls, will come to great fruition and beautiful awakenings. These things, I know, come slowly in your minds. But as the world continues to go through its machinations and its devolution from light to darkness, you are reversing the trend for yourselves. This may not seem obvious to you, but it is to us. In time it will be for you as well. As we all continue to strive toward greater light, to empower our souls in love to such a degree that we may truly be Godâ€™s instruments in the world in such a way that many will be affected positively, beautifully by your gifts and will be open to the message that you have to give.

There is much coming, my friends. I know that we say this often but as time progresses and as you progress through the time that you have on Earth, there will be great changes and great accomplishments. Each of you is endowed with many gifts. Each of you has been blessed deeply and each of you will express yourselves in all the beautiful ways that God intends for that expression to manifest on the Earthly plane. May your heart be warmed and your faith be strengthened with this, all that I have to say. For it is the truth. We continue the journey together, beloved souls, seeking the light, the truth and the love that comes from the Creator of all. Blessings to you. I am Orion and I love you so, my beautiful friends. We will continue. We will continue. My love is with you always. God bless you.
