May the peace that passes all understanding be with you, beloveds. I come. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom and your friend. I come to encourage you and to uphold you, for I love you so, my beloved friends upon the earth plane. We draw you all into that great Hall of Peace, that beautiful chamber that God has blessed us with and made possible your ascension into this place of light and peace. I urge you to open up your sensitivities so you might know that you are being drawn there and to feel the blessings that reside there. For each of you has been blessed with this gift, this experience. None of you is unworthy. You are all worthy of this blessing.

In this place, this chamber of peace, you may pray and open yourself to the great gift that is the blessing of the Father's Love, His Essence flowing into your souls. Make this your first and foremost prayer. Every prayer that you make, make this the beginning, the middle and the end of each prayer. Ask for a great inflowing of the Father's Love. Ask with all earnestness and desire. For this is the Essence of which I taught, the truth that came with my presence upon the Earth so long ago and continues to be the great blessing given to humanity. When you seek in this way with all humility, grace and love for God, then you rise up in your condition, in your light and you are brought to that place of great healing, peace and love.

Allow this to be so, for it is your will and choice to enter therein and to focus your thoughts and desires upon the highest truth and the greatest of blessings. Do not hold yourself back from this. Put aside all conditions and thoughts that might hold you from it, for it is within your capacity to be in that purity of desire, that beautiful condition of soul that dictates the blessings that might come, that opens the door to God's Touch upon you. All things of God come with your receptivity and desire to receive His blessings upon you. When you put these desires first and foremost, when you start your day with a prayer that asks for His blessings of Love and all that this entails, then you set the course of your day and your life toward awakening and growing within your soul. 

Your body and spirit body are merely a vehicle for your soul, and your soul has been given the gift of life, created by God and given the journey of life where you and God co-create together what may come of this journey. So, it is a great responsibility that you carry for yourself, to choose for the highest, to choose to be in the light. to choose thoughts that are of light, to be a loving channel for God in the world. If you can do these things with grace and with consistency, then you are well on the road to entering into the Celestial Kingdom. 

When you come to that entrance, that great Hall of Light that is the entrance to the Celestial Kingdom, you will find yourself replete with joy so great, so expansive, that you may fall on your knees in prayerful tears of joy, for you have come home to that place where God intends for you to go and to reside for all eternity. The ways and means, the swiftness of your travel, is determined by you, beloveds. It is determined by your choices and desire. Do not take this opportunity lightly, but indeed, embrace this opportunity, this blessing and be with God. Be with God at this moment. Be with God with every moment and your life will change irrevocably and the blessings will flow abundantly.

Follow the road of truth, beloveds. Follow me along that road and I shall lead you to greater light, truth and love. I give this without reserve. I say to you with great dedication and love that I am your brother and I shall lead you in love. I shall bring you to peace and I shall ensure that you will feel the joy of being redeemed by the blessings of the Holy Spirit. These things are given by God freely. I merely point the way, but it is for you to set your feet firmly upon the path and walk within its  grace and blessings, the narrow way toward at-onement with God.

I am with you, beloveds. I am Jesus and I love you. I love you all, so unique and beautiful. So beautiful. Your souls shine forth. Allow it to be so with every breath and know the peace that passes all understanding, beloveds. God bless you. God bless you all in this grace that comes on the heels of your prayers. God bless you.
