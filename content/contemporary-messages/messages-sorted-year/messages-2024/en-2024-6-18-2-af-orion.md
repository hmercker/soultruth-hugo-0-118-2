Orion received by Al Fike

It is a fine art juggling your material concerns and chores with your spiritual concerns and efforts. I am Orion. I come to reassure you, my friends, that indeed as long as you make efforts every day to be in harmony with your own soul and with God’s great Soul, then we are able to come close and to assist you in the material concerns, helping you to release those mindful concerns, that they may be dissolved in the light and blessings that we might bring and what God might bring.

There are times when you seem overwhelmed with these conditions. You are so entrenched within them that you do not feel, hear or see our presence, our efforts. This does not mean that we have created a distance from you. Rather, in your mind you have created a distance between yourself and us. We do not put aside our commitments toward you. Rather we are always there and we always make the effort to be with you. Of course, we are not entangled in these material concerns. We have the luxury of being detached from these things.

Yet, you also may be detached if you desire to be so. This does not mean that you neglect what you must deal with in a daily life, but your mind may indeed travel toward more spiritual thoughts and more emotional love-filled expressions rather than be frustrated, anxious or have those human concerns and feelings that are so common in your world. It does indeed take practice and finesse. It starts with your choice to go beyond that level of material concern, that place of mindfulness that is so common and indeed has been so common in your life.

Now you are on a different trajectory. Now you seek to be in alignment with God. In order to be in alignment with God, all of you must be in alignment with God. It does not mean that you can parse out your personality, all the components within you and say, “this portion is for God, this portion is for the material concerns, this portion is for other things, pleasures of the Earth, etc.” My friends, this does not work. This attitude and this way of doing things is not functional. For you are not a segmented person. You are the sum of the whole of all of your parts. Indeed, in order to come to God, all of you must come to God. All of you must be in alignment with that great connection, that great at-onement with your Creator. In this way, then powerful blessings come. In this way, your consciousness then opens, receives and is aware as you come to God.

There is no sense in just half of you being present with God while the other half is present with mindful concerns. As mundane as they often are, they are not helpful. Nor will they bring you to that full-fledged consciousness of the soul. This is what you are aiming for, this is why we come to you so earnestly to support you and to help you in this conscious decision and effort travelling the road from the material consciousness to the soul. This is what you must do. This is where you must go. Indeed even if you only get part way there, at least you have made that effort. The next time, is it not possible that you will go further? The next time even further until you come to that place where you are immersed in the presence of God, the consciousness of God and you are embraced by God with His Love.

Is this not preferable over the mundanity of your daily life? Is this not preferable over the dissatisfaction you often feel in your spiritual life? It must take 100% of your efforts, your focus, your consciousness in prayer, in allowing the desires of your soul to be expressed to God in all its wholeness, power and beauty. Be with God, my beloved friends. Now is your opportunity. There are other opportunities that come in your day that will allow God to touch you deeply and to do so in a conscious way.

God does not hold back His blessings. You hold back from God in your consciousness, in your efforts because the mind has been given a predominance and the power to control your consciousness. Is it not time to take back this power, beloved souls, to walk in the light and truth, blessings and peace of a soul that knows God well?  In your soul, my beloved friends, in your soul is great light, great wisdom, great joy, great love. Is it not time to live within this consciousness rather than to allow the power of the material to dictate the quality, depth and breadth of your life?

You wish for a spiritual life. You desire this. You seek it and you make an effort toward it. Indeed, that part of you that is in control, that part that is materially oriented continues to have dominance. You must look at this, my friends. Look hard and long at your patterns, the way in which you conduct your life. Do not go half measure toward God, but be full measure within the grace of God. In this way, you not only find great joy, fulfilment, you also become a magnificent and beautiful example, a channel of love for God. Be that individual, beloved souls. This is what we are teaching you. We do so day in and day out in a variety of ways, through a variety of instruments, giving a variety of messages. In essence, the message is the same. Go to God wholeheartedly, with great faith, with great desire and be with God in the wholeness of His embrace of your beautiful soul, aware, acknowledging, embracing your Creator. This is what you require to move forward. Indeed, you take those steps. I merely wish to encourage you to speed up the pace, to take the great leap of faith and be with God wholly and in the wonderment of at-onement with Him.

I am Orion and I love you so, my beloved friends. I see you progress and I want to push you a little more, to encourage you a little more, so that we may get to our destination soon. For how long do you think we have, my friends, to accomplish this? The time of reckoning comes close where humanity will be in the turmoil of great change. Will you be ready? That is my question. Will you be ready?

God bless you, my beloved friends. My love for you is great. I am with you. My dedication to you is complete. I am your friend always and shall remain so for all the time you are on this Earth plane. Blessings to you, blessings to you, my friends, in love, in grace, in bliss, in joy, in at-onement. God bless you.
