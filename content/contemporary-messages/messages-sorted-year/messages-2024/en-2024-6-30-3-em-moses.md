# A Seeker Receives an Invitation

June 30<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Moses received by Elizabeth Mack

Of this Divine Love, I seek it far and wide and yet, I find it here, in this humble circle. I look to the heavens to seek this love. I see from the Creator, this source of this love and I am here, Creator. I am here. I seek your love. I seek your love.

I am with you. My dear child, I am Moses. I will bring you closer, closer to the truth of this Divine Love, closer to the seat of all love. For your Father is waiting for you. He has brought you here to see that the love originates with His Soul and you may expose yourself to it directly. Open your heart, your soul with the intention of receiving from the Source, the Creator of this love. My blessings are with you, and I will travel with you as you learn more of this truth of the Fatherâ€™s great love for each of His children. So great, so powerful is this love and you, too, may experience it and receive it for the asking.

May God bless you in your walking this path. May God uplift you, bring you further into His arms. May God protect you as you journey this elongated path and reconcile yourself to the love of the Creator in your time. May God bless you. I am Moses, your brother and a true follower of he who first brought this Divine Love to our awareness. He being, Jesus, the Master of the Celestial Heavens and one who watches closely your journey. May God bless you.
