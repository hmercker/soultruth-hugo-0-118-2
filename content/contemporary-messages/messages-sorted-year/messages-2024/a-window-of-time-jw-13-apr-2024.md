# A Window of Time

April 13<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

##A window of time##

You have a window and there is a bird just outside

Having a conversation with her friends on the other side of the glass

She cannot see in but senses your presence 

You cannot see her clearly but you hear her song
 
 lively and spirited 
 
 full of life

You have a window 

A window of time 

In which to make your song 

Your conversation 

Let it be of love

May every note that falls from your heart 

Be like a giant hug to the world

Every note played perfectly 

In Time 

With His rhythm 

Calling out 

For His embrace 

Hafiz
