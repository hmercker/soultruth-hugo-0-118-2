John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Beloved and yes, there are many who would like to speak but they are not allowed at this time. For I have a message for my beloved brothers and sisters who are upon this path of Divine Love. I am your brother in Christ, one who followed my Master while on the Earth and continues to follow him through the Celestial Spheres and we do this by praying.

Praying is the way we ARE, the way we BE. It is not a separate action from what we do. It is how we are. We contemplate upon God’s Love and our souls fill with this love. We move about on the Earth plane, giving our love, expressing our love to our brothers and sisters and more love comes into our souls. We heal with the love of God. We speak truth that is from God. We possess the love and the truth within our very souls which emanates outward to each other, to our Father, to our brothers and sisters which brings more love. We are love. We are one with our Father in this Divine Love and yet, separate personalities, individualized when we incarnated into the Earth. And yet, we are open always receiving our Heavenly Father’s will and love. You, too, will become this soul who emanates love and receives love simultaneously as you walk upon the Earth.

Love with this love in your hearts and souls. Love your Heavenly Father, first and foremost and you will receive a response. Yes, it is simpler here in the Celestial Heavens to be in continual prayer to God. But it is not impossible for you upon the Earth to continuously receive God’s Love. Be the love of God that you have in you. Express it and your Father will respond. It takes practice upon the Earth. So be patient with yourselves. You will achieve this if it is your desire. My love is with you. I am John, the Beloved and I will pray with you now and love you as I do so. The Father blesses us all now. Open wide children, open wide.
