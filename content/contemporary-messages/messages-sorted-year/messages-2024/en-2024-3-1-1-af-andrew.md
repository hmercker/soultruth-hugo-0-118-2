Andrew received by Al Fike

We are praying with you, beloveds. I am Andrew. It is important that you continue to multiply the Lattice of Light into the world. For this we utilise your gifts and efforts, in order to do so, in order to bring more connections, more love, more bonds of love between individual souls. This spiderweb of light that you are helping to weave in the world is so important. It helps to nourish and nurture greater light in the world. It helps to strengthen and help others to understand and realise that they are loved and that they are in light.

My beloved friends, the world needs this upliftment and support. The world needs your prayers, your good intentions and your loving ways. For you set the example. You become the soul that others aspire toward in terms of their behaviour and demeanor. Then, of course, you tell them about God’s Love and how this is the key that will open the door to such aspirations. My beloved, beloved friends, you continue to ride the wave of God’s Will and His Love for you. As you do so, others will be a part of this, and the Web of Light will continue to proliferate and flow and connect as it should.

There is no need for great concern and great effort in the ways of the mind and the intellect to formulate and to plan to make this a realisation of your concepts, your paradigms of what is truth and what is valuable. Rather, as you grow in the Father’s Love, as your souls continue to find greater alignment with our Creator and grow in light, these things come naturally. They are not planned. They are not formulated. They rise up and forth from your soul into your consciousness like beautiful flowers emerging in the garden, the garden of your soul. These things come naturally and beautifully.

Do not think of yourself as being inadequate or unable. For it is only a matter of time that many gifts will emerge from your souls, and much will come of these gifts. Have faith in the journey that God has placed you upon. Have faith in the light and transformation that comes with God’s Love. In this way, so much that you are not aware of within you, will emerge and do so beautifully, with an intensity and strength and width and breadth of expression that you will astound yourself. For many treasures are within you that you do not know exist. Much may come unbidden because you have asked for your soul to be awakened by the Father’s Love.

This process, this way of God, is so different from the human perspective and expression. This is what we are here to teach you, my beloved friends, to teach you of the ways of God, not the ways of man. How God brings to you many, many gifts, a cornucopia of blessings and capacities that emerge because of these blessings. Have faith in this process. Have faith in what may emerge and what may grow and strengthen within you and come forth fully formed and exquisite in beauty and ability. Many gifts, my beloved friends, are waiting to come forth through you, to emerge into your consciousness and to be expressed in love, harmony and grace. Each soul carries this bounty. Though unique to them, it is a great treasure trove of blessings, gifts and expressions that can help transform your world as it transforms your world within.

May you be blessed, my beloveds. I am Andrew. I am glad to be here in your prayers, to share in these things together. What a beautiful opportunity you must be in fellowship, to share with one another, to forge those bonds of love together and to seek the blessings of God, multiplied and made more powerful by your collective efforts and desires. God bless you, my beloved friends. My love is with you, always. God bless you. Andrew loves you. God bless you.
