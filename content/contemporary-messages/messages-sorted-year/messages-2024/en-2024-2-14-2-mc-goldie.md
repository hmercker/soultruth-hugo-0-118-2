I am Goldie. You are speaking about the attributes of the soul. I always bring joy into the circle. To truly experience joy that bubbles from the soul is a great blessing. When you are in the warmth of God’s Love, joy is one of the attributes that reside within the soul. I want to say we have watched our beautiful friends on Earth truly lacking soulful joy, especially these past few years when you have been experiencing great change, and uncertainty as you continue to wonder about the future.

The times are not like they used to be where you could simply let time pass and not be overly concerned. Now many are wondering, “how much time is left? What will the times ahead be like? Will it return to what it once was?” Many questions of uncertainty with the desire of the material mind to know. For when there is a knowing within the material mind, it creates a level of security. But you, beloved souls, you who carry God’s great Substance within your very being can dive deeply within this substance.

You can find joy, pure joy, joy that does not fluctuate with outside conditions and circumstances. Joy that lives in the centre of your being, that is secure and knows thyself. For with every drop of God’s Love that you obtain, there is a rippling effect within your being that works upon dislodging insecurities and conditions that inhibit the experience of the purity of soulful joy. So, as you ponder this beautiful attribute, take time to experience the depths of true joy. It is a substance within you, a sensation and feeling, expansive, without limitation, that requires no outside circumstance to be in any particular way. For it is of your being. It is the insecurity from the material mind that fluctuates when emotions rise up that are inharmonious, it creates an upheaval of uncertainty and puts limitations on you consciously experiencing joy.

You, our dear friends, have many things to be joyful about. So, take this time and discover the joy that rests within your soul and allow it to influence your vision to see through the eyes of joy, to find the blessings in the simple things. There is always something to be joyful about. For it is within you. It does not come from outside of you. Allow your expression of joy to be felt each day to know joy, to feel it, to taste it and to see it. It is simple yet profound. The quality of one who lives from the expression of joy radiates out and permeates the environments that they walk in and affects others whom they spend time with.

Exercise your joy. Come to know your joyful self. Allow joy to sit upon your face through your smile, the beam from the light of the eyes, and the softness. Allow joy to express through your words and your thoughts, experience the joy that rests within your soul. Allow it to dance and feel it in your body, to feel it in your breath. Let the expression of joy breathe your life. In this way, you will become less influenced by outside circumstances. You will not need to orchestrate circumstances to be in a particular way to feel joyful. True, pure joy comes from within. Circumstantial joy comes from without.

You, dear ones, carry the substance of joy because you carry the Substance of God. Allow joy to show itself to you. Be joyful, for you are filled with joy. My love and blessings as I sprinkle you with the dust that brings great peace to your mind and to your body. God bless you. I am Goldie, joyful Goldie. God bless you.
