# It’s Only the Love of God That Nurtures People

January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Barbados

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

We are mighty in our spirits and gentle and it is only the love of God that nurtures, that upliftment that allows us to be who we truly are. It is God’s will for us to be who we are upon the Earth as well as along our progression. But it is the love that truly awakens us to be who we are. This can be done upon the Earth as well as in the spirit world. So as women upon the Earth with this gift from the Father, we are truly who we are, gentle creatures, loving creatures, nurturing creatures blessed by this love as differentiated from our brothers who do not need to protect us when we have this love growing within us. They have a different purpose.

I was not confused in my gender when I lived on the Earth. I fought for God but incorrectly. It was fighting for my soul that was my purpose. I misunderstood but you each have this love in your souls while you live upon the Earth. You each can seek your purpose and fulfill it upon this Earth and in so doing, bring the Father’s will into fruition and His kingdom upon this Earth. Look inside. Connect with God to find your purpose. Pray and bring forward all of your gifts, all of your love and be connected always to our Creator and you will know. You will be what you are meant to be while even in the flesh. It is not a gender thing. It is a love thing, a connection with God thing. God bless you. God bless you. My love touches your souls joyfully, truly. I am Joan and I will be around. May the Father bless you deeply.
