I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come today to join you in prayer and to speak to you of the wonders of God’s Love. The power of which is the greatest gift that can be given to any mortal or spirit. The beauty of which will unlock and bring forth the many gifts of your soul. As the great gift of His Love continues to transform you and heal you, so the reclaimed you, your soul, exhibits and expresses its uniqueness and beauty into the world. 

You must have faith in this process, this blessing given by God. For it is given in love and it shall never be taken from you. As your soul builds in this Love, as it is reclaimed by God in Love, so you become a bright and beautiful soul, one that may be used as God’s instruments in the world, one that is a powerful channel of light and love. As it is cleansed and reconstituted in Love, so your soul becomes a beacon of truth and light in the world.  

Never underestimate the power of this Love to bring to you great joy and great capacities to express the blessings of God through you and around you. For as you walk the Earth in the light of this Truth in Love, so you are a beacon. You telegraph the truth by your very presence and by your very light. Though so many in your world are locked away in their mindful condition, their souls respond. Their souls react to your light and your love, for you bring the Essence of God into their midst. You are His channel of love, thereby breaking down the barriers, bringing forth the longings of another soul. Those longings may be expressed in many ways. Sometimes there is fear and judgement, but this is because the soul is stirred and the mind reacts. Do not judge your brothers and sisters who respond in this way, but be joyful that they are responding, that they are aware at some level the power of God’s Love influencing them. 

As you walk the Earth, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, disciples all, of the truth, be aware that God is using you every moment of every day. For He does not waste His channels of love and opportunities for them to be those channels. He makes use of every moment, my beloved friends. Every moment, so that you may be that formidable channel of light and love in the world. Even though you may not be aware of this, your souls are very aware. Your beings are in alignment to some degree with God and will continue in the process of deep and abiding alignment with your Creator. Thus, the channel intensifies. Thus, the light is purified and brightened by the great gift of God’s Love. Allow this gift free reign in your being and in your life. Feel the power of this Love influence your thoughts and your deeds. As you give this Love free reign, you will know great joy, fulfilment and purpose as God guides you, His Will expressed through you. 

You are indeed, his instruments in the world, unencumbered by mindful conditions and all manner of conditions in your world. Rather, you are the antidote to the darkness. You are the great channels of love for those who are in need. For the lonely, those in pain and those who are lost. This is how you may be my disciples and God’s instruments. Allow yourself to reach out to those in need. Do not hide your light away, beloveds, but walk with your head high and your light open and flowing as God empowers you with His Love and Light. 

It is a magnificent journey and a wondrous expression as God’s Love continues to transform you and heal you. As you continue on this road of love, you will find yourself in situations and places that you would not have dreamt of or desired even. Rather, God’s Will is separate from yours. You must come to know God’s Will and God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. As you know His plan and His Will, you will be used to fulfil this effort in many ways, through many circumstances and situations that will bring resolution and light to conditions that are not in harmony. Know that this is your purpose. 

As you seek the Love of God, God will employ you in great purpose and through many outcomes that will help to uplift humanity, that will help to dissolve the darkness and the disharmony. As the numbers grow, as many come into this alignment as they receive the great gift of God’s Love, so then there will be a formidable force upon your Earth that will help sustain this beautiful Earth of yours and help remove all that encumbers it and all that encumbers humanity in darkness and in disharmony. The world will find peace, beloveds. The world is destined to be at peace. May you find your way and your part in this so that the peace that will come, will come quickly and effectively, dispelling the disharmonies and conditions of the Earth that are not of love. 

Will you be my disciples? Will you be God’s instruments in this great work and walk in the world as lights beaming forth truth and love wherever you go? There is no greater opportunity for service to give to humanity than this. I beseech you to embrace the Will of God and to grow in His Essence of Love. Thus, you will find your way in the Light, Truth and glory of all that is of God and all that is of His Love. It is yours to receive, given your desire for this. It is yours to express, given your will to bring over to God’s Will. Together we will work for the salvation of humanity and the healing of this Earth. 

Walk with God, beloved souls. As you do so, I will be with you, always. Always and evermore, your brother and friend. I am Jesus and I love you all. Truly, I love you all. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. In the Light of Truth and Love, may you be blessed.
