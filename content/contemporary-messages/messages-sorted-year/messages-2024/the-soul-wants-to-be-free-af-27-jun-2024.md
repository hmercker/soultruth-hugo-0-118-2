Love, blessings of peace to come to you my beloved friends. My name is Fiona and I come with this dear soul to my right (Karanne). She has many guides, many who gather around her. For she invites and embraces with a willingness and an openness of the soul to learn, to grow in love, to grow in light, to grow in wisdom. We are all eager to help and support her as we are with each one of you, beloved souls. For we do not exclusively come for one. We come for all of you. We come to uphold you, to pray with you, to help you to awaken to your gifts and your true self, your soul, eager, longing to be with God.

My beloved and beautiful friends, continue in your efforts and practice to seek out the blessings of God, not only for you but through you, to seek to walk the road of light and truth, the highest road that can be attained is through your efforts and desires, through your prayers, through your application of truth. I do not mean application in the way of intellectually understanding these things, although this may help you. I mean to feel, know and experience the truth in your own way, along your own path so that you are not lost or waylaid upon that path.

Faith is an expression of this dedication. When you have faith in the truth, faith in the power of God’s Love to transform, then you are living that truth and you are experiencing that transformation. When you guard yourself in such a way that the mind ensures its dominance and the heart and the soul are second fiddle to the mind, then you experience difficulties, challenges, frustrations and pain. The soul wants to be free of the shackles of the mind. The soul wants to know the joy of this freedom that comes in the true knowledge of being loved by God. In that, these gifts that you aspire towards, these beautiful blessings that come, come readily and come beautifully to you, within you and through you. In this great flow of the blessings of God will come the joy and fulfilment of the heart and you will be freed. You will know the freedom. You will taste the freedom. You will cry out in joy the freedom that God has given you. 

As you do so and you see all around you those who have been shackled, those who are not free, have compassion, have love. May the joy radiate from you to all those around you, bringing the gentle invitation that your brothers and sisters may awaken from their slumbers, casting off their shackles and may join you in the great dance of freedom and joy. All comes from the Father’s Love. All must come as you beseech your Heavenly Father to give to you the gift, to give to you the blessings of His Love that has the power to break the chains of repression and pain, has the power to open the heart and bring the joy and freedom forth, has the power to open the perceptions of the soul and the gifts of the soul so that all is expressed in the radiance of your light, in all that is of that beautiful expression of the soul.

You have these things at your feet, my beloved friends. You are truly blessed, more blessed than the vast majority of souls upon this planet. For you have the key to this freedom. You have the truth resounding within your consciousness and you have the light burning within your soul. Grasp this with all your heart, all your mind and all your spirit so that you are truly in alignment with God and that in this alignment, more may come and you will be transformed in many ways by the hand of God upon you. 

My beautiful and beloved friends, I am honoured and joyed to be with you, to witness the unfolding of your true self that you may hear and know what your true self has to say to you, what your true self feels and knows within you. Come to know this part of yourself. In knowing this, you will know God and in knowing God, all truth will come to you as His Love opens the way and means for you to have the knowledge, for you to have the understanding and the discernment of a soul on the road of love seeking at-onement with God. God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Fiona. I love you.

Dear daughter (Karanne,) I am close, very close. We are in the garden together. We are in prayer. We are in every part of your life. We commune and are close and I am not the only one. There are others. How blessed you are to have such good friends, so many around you to uplift you and uphold you, to assist you in understanding and awakening to the truth. Your soul is beautiful and so are you, my beloved friend, a beautiful light in the world. You are loved, always and never alone, ever. God bless you, my dear and beloved friend. I love you. I love you. I love you. Thank you and God bless you, beautiful friends of the beautiful soul. God bless you and I love you.
