God bless you, beloved souls. I am one of many Celestials who are working with those of you on the Earth plane. I come to assure you that what you seek in this great blessing of Godâ€™s Love will bring all that you require, all blessings, all that is of light, all that is of love, all that is of God. Do not falter upon the path, but seek this. In so seeking you will come to know me and many others who reside within the Celestial Kingdom. 

I was at the right hand of the Master, favoured by him. But not because we had a special relationship, but because I understood more than many others the message that he brought. I felt deep within my soul the resonance of this truth. I strived to be in the light, to follow the teachings of Jesus and to be close to him. Indeed he was blessed and comforted by my closeness and our relationship together.

It was not a physical relationship, but a spiritual one.  We travelled many miles together and I served him, as one would, washing the feet of the Master, upholding, bringing food, acknowledging and speaking loving words. These parts of me blossomed with him in my life. I discovered deeper parts of myself as he walked and I walked with him, as did many.  

My beautiful friends, seekers of truth, your light is glowing within you. Be like the Master, our beloved Jesus and walk in the world as a channel of love, peace and truth, a servant of God, a beautiful light. You too will draw those to you who are seeking and who will be comforted by your light, your presence. Do as the Master did. Be as he was. Show your light and aspire for the highest and you will be blessed beyond measure. You will be seen by many and many will come to you seeking solace, seeking love, seeking truth. It comes in the glow within your soul. It comes with the flow of love through your soul to others. 

You desire to be a servant of God and a servant of man. I say to you, as you grow in the love, so this shall be. You will walk in the way of light and you will be a disciple of the Master, you will be an instrument of God. It is for you to choose and to be in alignment with God, to receive that great gift of Love. In this way, you will know His guidance. You will feel the impetus, the flow of His Will in your life. You will be blessed and you will be the one who blesses others.
God bless you, beloved souls. I am Mary Magdalene and I love you. Dear ones, I love you. God bless you.
