# Jesus and Mary Bring Comfort to Those Grieving

Beloved souls, I am your brother and friend Jesus. I come to bring my love and comfort to those who are experiencing loss, those who grieve, those who struggle, those who do not find love in this harsh world. I come with my love. I come with compassion and desire to comfort you all as you seek your way upon the Path Divine.

This does not mean that the trials and tribulations of an earthly life disappear. Rather it is your challenge to go beyond the pain of these things and be in the peace and bliss of God’s embrace. God extends His Love always to each and every one of you and to all on this earthly plane. God makes it possible for His angels to come and be with you as you desire for the highest gift of His Love. It is given freely and abundantly. When you are in that place of grief and suffering I say to you that you are strongest because your soul yearns for God and yearns intensely, responding to the difficult conditions of your life.

God is there, beloveds, and shall always be there for you. I am here for you, beloveds. Many angels are here for you and the blessings that may come as you continue to open yourselves to the inflowing of God’s Love. These things are given through God’s great compassion, mercy and love upon you. These things are given because God intends to heal this world of all that is of pain and darkness. These things are given because your soul longs for this. All is given in love, all shall be accomplished in the gift and blessing of His Love.

I embrace you, beloved daughters (C & D). In your grief I embrace you. My love for you is great. My love for all who have had loss and heartache. Know that these things shall pass, that you will know the joy everlasting that comes with your soul awakened in the Father’s Love. Your loved ones are taken care of, that the angels are close, and that all that is required is given. Pray for your loved ones, that they may be receptive and open to the blessings and be freed from the earthly conditions and be in the light and joy that is God’s Touch upon them. May you all be blessed, loved ones. Each one blessed and given what they require to be uplifted, to be free from the earthly conditions, to be in the joy and communion of God. 

I am with you. I am your brother and friend Jesus. I shall never leave and I pray for each one of you. I pray for your loved ones. I pray for this world. May the weariness fall away, and that the vitality of true life, true awakening, the expression of love within the soul come forth and truly be the expression of each one of you. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you always. God bless you.

### Mary Speaks

Peace be upon you, beloved souls, I am Mary. I come too to bring my comfort and peace to your loved ones, to all of you on this earthly plane. In time, the pain and grief will pass, dear daughter and you will know freedom, joy and peace. All loved ones whom you pray for are being attended to and helped along the journey of adjustment. For it is quite an adjustment for each one to go from the earthly plane to the planes of spirit. 

There are helpers, many, who shall uplift and embrace and teach and comfort. Continue to pray for those in need, continue to be in the light of God’s Love and I will be close. I will be close, beloved souls of God. We are in the grace of His Touch. Open yourselves to it. You will find great relief and upliftment. God bless you. God bless you all. I am Mary and I love you.
