John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am with you now. I am your brother in the Christ Spirit of Divine Love. I am John, John the Beloved. I welcome you all to this condition of love, to this sacred space where your souls may open to the inflowing and free flowing of our Heavenly Father’s love. Let us help you to bring you higher, that your souls may open wider. Let us guide you and bring to that condition where you are in the river of love that is always present. Immerse yourselves. Bring all that you desire healed, bring all that you desire of God, bring your love and let it flow to the Father as you wash yourselves and allow this stream of love to flow over you, to heal you, to bring you great joy, great peace, great love.

We who live in the Celestial Heavens, surround you, uplift you, protect you as you learn how to serve your Father, each other and your fellow brothers and sisters. We are privileged to serve you in this way. May God bless you abundantly, consistently as you keep your souls open to His presence, His grace and His love. We love you, dear children. We love you so dearly. I am your brother, John. My blessings are with you as are the blessings of the thousands of Celestial Angels who are with us tonight. God bless you. May the Father’s love shower upon you forever.
