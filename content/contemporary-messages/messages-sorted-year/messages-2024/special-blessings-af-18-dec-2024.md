Bless you, I am Keea atta Kem. I come to love you, to cherish you, for I know in your world it is hard to come by love. Indeed, that love is an important element, an important part of anyone's life. But I do not speak of the natural love, the love of your parents toward you, the love of a mate, the love of your children and you toward your children. I speak of the Love of God, for that love is the love that shall carry you, not only in this life, but in your life that journeys forth into the spirit world and, in time, into the Celestial Kingdom.

How beautiful is this gift? How beautiful are you, beloved souls, who seek this love? For you have come to the highest gift, the greatest blessing of all and you are given this blessing freely and abundantly. Yearn deep, my beloved friends. Yearn deep and you will find that God will answer your prayers and your longings and that you will find the answers there for your questions, to seek the truth and know the truth. My beloved friends, so much awaits you. So much has already been given. But indeed, what has been given is merely a drop in the ocean of truth, of understanding God, understanding your own true selves and potentials and understanding the nature of life.

It all comes with the blessing of God's Essence flowing into your souls, awakening your souls so that you are capable of knowing, understanding, experiencing and feeling the truth, the truth of love, the Truth of God and the Truth of God's universe. It continues to flow into you and wash into your consciousness until there is a time when truth comes easily and blessings flow to heal and subjugate the darkness and the pain, transforming it into light. 

It all comes with prayer, with desire. Are you desiring at this moment, beloved souls, praying at this moment with earnestness, with longing? For it is time you have set aside for God and it is time that God wishes to give to you. In all its opportunities and blessings, this time given is given with great latitude and great possibility. Shall we explore this together, opening together to the great inflowing of the Father's Love, opening our souls, pushing away and breaking free of the restrictions of the material world and the material mind to that place of knowing, feeling and expressing the Light and Love of God that burns within us deep and brings us joy, joy everlasting, joy fulfilling, joy expanding in Love.

God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. I am Keea atta Kem and I acknowledge the dear daughter whose day it is, her birth commemorated.
