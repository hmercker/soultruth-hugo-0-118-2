# Encourages Unity Amongst the Divine Love Family

March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Hawaii, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

…but the consciousness must come to humanity, for how is the world going to change and be healed if humanity does not come to God to seek the truth? You have known this shift within yourself. You have felt the power of His Love to heal and to bring you to that place where you are not suffering from the slings and arrows of the human condition but finding peace and respite in your Heavenly Father.

So, it must be for most of the humanity, and as you see so clearly, their attentions lay elsewhere. They do not seek this because they do not know that they are in darkness and ignorance. Rather, they live their lives with their spiritual senses covered and numbed by the conditions of your world. They do not see because they are blinded by their own self illusions, their misunderstanding of life and their purpose in life. They merely see that which is rudimentary and material in nature. The spiritual senses are numbed and covered by that of the material mind seeking its fulfilment and the fulfilment of pleasures of the flesh.

What a rude awakening may come to many as the world changes and God’s intention for humanity is realised through intervention, through love, through greater light upon this world of yours. Those who do see must hold high the torch of truth, must be in alignment with all that is of love, must be with God always. For your strength and your purpose in life is to teach of these truths and to demonstrate them in your life. You come together in Circles of Light. You seek out greater truth. You insist upon living in the grace of God. So, you are that light, that hope for humanity.

There are those scattered throughout the world who are of like mind, who are of light. They are your brothers and sisters, truly. Honour them, beloved souls, honour them. Walk with them, saying, *“You are truly a part of my family. You are truly my brother and my sister. I honour you and I love you.”* Do not let minor disagreements stand in the way of such honouring. Do not allow the human condition to sully the purity of these bonds, the innocence of this embrace, light, love and truth.

My beloveds, you walk upon the Path Divine. Those who walk in the periphery, reach out and pull them into this light so that they may feel the firmness of this path and walk in the grace of God’s Love. You are needed, deeply needed, beloved souls, to teach the truth to others, to demonstrate to all that love is truly the answer to all the dilemmas that humanity faces. That love will bring the solutions. That love will break the barriers. That love will end the disagreements, the fears and the confusions that are so rife within your world. Walk in the Love of God and speak the Truth of this Love. In this way, you do God’s Will. In this way, you shall be greatly rewarded for your efforts, beloved souls.

I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come once again to encourage you upon the path and upon your ministries of light, truth and love. I love you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you upon your sacred path, the ordination of your efforts by the Touch of God. God bless you. God bless you in love.
