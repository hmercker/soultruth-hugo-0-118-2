# Revealing the New You!

July 13<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

…it is Seretta Kem. Indeed, each one of you has been moving through the process and integration beautifully, swimmingly. Allowing the new you to reveal, releasing the layers within yourself that are barriers between you and God. Barriers were what your mind thought you were, is now being with the ability to come into deeper awareness of who you truly are. The barriers between the mind and the soul are dissipating and are transforming. Where through your conscious awareness you are seeing sparks of light within. You are recognising shifts within yourself, a deepening of the desire for prayer, deepening awareness of longings, the deepening of motivation, the true desire to serve, for your gifts to awaken and for the demonstration of these gifts to receive opportunity.

All of this will unfold in the timing, in the order, in the way that is harmonious for each one of you. This is nothing that you can rush. This is nothing that you can push, but it is everything that you can allow. When you are in the state of allowance, you are receptive, and you are open. Just as you are open to receive God’s Love and flow into your soul, you must be receptive to the steps that unfold before you. For when you walk the Path of the Divine, every foot, every step is formed in a solid foundation of truth. As you step forward upon a new step of discovery, this must integrate into you, be solid in its foundation before the next step will present itself. In that way, your foundation is what your gifts and your awakening will blossom through.

You cannot skip a step. This is not a process of growing and awakening that any particular method or style fits for all. God knows who you are, what you are capable of and responds accordingly. Each one is a unique work of art. Allow yourself to move through the process that God is taking you, to be receptive, to allow the Master to mould the clay into a beautiful body of work. You will see your experience to be one of great joy as you relax into all that you are, all that life gives to you, all that life presents to you, for it is in that moment that the blossoming occurs. You cannot think about tomorrow and have your soul open. You can only be in the present moment and allow, witness, and observe the opening, the progression that God, in you, is manifesting.

We continue to be with each one of you. We shall continue to develop and bring our ministrations to you. Remain open and receptive to this. Recall what it is that your intention is, for these gifts to open within you. Clarify, become transparent in why you wish to be able to carry the message of God’s Love to the world and all will be very well. For you are all in the glory of God’s eyes. You have angels around you that love and support you. You have one another who you deeply love and support. So, it is all moving in the perfect timing of God’s grace.

Be deep in your prayers, deepen your prayers. When you go into your prayer, allow God and you to commune. We will be there. But ultimately, it is your progression, coming to know God, allowing God into you, that you are awakening, one-fold beautifully. I am Seretta Kem, so happy that each one has made it home safely and continues to progress in the light. God bless you.
