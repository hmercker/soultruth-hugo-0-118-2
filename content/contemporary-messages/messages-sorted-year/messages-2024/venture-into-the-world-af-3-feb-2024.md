Bless you, beloved souls, I come, I am Jesus. I come to be with my brethren. I come to pray with you. I come because I love you. I urge you, beloved souls, to continue to venture forth into the world as God’s instruments. Do not closet yourself away in those high conditions that you build within your homes and not venture forth into the world. I know it is easier and more gratifying to be in this condition of love and pray with God to receive His Love. This I also encourage, but there needs to be a balance within your life. One where you are engaged with humanity as God’s instruments, testing your mettle, testing your ability to be His channels of love in the world.

Without these overt efforts, you become stuck within those conditions that are comfortable for you. Yet God wishes for you to grow strong, to be flexible and to be willing to venture forth as His instruments. You pray for this often. You ask that you might be those instruments of love and peace, wisdom and truth, and you are at times. You continue to seek out your instrumentality, to stretch and grow within it. Indeed, as you practice and express these parts of yourself, they grow stronger, your abilities deeper and more able to reach out to many people. 

I did not cower away from the crowds. I walked with purpose and guidance. As I continued in my efforts and ministry, I became more of the light and of truth. I was acknowledged by many and you acknowledge me even to this day. So it is that God’s instruments must venture forth into the world and be brave and clear in their purpose, guided always. Do not shun the limelight, but enter therein with the confidence and faith that says, *“May I do your work, Dear God? May I be your instrument in the world?”* God will put the words on your lips. God will bring many blessings through you to others. It is a matter of connection and purposeful efforts so that you may be used accordingly. 

You are my brethren and you are my disciples. Think of yourself in this way. That you are acting as God’s intermediaries and channels of love in the world, just as I did in my day upon the world. It is needed and necessary. It is required at this time, for you have the luxury of movement and proximity with others. Do not shirk these opportunities, but walk in faith and truly be God’s instruments.

I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to encourage you, to affirm your instrumentality and your abilities which may be used by God to bless many. Be forthright, beloved souls. Stand tall and walk in the world as God’s instruments. In this, I and many angels will accompany you upon these journeys, these travels, these daily events that God may orchestrate and bring forward in your life.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. Blessed deeply, profoundly, with His Love. In such, grow in light and truth and wisdom, your gifts and talents blossoming in the light of God’s Love. God bless you. Know that I love you and I am with you. I am with you always, always.
