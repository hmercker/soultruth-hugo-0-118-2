# God Opens Up the Door to Communication from On High

I  come to you from on high come to you, beloveds. I am your friend, Andrew, and I come to pray with you. How wonderful is God that He opens up these doors of communication and blessings. For God is very far away, beloveds, in the condition of His majesty and wonderment, His Light and Being. Yet God reaches out to each one of you, each one of us and seeks to bless us all in His glorious Love, seeks to enwrap us in the beautiful light of purity and grace, seeks to uphold us in truth and wisdom. The power of love is such that every soul may avail themselves of this blessing. God does not restrict. God does not judge, but God gives freely and abundantly to all who seek these blessings. But seek you must, my friends. Seek with all diligence and earnestness. Seek with all desire and longing, for it is in the yearnings of the soul that the connection is made and the blessings come. 

Remember that, beloved souls, when you are faced with hardship. When you turn to God in these conditions, God will bless you and uphold you. When you come in gratitude and joy, express this to God. God will reinforce and double and triple your feelings and your joy. When you are in need of wisdom and guidance, ask sincerely and all that you require will come to you. The insights will pour forth into you so that you may know them clearly and you may know the power of the truth and the power of that influence of love awakening you toward what you must see, do and hear, that all that you are may be in alignment with all that is of God. 

Do you not seek this, beloved souls, children of God, the great alignment of your soul with God’s Soul? The beautiful benefits and blessings that come with this? For God seeks you out, each of you. Seeks loving communion, seeks for you to know Him and to be with Him, seeks for you to be open to His Love and His being with you. This is the fulfilment of your soul’s longings. For since the beginning, your soul has longed to be with God. Indeed, as you continue upon your path of awakening, your soul in its readiness and receptivity to be with God, then these experiences and this communion will be felt and known. You will truly know the joy of it and the wonderment of it. 

So, we are together now, beloved, beloved friends. We shall pray in all earnestness, desire and longing. We will be gifted by the Holy Spirit to bless our souls and to awaken us from our slumbers and to bring us into clarity and fully awake to our true selves. God is here with us. We are here with God. May we know the Holy Communion of His Touch upon us and feel it from the very depths of our soul to the very consciousness of our beings. May you be blessed, my beautiful friends. I am Andrew and I love you all and I love God. May we all be together in this love. God bless you. God bless you.
