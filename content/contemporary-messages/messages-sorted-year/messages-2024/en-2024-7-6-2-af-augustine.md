Augustine received by Al Fike

Very little will hold you back, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I want you to know that it is a clear road ahead. We are with you, supporting you, walking with you. God’s Hand is upon you. God continues to light the way for you. You need not concern yourself and worry for the future. The future is secured. It is for you to find your footfalls day by day, the opportunities presented to you, the possibilities opening to you. That you may find the joy and freedom of service to humanity as God’s instruments in the world. These things are a great gift, a great blessing.

Each of you have done much to clear away the debris of your own mental clutter and difficulties. Though, at times, I know you feel as if you are bogged down by these things. I say all is unfolding as it should and you are, indeed, walking along the path designated. We are very pleased, very pleased with your efforts and your harmony in the work that we have accomplished thus far and the possibilities of what may be accomplished. Beautiful souls such as yours are a rarity in this world, so we cherish you, we protect you and we guide you. We will continue in our efforts together. We will continue to walk in the flow of the Father’s Love and Will and find our way accordingly.

Yes, the world is a changeable place. At times the Will of God does not take a straightforward route, but is circuitous. Still, you continue to walk along that road. You do so in faith. You do so with enthusiasm and joy. This is all that is required. To listen to the Will of God and be obedient to His Will. To enact it with whatever gifts and possibilities of expression that are available to you is all that we ask. You will continue and you will see the unfolding days bring about much in the way of blessings, comfort, upliftment and joy.

So much awaits you. So much is presented to you and clear. You will find that your ministries will expand and grow in this clarity of light, in this blessing from God. Many will be drawn, many. You are beginning a new opening and awareness of your gifts. This will come day by day, be strengthened with your realisation of these gifts and the application of these gifts in your life. Much will unfold in the loving Arms of God. Much will be expressed as you gain confidence and clarity and greater love. As you do so, many will feel these attributes clear and strong within you and be drawn to this, seeking you out.

Indeed, as you consider embarking upon this trip that is planned, realise that more will come than you realise. More will come because, as you grow in light in these next few months, you will draw more in. As you connect with more, as we work together with you to bring more into the fold, indeed, they will make the effort to meet you, to greet you and to pray with you. Do not limit your thinking and believe that each leg of your journey will be impeded and unproductive by a lack of interest. I say to you; it will be the opposite of this. There will be much interest. Many will come because they are interested, because they desire to walk and pray with you for a few days or moments. Blessings will abound. We will be with you, close in rapport and effort. These individual’s souls will benefit greatly by your efforts.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, by God.  By His Love, by all that is good and graceful. All that will make travails in the trials of others easier, clear and of light. Is this not what you desire to do, beloved souls, to be an instrument for this? Indeed, God has heard your prayers and provided you with the ways and means of being a part of God’s plan, of walking upon the road that God has paved for you. May you be blessed, beloved souls. Your teacher, Augustine, continues to walk with you, to reassure you, to guide you and to love you. Blessings to you, beloveds. Blessings, indeed. Your teacher, Augustine, loves you dearly. God bless you.
