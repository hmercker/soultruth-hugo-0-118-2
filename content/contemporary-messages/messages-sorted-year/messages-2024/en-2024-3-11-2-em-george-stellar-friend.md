# Connecting with God

March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2024

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

George, Stellar Friend received by Elizabeth Mack

… a friend [^1] from a faraway planet. You may call me George, as you used to call me when you looked to the sky as a young girl. I saw you then and I see you now. What a wonderful transformation you have been making within your soul. I welcome you to this bright star that we have visited together, but today I am here to speak to our brethren and those who are in this Circle of Light and those who are not quite in the circle yet, but who are wondering about this light.

I am a great fan of my Heavenly Father, God, as you call the Creator. We communicate often, because I take the time to commune with the Creator, so that I know what I am doing, what I am to do and, sometimes, how to do it. On my planet, there are many people, some who pray as I do, some who do not pray as much, but have a connection and intuition about behaviours, what to do and how to do it.

I prefer coming into close rapport with the Creator, feeling the Love flow between us, my soul and the Creator’s Soul joining together. Such exquisite beauty and feelings. Obviously, I come to share this experience with you, to enjoin you to this practice of communing with the Creator who will fill up your souls, fill it with Love, blessings, joy and happiness and so many other things that make life worth living in the flesh, as I do.

I ask you to join me now in this prayer in communion with the Creator. Let me help you achieve this experience that you may feel all that the Creator intends for you to feel. We will together connect with God from our souls and God’s Soul.
