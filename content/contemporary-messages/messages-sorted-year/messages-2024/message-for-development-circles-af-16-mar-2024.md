# A Message for Those in Development Circles

March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Received by Al Fike 

God bless you. It is Seretta Kem. We are continuing with our development of each one of you in preparation for our circle together that is coming. Each one who is willing to put in the time in prayer and has the desire to continue with this, shall we call pre-development before you come together in your circle and you will have the benefit of our efforts and what is required to awaken these gifts within you. Today we shall continue with this program, helping you and assisting you in allowing communication between us and you to be clear and as effective as possible. 

This process requires time and development, step by step. There are certain material impediments that each individual upon the earthly plane has that need to be removed. There are certain elements of the brain that need what you would call fine tuning in order to be effective. There is always the development of the soul, in conjunction with the spirit and the mind, in order for all things to be in alignment, and that when you are being used as an instrument so that it will be for the highest purpose and effectiveness as a channel.

Each channel, each instrument, each medium will give a certain flavor and element to the information that is being given. Each has their own storehouse of words and information within them. We may utilise this uniqueness in order to give a unique message. It does not mean that one instrument is better than another. This is not the case. It merely means that what can be given through that instrument reflects the expanse and the limitations of that instrumentâ€™s capacity to bring through a message, a communication from us. As this instrumentality is opened and utilised, it becomes more effective, more beautiful, deeper and broader in capacity. 

As you can see with this medium, there is little resistance and very few barriers to our efforts to speak through him. This effectiveness has been developed over a number of years and the number of times that we have utilised him as an instrument is many. Much can be accomplished through him and our desire is that much can be accomplished through all of you who are willing to step forward in this way. It is your time and commitment, desire, ability, gifts and the development of your soul that will determine much in the development of your gift of mediumship. I give this message not for the three of you, merely (Al Jeanne and Matt), but for all of you who are willing to walk this road and to be developed in this way. 

I thank you for listening to me, allowing me to speak. My hope is that you will take to heart those things that I speak of. I will continue to do so as time passes. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. God bless you.
