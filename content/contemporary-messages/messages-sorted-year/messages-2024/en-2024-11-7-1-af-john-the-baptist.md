# Announces He Will Oversee Managing Messages Projects to Further the Dissemination of Divine Love Truths

November 7<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Managing Messages Team, Sechelt, BC, Canada

John the Baptist received by Al Fike

I am John the Baptist and bring you great joy and peace, for you have done a good work this evening. I am John, John the Baptist, and I come to congratulate how you have come from different points of view, merging into one voice for the purpose of bringing forth God’s Truths. This mission is important. You have risen above your mindful states and allowed the love to come through, the guidance to come through. Together, you have a path forward to produce what our Master has requested and what our Father is overjoyed that you are willing to do.

Be thankful for the love that guides you. It will always be true to your highest purposes. Continue to follow this practice of setting aside your preconceptions that you may do the Father’s work while you are here on Earth as a unit. You are blessed this evening, each and every one. You are blessed mightily by God’s Hand. This is an important work to be done and we in the Celestial Heavens will help you each step of the way to be clear, to be guided, to stay on the path that the Father has laid before you.

May you join together again and again. God bless you. I am your brother, John the Baptist, and I will be overseeing this project. My Love is with you, each one. God bless you.
