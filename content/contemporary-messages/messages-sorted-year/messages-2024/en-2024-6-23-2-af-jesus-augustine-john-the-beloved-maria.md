# Angels Pray with Us

June 23<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus, Augustine, John the Beloved and Maria received by Al Fike

**Jesus:** The angels in Heaven pray for the awakening of your souls and the awakening of humanity to light. The awakening of all efforts from all peoples from all over the world to bring peace and harmony to your lives on this planet. Each beautiful soul is blessed with the gift of free will and can choose light or darkness. What is missing in this, is that many are ignorant of what light and what darkness is. Many do not understand their own true selves, what they are meant to be and how they are meant to be in this world. A gift given, the gift of incarnation, the gift of expressing one’s self as an individual in the universe.

You have found a way, beloved souls. You have found a way to find the truth, to know the truth and to express the truth in your lives. That way is the power of love to transform, to enlighten and to bless, bringing peace, deep healing and joy. These things all from the grace of God, the blessings of God upon each one of you. You seek for these things because you have ignited within you, within your souls, a deep desire for the blessings, to reach for the highest, to be in the grace of God. Though you often do so blinded, stumbling about, seeking the truth, seeking the grace. Yet God, in His beautiful and wondrous Love for you and compassion for your struggles, continues to show you the way, continues to help you find your way.

He sends His angels into your midst. He sends His Holy Spirit to bless your soul. All of these beautiful attributes of God, creations of God, aspects of light, conspire to uplift you and to bring you to the truth. The truth shall be a living thing within you. The truth will be expressed as a vital force about you. My beloveds, my beloveds, you are truly blessed in the great gift of God’s Love. You are truly blessed in the light that surrounds you. You are truly blessed because you have chosen to be blessed, to be touched by God in the Holy Communion between your soul and His great Oversoul.

My beloved and beautiful friends, each of you is precious in the eyes of God, in the eyes of the Celestial Angels, and in the eyes of the bright spirits. Even those who are from other planets who are bright and beautiful, see you as kindred souls. All around you, arrayed all around, is light, love, peace, harmony and truth. My beloveds, we are truly God’s children seeking our way to at-onement. We shall, beloved souls. We shall find our way and find the fulfilment of our souls’ desires to be embraced by God, to know His holy Touch upon us and to be transformed in this way that comes to you in all its glory, abundance and beauty. You, my beloveds,  are blessed.

I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to also pray with you. To partake of the blessings of the Heavenly Father upon each of us. For I too seek this blessing, as do all the angels of Heaven, as do all whom I have mentioned. Seek these blessings, for it is the highest truth of the universe. It is the greatest blessing that can be given. It is the key to at-onement with God. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you always. My heart beats for you, for all of you, in love. It shall for all eternity. It shall for all eternity, beloveds. God bless you, beloved souls. Souls of light and truth, we walk together. We walk together in the light. God bless you.

**Augustine:** You carry the light of God’s Love within your souls. Though you are burdened with darkness and you live in a dark place, you are the hope of the world. The blessings that are given are profound and powerful. I am your teacher, Augustine. I too come to encourage you upon the journey of awakening and enlightenment, of love and joy. All these things are offered to you freely, because you have made an effort. You have sought out the truth and you have prayed to receive the truth. So, God has blessed you and given you that opportunity. May He use each one of you to give another and another and another the simple Truth of God’s Love, that their souls may be excited and ignited in desire to receive this gift. Continue in your efforts, beloved friends, students of truth. In this, you will have greater glory, greater light and greater blessings upon you.

God bless you. Your teacher, Augustine, loves you. We shall journey together along with many others toward the fountainhead of Truth and Love. It is given by God, freely and abundantly, to all who seek it. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.

**John the Beloved:** I too come to encourage you. For in times to come, the Love of God will uphold you. The Love that resides within your soul will guide you and bring you great wisdom. You prepare yourselves for a journey that will often be difficult and challenging, but will also be rewarding and uplifting. Much is given to you now, beloved souls, to prepare you for the future. We will be close always, and even closer during times of difficulty. When you are weakest, you are strongest, beloveds. When you cry out, God is there and hears your cries and responds in accordance to the intensity of your needs and desires.

Be with your Creator. Be in harmony and in alignment with all that is of God. In this way, no harm can come to you. Only the conditions that surround you may bring you some grief and concern, but within you will be strong. You will be at peace in the very core of your being, your soul. Come to know your soul, beloveds. For it is there that all that I speak of will be for you a great blessing, a great truth and a great strength. God bless you, beloveds. I am John and I love you dearly, beloved souls.

**Mary:** I come to bring peace and comfort to you, beloveds. You draw the highest angels into your midst. You draw them because you are sincere and desire the blessings of Truth, the Essence of God. So, these things come in great abundance. Great numbers of angels surround you and uphold you. We are with you always. Never to forsake you, beloveds, never. Be with us. Be with God and all else will be in harmony in your lives. All else will be of light and peace. I love you, my beloved children. I love you and shall be with you for eternity, as will be all the Angels of Heaven, continuing on our sojourn to at-onement with God. God bless you. I love you.
