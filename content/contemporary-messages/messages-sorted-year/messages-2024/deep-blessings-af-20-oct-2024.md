May the Breath of God be upon you, beloved, beautiful children of Earth. I come. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens. I come to impart light and love to you all, to assure you and to reinforce the truth with you. For I know that you struggle in the human condition. I know that each one of you aspires for the highest blessing. I know that you are loved and that, indeed, it is important for you to know that you are loved.

I tell you with all the authority that I have that you are truly loved. That not only does God love you with an ocean of love, but we love you with all our love. As you continue to grow in this gift, you will become a formidable force of love in your world toward one another, toward your families, your loved ones and toward all that you meet. For this is the inevitable outcome of these blessings.

You may have all the knowledge in the world. You may be strong within your mind, considering the truths that have been given. But without love, the expression of love, the wonderment of love radiating through you and from you, what good is this knowledge? It means little in a world filled with words and mindful concepts. Yet, what the world is not filled with is love. Our endeavours and God's plan is to fill the world with love, to have the power of love manifest in the hearts and souls of humanity, that they may release their pain and suffering, error and darkness and embrace love. For it is love that can heal these things. It is love that will transform all things that are of God.

Be with your Creator in yearning for this Love. Be with us, this beautiful accumulation of souls, yearning together, seeking this gift, seeking the peace that passes all understanding, seeking to be truly healed and transformed with the blessings of God.

We are all equal here together, for we are all equally loved and we are all lights together. For we bring into our midst, through the glowings of our souls, through the prayers of our hearts and minds, a great light, a beautiful blessing that goes out into the world as it continues to nourish us who know of this truth, who understand it and have great faith because love has imparted within us a knowing, a truth and the experience that is God's Touch upon us.

Do not muddy the waters with erroneous thoughts, doubts and mindful material concerns. Be clear at this moment in your desire, in your affections for God, in your efforts to reach your Creator and be in harmony and alignment with God's Will.

God bless you, beloveds. I am with you, your brother, your friend. I am Jesus and my love for you is constant, abiding and shall continue for all eternity. For love is the permanent blessing that shall last forever. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you always. God bless you.
