John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am your brother, John. I come often to pray with you in these circles and when you are by yourself. Today, I desire to bring the truth of God’s Love to those souls who visit, who are not regularly here who reside in the spirit world. There are many, many souls here. Yes, some of you are curious but beyond the curiosity, there is a desire within your souls. It is a desire shared by all those you see here, a desire that is in their souls that lights their souls. It is a desire to know God. God is your Creator. God is the Creator of all things, all souls, everything. God has a special gift. These souls that you see with light, that light comes from the Divine Love that God has blessed them with.

You are welcomed to join us in this prayer. You are welcomed to step within this circle, to open your souls and allow those longings to ascend to your Father and ours. This is why we gather. This is why we come together to ask the Father for His Love and as we do so, He blesses each soul uniquely with Love and with blessings meant for everyone to help them move forward in their progression. Look upon these souls that you see here. See the brightness. See the peace. See the joy. All of that comes from your Creator.

Join us. Open your souls and long for that Love that only God can give to you. My brothers and sisters will help you. We are lifting you all above the human condition, above the condition in which you normally live. We are bringing you higher, closer to God and if you feel the burning in your soul, it is that desire to be with God. So, open up. Open to this Love as we surround you all in this circle.

I am John the Beloved, and I come to love you, to help you, to uplift you, all of you along with my brothers and sisters from the Celestial Heavens and the Father’s Love flows into our souls. Open wide. Open deeply and feel the peace. God bless you. We are surrounding you all in God’s protection and uplifting you.
