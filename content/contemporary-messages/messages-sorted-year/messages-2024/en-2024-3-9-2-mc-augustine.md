Augustine received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you. It is your teacher, Augustine and I step forward to welcome you into what we can call the beginning of your formal development. For in truth, every time you sit in prayer, there is development, development of your soul - its growth in light and love which also has a blessing upon your gifts. Yet, you come into a specific circle, desiring a specific outcome where there is a purpose to which you have responded to an invitation from God who desires to use you as an instrument for truth, for love, for inspiration, for encouragement, as an instrument of light. And so, we respond according to God’s will, working in partnership together, meeting each one of you in the development and stage you are at and to the potential of this gift.

So, we encourage you to spend moments each day and see yourself, to see the soul as an instrument with this doorway of mediumship opening. For those who already have it opened, the door will move more widely open.  Walk throughout your day knowing you are an instrument in this way. But who is the instrument, beloveds? It is the soul. What is it that develops your soul? It is God. It is receiving God’s loving blessing, this gift from the Divine, always flowing to you. Do your best to remain open within the soul. For as your soul continues to receive this gift of Love, things that obstruct its freedom, its liberation, its expression will be cleared out. You can feel this when you have an experience of your soul, your true self when your conscious mind can perceive the workings of your true nature. So, allow the Light and Love of God to continue to awaken you. This is what will draw the angels close to you and help to develop the rapport. You will come to know us individually. You will come to know our personality. You will experience us as we are, each one of us bringing the uniqueness of our souls. Some are more gifted in the healing elements and work more closely in this light. Some come through in a more teacherly manner and some come through in a way of the construction of gifts, the development of gifts. There are many aspects to how we can serve.

So, take these suggestions to be open to our promptings, to invite us into your prayers and come to know us. This will fast-track your progression because your attention will be focused. There will be less distractions upon your progress. Yes, you live in the material world, and you have many demands. Yet, you desire to serve spiritually. So, it is your spiritual life that must take the forefront if you wish to fast-track your ability and development. Largely, it is in your hands. We are always at the ready and God is always waiting for our wills to serve in light and love with peace and compassion. And so, let us begin to bring your development to the forefront. We bring our blessings, our gifts and our love to you. I am your teacher, Augustine. God bless you.
