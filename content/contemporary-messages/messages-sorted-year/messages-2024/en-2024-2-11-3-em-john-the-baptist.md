# Focus on the Love of the Father

February 11<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Online Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Baptist. I join you all in this prayer, this prayer that uplifts your souls and asks the Father for His Love to heal and infuse His Love into your souls, to awaken those things within you that God has blessed you with, but mostly to awaken the Love. For it is the Love that, once shared and expressed, grows joy among those who are around you. It is the Love that is perpetual growth. It is the Love that helps you to see God, to know God and to bring your true being to the Father and be blessed by His Love.

It is only this Love that can work the kind of miracles that my brother, Jesus, worked when he walked upon the Earth. It is only this Love that will last forever. Beyond time and beyond space, it is this Love that will last. Open and receive this most sacred gift from our Heavenly Father.

God bless you. I am your brother, John the Baptist. I will come again.
