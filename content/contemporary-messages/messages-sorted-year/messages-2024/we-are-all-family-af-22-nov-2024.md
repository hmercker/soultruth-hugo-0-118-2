Yes, the universe does swirl around you, beloved souls. I am Moses. Your perspective and your perceptions are so focused upon this material plane of yours that it is difficult for you to comprehend what is truly God's creation. Those of us in the Celestial Kingdom have great vision of God's creation. We see you as children of God, as we see ourselves. We are all together in this family that is of God's creation.  

We reach out to you, beloved souls, to uplift you, to help guide you and to inform you, so that you too, someday, might see beyond your limited perspective. That your souls may indeed be awakened to great vision, insight and perception as God's great Essence continues to infill your soul. These gifts and perceptions come to life, arise into your consciousness and become a beautiful addition to your perspective and experience of life.  

Is this not the journey that you wish for? Is this not what makes life wondrous, amazing and awesome? This beautiful journey toward awareness, understanding and knowing God as your personal Father in Heaven. These things are gifts that God wishes for you to have. What holds you back is your own reluctance, your own focus of perception, your understanding of life and the distractions that come with this material plane of yours and all that is of the human condition, so much of which lacks love. So much is, indeed, focused upon the material. 

Yet you realise that your soul wishes for so much more. You have a desire within your soul to truly open up and awaken to the fullness and the wonderment of the universe, to knowing God in the way that only you can know God, in the way that only God can know you. In this personal relationship, which is unique to each soul, much comes. Deep and profound perceptions and awarenesses come to the soul that continues to thrive and feed upon the great Love of God. You are just beginning this journey, beloved souls, but indeed, you are further along than so very many on your earthly plane. In this way, God relies upon you and so do we, to bring this truth to others, to be an example, to be a beautiful light in the world.  

You are filled with great potential. You begin to glean the surface of beautiful perceptions and gifts. As you continue to grow in this Love, these gifts and perceptions will blossom, deepen and become powerful aspects of your conscious being, your beautiful life. Continue to pray for this great gift of Love. Continue to be that light filled with perceptions, filled with joy, filled with the capacity to love deeply, broadly and directly to many. 

In this way, you will fulfil God's mandate and His plan for the upliftment and salvation of humanity. You are the forerunners. You become the messengers, the channels of love. For those of you on Earth, encountering individuals such as yourselves, who understand, express and emanate truth, love and light, is a great boon to them. It is more palpable than going to us and to God directly. Although this is our wish that indeed each individual soul may know God intimately, powerfully and deeply, this is a necessity. But when one begins this journey, it is a comfort to know someone who is upon the path, who has experienced things and knows things that are a result of their efforts, their prayers and the growing of their soul in Love.  

That example, that teacher, that channel of love is important in the world. You, my beloved and beautiful children of God, be that channel, be that light, be that teacher. Bring comfort. Show others how it is done, the way in which they too may receive, know and express the Truth of God's Love.  

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Moses. I come from a long way away to be with you, to give you some encouragement, to counsel you a bit and to love you, dear children of God. For you are my brothers and sisters and indeed, I love you. I love you, beloved souls. God bless you in His Love. God bless you.
