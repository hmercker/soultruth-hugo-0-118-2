# To Be Open Is a Gift

January 9<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John’s mother, yes, the Baptist. I watch over all of you. I watch as you grow in your love, as you grow and develop in your gifts, in your abilities to transmit to other souls, those blessings the Father brings to you, to other souls walking upon this Earth. It is a pleasure, a joy to watch over you as you progress in your souls. For there are many who walk this Earth who are untouched by the love of God. They do not open to receive and therefore cannot express what they do not have. They are closed, closed down.

To be open is a gift, open enough, even with just a little bit of trust, to be able to feel the love that is available to you, open enough to be able to receive and transmit. It would be worthwhile for each and every one of you to pray to be more open to the Father’s will, to the Father’s blessings, to the Father that you may become a conduit for others upon this Earth in this life. We warmly welcome all of you to pray for these moments of openings and as you become more proficient, more and more of God’s love and blessings will come to you and you will be utilized more and more by God to assist your brothers and sisters in learning to love. You see, this is what it is really about: learning to love.

So take this time now and ask the Father to open your souls and know that is what will happen and allow that to happen, that you may experience the highest blessings, the most love that you will ever feel. May God bless you and my love is with you as you open your souls. I am the mother of John the Baptist and I thank you for coming here today and listening with your open souls. God bless you.
