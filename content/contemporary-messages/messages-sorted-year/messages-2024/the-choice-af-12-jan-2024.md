Received by Al Fike 

Bless you, I am Matthew. Do you not see and appreciate the uniqueness of each soul who is present? Their expressions crafted by a life’s journey, their soul’s awakening by the deep Touch of God’s Love within them, and all of those aspects of each individual create something magnificent, a magnificent soul, on their journey toward at-onement with God. 

Upon that journey, God orchestrates many experiences and opportunities to serve and the loving flow and touch upon their soul that they may truly learn the truth. That they may truly live within the truth. Each soul is gifted the possibility of this journey. God does not differentiate between a soul who is lost and dark and one who has found the light. God loves each equally. God continues to work toward their salvation in love. God sends His angels to help uplift and to guide, and to soothe and heal with their gifts and unique persons.

The economy of God’s harmony is such that no single soul will be left behind in the darkness. No single soul will remain lost forever, but will come to the fullness of truth whether that be the refinement of their being in their natural state or that of the Divine Path that progresses forevermore. They will find their way in time. Yet, as you might well see, to clear away the darkness of this plane, the plane that is unlike any other because it gives the gift of life, the embodiment of the soul within the flesh as the soul upon the journey of self realisation and awakening starts on this plane. The gift of life given by God. 

Now if this plane were in harmony with God’s intention and creation, the suffering that is experienced here would be no more. There would be joy and love, so that each soul may be awakened more readily. Though God does not curtail the opportunity of choice, God would put every opportunity that is available on this plane to help each soul see the choice readily and clearly. This too, is your opportunity to serve God, to present the choice to your brothers and sisters, to say that there is a choice. Indeed, that each soul may live their life in accordance to the reflection of their will and the will of others collaborating and creating the conditions, that which we call the human condition in the world. Or, each soul may choose to bypass that arduous journey and come to know the power of the Love of God, the Essence of God’s Soul that may infill the individual’s soul in accordance to their desire and choice.

This is a simple teaching. It is one that each of you knows. It is one that you have understood and expressed in your life. You have come to know that each moment brings its choice. Each moment has the possibility of stepping closer to God in prayer and desire, in effort of thought and deed to be in harmony with God’s Laws of Love, to seek the great gift of His Love. In this way, counteracting the conditions that have been created by human will and darkness. 

I know that each of you, if you could, would bring many souls to this realisation, helping them to understand the power of choice.  Yet,, as you have experienced on many occasions, to bring that choice, that information forward, many close their ears, shutter their eyes and will not speak of these things. So, you must persist, my friends. For the time comes when this choice will be crucial in their lives. Of course, their lives now are greatly influenced by this choice and often has the effect of causing much pain.

The time comes when humanity must choose and come to that place of harmony with God, of releasing the biases and the fears, the judgements, the error, so to come into the grace of God. You must express and excel in this light, this truth, and be that instrument, that teacher, that example, that light. For who else will present the choice? Who else is qualified to present that choice? 

There are many who speak of things that are reflections of the mind, the material mind, and have opinions and ideas of these things. Yet, this is more of the human condition, the condition of the brain and the intellect and all things that are of humanity’s creation. There is, and shall always be, however, the reflection and expression of God’s creation, of God’s great Soul expressing love, harmony, peace, joy and all the expressions of God’s universe. 

It is time for humanity to awaken to their true selves, to find their way beyond the illusions of the mind. How humanity has reveled in their mental concepts and expressions, and how humanity enjoys and affirms these capacities that God has given them. In this affirmation, you have all made the mind the primary source of truth, and it is not and never will be. The mind is meant to help humanity navigate the material world and to help humanity find all levels of understanding of truth. 

Yet, when humanity begins at the level of the material mind, it can go no further. It may, in certain circumstances, come to the mind of the soul in humility and grace and be opportunistic in understanding the perceptions and abilities of the soul mind, but it is not the beginning and end of the spiritual search and understanding of truth. It is only an appendage of the true source of truth, which is the soul. So, you must teach this. You must teach the journey of the soul. You must help others to go beyond being enamoured by the power of the material mind.

My beloved brothers and sisters, each of you have experienced your soul, have come to know the difference between the consciousness of mind and the consciousness of soul. So, what I say is not new to you. But I come to remind you and to encourage you upon your journey of service to God, for each of you have prayed to be of service. Many of you believe that when you serve God in a mindful way that, indeed, this is the capacity and limitations of your service. But I tell you there is more and greater service to God. 

When the material mind and the soul mind come closer and are willing to be integrated together, then the abilities and possibilities of service through soul and through material mind are greatly enhanced. The depth and breadth is realised to a degree, for this depth and breadth shall continue to grow forever. You are greatly blessed to know the truth as you know it. Express it, dear souls. Live it and seek out your souls forevermore, for you need to understand those deeper aspects of yourself and to be in alignment with them as you seek your alignment with God. 

God bless you, dear ones. I am Matthew. My love for you is great. God bless you and keep you in His Love and blessings of truth and light, joy and peace. God bless you.
