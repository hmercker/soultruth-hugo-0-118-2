# The Soul Is of Far Greater Capacity than the Material Mind

May the Love from on high, be yours. I am Aristotle and I believe that you all know of me, for my name has been registered in history as a philosopher, the one who brought mindful analysis to the world. Although in truth, I was only one of many. Yet, my efforts guided man along a road of intellectual reasoning and ideas. Thus, today you honour and even adore those with great intellects, those who continue to deduce truth through their minds. This process of deduction has led to a certain trajectory of human development and mindful considerations that bring you to your present day reality, your perceptions of the world.

Yet, those of you here who have ventured further beyond the intellectual constraints of the mind, seeking that of the soul, understand and realise that intellectual deduction is a very limited way of understanding the world. It is the perceptions and even the mind of the soul that go much further in understanding the world and understanding many things about the universe. For this mind is not limited and tethered by the material world. It expands and grows in accordance with God feeding it with His Essence. In this process, this blessing, you become not just more worldly, but you come to understand the universe more fully. You come to understand the Creator of the universe as your personal friend, giving blessings, giving comfort, giving guidance and giving truth to your soul.
The universe, in many ways, expands with the understanding and development of the soul and also becomes smaller with this development. It becomes smaller because the truth becomes simplified and, shall I say, manageable for the limitations that you carry at this time. Yet the potential of knowing the universe, of communicating with the universe, of understanding the intricacies of the universe, is possible as your soul mind expands and grows in love.

These things I did not understand at all when I walked the Earth. I was merely enamoured by the intellect, the capacities of the material mind. But all these years later, I see that the world is changing and that you, my friends, are an indication of that change. That you seek something higher and are indeed endowed with greater truth. I applaud you for this. I am grateful that you continue on in your pursuits of truth. For how does the world change but with the understanding of truth to the very depths of every individual’s being and knowing?
Yes, *"I think, therefore I am,"* but indeed, *"you feel, therefore you exist."* In that feeling, you exist within the realms of the soul and the soul existing in the realms of God, the great Oversoul. In these perceptions, what you understand, the truth that you have gleaned thus far through your life’s experience are the core of great truth and universal understanding. I hope that each of you realise that the journey that you have embarked upon is one of great magnitude and importance. Do not take this journey for granted, but make it a focus, the result of the deep desires of your soul, seeking the great truths of the universe. 

The way in which you are going about this is far superior to the ways that I went about this in my day. You have advanced beyond my expertise and gifts while on Earth. Although now I reside within the Celestial Kingdom and I understand these truths very well indeed and exercise them with every breath, although I do not have breath, since I am a spirit. Yet indeed, I come to encourage you upon your journey toward truth. I come to acknowledge you as you have stepped beyond the realms of intellectualism into the realms of the feeling soul, a soul that has great capacity to understand many things, far greater capacity than the material mind. You are well on your way, my beloved friends, upon a journey like none other, upon a journey so infused with truth that you will never end this journey, for it cannot end. It is infinite.

May you come to see yourselves with your feet planted upon a journey of truth, the blessings of love that bring this journey to you and allow you to understand it as you progress further. You are blessed, my beloved friends, truly. You have listened to the words of the Master who brings truth to humanity and to all who exist in this world. We are together as students of the truth of love. I walk with you as do many, many. We are unified in the great Truth of God, the great truths of the universe, understanding that the power of love is immense and is crucial to open the doors to understanding truth, to living truth and to being an example and an emanation of truth, light and love.
May you be blessed, my beautiful friends. I have come a long way to be with you. I am Aristotle and my love for you is great, beautiful souls, intrepid in your seeking of truth. May you be blessed and find what you are seeking for and awaken with each revelation, each understanding that God means for you to have, to know and to experience.

God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
