Andrew received by Al Fike

God bless you. It is difficult for us to make rapport today with this instrument because of the conditions and energies that are about this Earth. I am Andrew and my rapport with this instrument is great since I am his guide. So it is less difficult for me. I want you to know that Jesus is praying with you, beloveds, that many angels are praying with you at this time because the world needs your prayers, our prayers, God’s Touch so that there may be a transformational blessing upon the world.

Our brother indicates and affirms that there are great changes afoot and that this transition which we all pray for, has begun. It has been in the process for a number of years. In fact, if you look at the progression and history of humanity, the seeds of transformation began when our brother, Jesus, walked the Earth. The successive prophets and spiritual individuals who came after him have laid the groundwork for much to be seeded within the minds of men. Of course, the quality of these seeds, the blessings that have come with the efforts of many are varied. Some are in error and much is not in error. That which is predicated upon love is closest to God.

Thus, you honour women and mothers in your world. I ask you the question, “Who is closer to God?” More likely it is those women and mothers for they have a natural tendency towards love, whether that be the natural qualities combined with the Love of God. This makes a formidable force in the world, a force that has, in many regards, saved your world from greater pain and destruction. So, I honour all who are of light and love, all who seek for the blessings of God’s Love, all who express love in the myriad of ways that love may be expressed. For without love, humanity is lost and yet, within each and every soul is the capacity to love. God created humanity in love and to love. Some of you on the earthly plane make this a priority, a way of life and others are lost and alone and in darkness because they do not recognise the power of love.

You, my beloved friends, acknowledge this and make every effort to live by the Laws of Love and I acknowledge you, each of you. Blessed and beloved souls, that which you have manifest and nurtured within yourselves, that which God has manifest and nurtured within you, that which is the expression of your lives that brings light and truth and peace, I acknowledge this. I wish to encourage this. For in the transition that comes in the world, love will be the currency. Love will be the active agent that will do the transformation that will cause the changes that are intended by God. This plan is predicated on love, love for humanity, love for every soul. God has devised a plan that will open the gates, the doorway to love, greater love. All that is not of love, all that engenders pain, distortion, error and darkness will be expunged from the Earth. In this way, humanity will be given the opportunity to choose love and to see love for what it is, the power of love, the beauty of love, the graciousness of love and it is our hope that through free will, humanity will choose love above all else just as you have chosen love above all else.

I say to you, you are the forerunners, the harbingers of the new age that comes. Though you are imperfect and you struggle on this earthly plane, within your hearts, your souls are the burning embers of love that shall guide you forward. In this light you will be the examples. You will be the instruments. You will be that which will help nurture and guide your brothers and sisters. You are part of this plan. You are part of this plan to heal humanity, to help bring humanity beyond the error and the darkness into the light of day, the light of truth.

See yourselves in this way. See yourselves as God’s instruments, as channels of love and if you ask with each day to be God’s channels of love, to be that light of truth, then God will guide you and put you within these situations and conditions on your daily journey that will open the door to your instrumentalities, that will bring an opportunity forth that you may teach, heal, comfort and minister to your brothers and sisters. In this way the love spreads. In this way the love finds expression. In this way the love is predominant.

Think of your life as God’s blessing, an opportunity to serve. Think of service as an expression of love. Think of love as the very essence of God poured within your being thereby being the very essence within you, that you may express your true selves in ways and means that are in harmony with God’s Will and God’s Touch, a part of His plan for the salvation of humanity. Do not forsake your purpose, my friends, but see that God has made purpose within you, that God has given you great opportunities to serve in light and love to heal the world to be a light and example for the world.

Each of you is blessed in this way and there are many more. As the word spreads, as the truth is given, as the love is blessed within the soul, the changes begin and those changes will cover the world and bless and heal the world. May you be blessed, beloved souls, in this gracious Touch of God. May you know His Love as the power, force and impetus of your being, your expression on Earth. May you know the joys of this, the wonderment, the revelations of truth, the great peace that passes understanding, all that God has to give to you, my beloved friends. It awaits you. It awaits you. Knock on the door and ask that the blessings flow, the great flow of God’s Touch upon you, uplifting you, awakening you, showing your the way, bringing all manner of angels in your midst, all light and truth given to you freely. This is the manifestation of God’s Love for you. It is great and holy and awesome in its expression.

We are being blessed at this time. May each soul open readily and completely to God’s Touch, that your minds may acquiesce to your souls, the feelings and experiences within. May you know peace, my beloved friends, the peace of love, the peace that passes all understanding which is God’s presence in the form of His Holy Spirit. God bless you. I am Andrew and I love you. I love you dearly, my brothers and sisters on Earth. You are loved and never alone. God bless you. God bless you.
