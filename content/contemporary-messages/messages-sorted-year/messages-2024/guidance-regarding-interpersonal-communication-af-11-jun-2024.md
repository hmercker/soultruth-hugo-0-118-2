The pathway to light is open to you, beloved souls. The Holy Spirit of God’s great Soul touches each one of you, opening the door to your souls, opening the door to all that can come with the great Love of God. I am Aaron and I come to encourage you.

We are all on a journey, are we not? Each of us on our personal journey towards God and at-onement with the Creator. Together we journey to serve God, to bring the truth of God’s Love to the world. There are those who join you, this group who supports you, who include you in their prayers. These individuals are not only on the earthly plane but in spirit, in the high realms of spirit, in the Celestial Kingdom. Many join you as you continue to seek out the ways and means that you can serve God.

It is important that you try to do so with humility, simplicity and grace. There is no need for complex ideas and concerns that are of the mind. For the ways of the soul are simple indeed. The understanding and perceptions of the soul may be complex, but to try and translate these things into words and mindful concepts only leads one astray from the purity of God’s Touch upon your soul’s consciousness. Absorb whatever experiences you may have, integrate them into your consciousness. Be true to those things, but do not feel obligated to share these insights with others unless you are guided to do so. For God gives you these blessings of insight and experience for the goodness of your own journey, to inform your journey, to bring you closer to your Creator.

When you feel a need to share and speak of these things and yet they are not meant to be shared, you do yourself a disservice. You create a vortex of misunderstanding, sometimes, even jealousy and anger. When you are meant to share, you will know it, feel it and express it in the simple and beautiful terms that are of the soul. Do not walk beyond the limitations of God’s Will acting through you but listen intently. Listen with the yearnings of your soul to find the ways and means of teaching and sharing the truth of God’s Love.

Without the experiences that you all have had upon this journey, how could others understand? How could others truly know what you are speaking of? Even the language you use is foreign to many. Do not think that others will be able to follow your speech, your sharing. Rather when you are being God’s instruments, it is best to listen to them tell their stories, their insights. For you well know within you are higher and deeper insights and knowledge.

At times you feel it is important to correct another in their error. When you feel the affirmation to do so, then follow through with your feelings and intentions. Yet, when it is merely a mindful and ego-based intention, then control these impulses, my beloved friends, because they do not create connection between you and another. They create disconnection and disharmony. Your soul in its light, its vibrancy, its expression will do more to help uplift and assist the individual than any words you can say. If words complement this light expressed, that indeed is a great blessing to both of you. When you force the issue, it does not do justice to the opportunity that God has placed before you to serve your brothers and sisters.

Be circumspect in your speech, your sharing and your insights. Be loving and kind. Indeed, be truthful to yourself. When within you, you discern error that is being spoken, but you know that the individual who speaks it is not interested in hearing your insights, then I suggest you pray for that individual and move on. Be loving at all times and all cases and situations. When you see serious harm being done, if there is an opportunity to act to diffuse the negativity and divert the dark actions intended, then God will be with you. We will be with you and help you in this.

There are times when you may put yourself in jeopardy and act foolishly, foolhardy in a situation that is violent and dangerous. Yes, you may receive protection, but there are times when even we cannot circumvent the will of another who is indeed violent. This is where your gift of discernment comes into play. This is where it is important to choose your efforts, even choose where you will walk, what places you will frequent if there is a sense that there is danger, difficulty and negativity and that we are there to help you. Change what route or decision you have made. Then heed the help of the angels and the blessings of God.

As times in your world get darker, as changes in your world come, this discernment will do you well. This carefulness of how you conduct yourself in the world is crucial. God will put you in places and connect you with individuals that are most important for you to be used as an instrument to help and uplift. Listen to the promptings of your soul. Put aside the temptations of your mind and be in the peace and grace of God’s touch, that His Love may inform everything in your life. As you grow in this Love so the ease of guiding and informing will come and you will not be confused or misguided. You will be blessed with peace, blessed with insight, blessed with wisdom and discernment and most of all, blessed with a sense of love and well-being for all you meet. 

May you be blessed in this light, my beautiful friends. I am with you often and shall continue to be with you. I am Aaron and I love you all so much. God bless you.
