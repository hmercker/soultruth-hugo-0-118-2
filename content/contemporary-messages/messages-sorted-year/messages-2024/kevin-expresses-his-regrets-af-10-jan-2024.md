Yes, I am not an angel either. All too human in my time on Earth, full of many flaws, indulgences, and fears, all the human things. But the gatekeepers have allowed me to come to you to speak, to encourage you. Because I must say that, since coming over to this side of life I have many regrets, that I could have done more for the work that is needed. Yes, I dedicated myself in ways that were safe and that I felt capable of. But I must say that there were many things I could have done, many gifts that were not explored and expressed. 

I do have regrets. Yet the one great triumph in my life was that I understood the power of Divine Love to heal me and to bring me to God. So, in my prayers I found a measure of redemption and understanding of the truth, and this I am very happy to say I have found the light and greater truth. I have gone to speak to many of the friends that we share together that have passed over and they too have found light and truth. Like me, they have their regrets that they could have done more. No doubt when you pass over you will feel the same.

I want to encourage you to push the envelope to do more than you think you can do, to get beyond that place of comfort to a place where you challenge yourself and are in greater harmony with God and God’s Will. For God has placed in you countless gifts and abilities. God has in line for you countless possibilities and opportunities. Take them up. Seize the day. Do not falter and dither about as I did. But be strong and clear and truly dedicate your life to this. For you are needed, as you know, you are needed. Do not worry about the small details, the technical things, all those things that would drive me crazy.

Instead look at the bigger picture and know that as you progress in love, all the details will sort themselves out. The big efforts, God’s plan is what is important. You will find yourself in the middle of it, working clearly and succinctly toward accomplishing this great plan that God has set forth for humanity. You well know, as I did, that many, many, many on the Earth are lost. Let’s face it, many will continue to be lost. But there are many who are seeking, who are looking for light and truth. These are the ones you must open yourselves to, even if you feel you are being silly or inappropriate. 

Opening to strangers is not easy, it certainly wasn’t for me. Indeed, if you are guided to connect with a stranger, do so. The only one that I know that does this without hesitation sits to my right here (J). Take her as your example.  You dear Jeanne are a great example to me and to many. Don’t forget your gifts. Don’t underestimate them. Yes, certain personalities that have their ways and their gifts  makes this easier. But each of you have a way, an expression of your unique self that, if given in an elegant and sufficient way will be acceptable to others. Just to say to somebody *“you are loved. You are loved.”* How many feel that in the world? 

This is an important truth, to say to others that they are loved and that the greatest love of all, the most love that they could possibly know comes from God. And also, that you love them. Because in your heart when you have Divine Love in sufficient amounts, you love everybody. You may see certain flaws, aspects of personality that you do not find lovable, but in your heart, you love everybody. It’s a different kind of love, isn’t it? It is an important and powerful love that needs to be known in the world, and that people can have the choice to know this love, to feel it and to be healed by it. I was healed by it, you are being healed by it.  We are taking the journey of that healing, of knowing truly how we are loved. 

So, as dear Augustine, who kind of scares me, says, *“you must be that light in the world, that channel of love in the world.”* Keep trying, my friends. Keep trying to be that light in the world. If you do so well, you won’t have the regrets I have. You will be full of joy and appreciation of what you have done for God. Isn’t this what it is all about? Our appreciation for being created by God and loved by God. The expression of that is to love and appreciate others in all the ways that we can, serve others in all the ways that we can. 

I have said enough, and I thank you Albert for allowing me to say these worlds. I know I don’t do so in the eloquent ways of the angels, but I think you get my drift. Know that I appreciate the work that you do, that all of you do. You are the brave ones. You set forth in those places in the world that I would turn my nose up to and think, *“oh no, I couldn’t do that.”* But you’re doing it and I take my hat off to you and I don’t take my hat off for many.

So, here we are. I love you. I love everybody and I want to be a light for everyone. So do you, my friends, so do you. Blessings to you. Your friend, Kevin.

Jeanne: I love you, Kevin. You made my day.

Kevin: Jeanne, you make my day every day. Blessings to you too and the rest of you. God bless you. Love and light. Love and light. God bless you.
