# Orchestrate Love 

February 29<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your brother in the love of God, Judas. My friends, let me thank you for coming together in this way, for exploring the frontiers of the spirit world through these many writings, through these many receivings. We are overjoyed at your efforts and as always, we are at your beck and call. 
   
I would like you to consider for a moment or two how a symphony might work together. There is generally a conductor who could be seen as a facilitator, sometimes selecting the work or works to be played but not playing an instrument. Sometimes working with a particular musician who is being honored or who is featured, perhaps playing a piece that they’ve written, but more likely performing a piece that is well known, and working with every section of the orchestra, both in groups and individually to create a piece of great beauty, of power and of majesty. 

Everyone has a job to do from perhaps the one who is considered the lowly triangle player to the first-chair violin or trumpeter and yet everyone forms an integral part of the whole. Everyone is playing the same song. Everyone is contributing their uniqueness and so I can see you know what I’m leading up to which is your orchestra and the many sections and individuals that make up the Divine Love community. When you come together in a single prayer, asking for God’s love, there is beautiful music. 

And yet, each one has an individual part to play, each one a unique life. You have chosen the songs of God’s love to play on your heartstrings, to resonate through your souls, that you may send out, each one, a piece of the magnificence of this gift, of this song, the great song of God’s love that carries with it a golden light and emanates all the colors on your earth spectrum and beyond. 
  
Please know that whenever you come together, there is an opportunity for this blessing to be radiated out, not only upon the earth, but into the spirit world that you’re all reading about and will someday be your home. Rest in gratitude. Rest in the peace and blessing of every moment in communion with God, in the Holy presence beyond time and space and in the flow of eternity. 

My dear friends, may this blessing be yours. With all my love, I thank you for taking this message. May the songs in your souls delight the world and bring peace to all. God bless you. I am Judas, your brother and friend in the celestial heavens and I love you.
