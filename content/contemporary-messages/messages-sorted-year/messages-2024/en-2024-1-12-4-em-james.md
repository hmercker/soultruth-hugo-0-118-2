# The Light in Your Souls Ignites Many Souls on this Island

January 12<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Barbados

James received by Elizabeth Mack

I am James, your brother and I come to speak before you as one whose love from the Father is great and one who comes before you to pray with you and for you. For you are mighty group as one in soul. As my brother has said, you have much to offer those upon this island and this Earth of your souls, brothers, of your souls, the love that you bring into your souls and yes, you allow that to happen by opening your souls and allowing God to touch you deeply, profusely and you will make many changes upon this part of the Earth among the people here who truly desire to move forward in their progressions towards God.

I see that it will not take much to ignite the flame of God’s love here upon this island. You are the sparks. Your souls carry the flame. You are entrusted with this mission, each of you and all of you together. May the Father bless you in this mission. May God elevate you and raise that flame within you. May you feel this flame growing within you and may you serve your brothers and sisters upon this island and other places on behalf of your Father. May God bless you. May God teach you and help you as one. I am your brother; James the Apostle and I thank you for allowing me to speak to you so frankly. God bless you. God bless you all in this circle. May God’s love grow deeply within you.
