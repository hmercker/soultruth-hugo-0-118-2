# Closing Circle Poughkeepsie Retreat

September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA

Augustine received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am your brother. Truly your brother, I am known as St. Augustine. I have come back now that you are ready and I wish to bless this congregation of souls, those seen and unseen, at the end of this very auspicious retreat. For you have touched many lives, many souls and more will be coming. For your work is not yet finished, as you know well. Each of you, each of you has purpose. Each of you will be touching lives as you go about your business, your daily business. Remember, keep your souls open and let the love flow out to each soul. You do not need to talk to them as they pass by. Just keep your souls open and say a little prayer for each one.

You have worked hard. Of course, you are blessed for the work that you have done thus far, but do not rest. For you have more work, more surprises, more love to share in the coming days. I speak to each one of you, each one of you. The world is full of souls searching for what you have attained. Feel compassion for them. Reach out to them with your love. Give them that experience and if they ask, let them know. Your borders are open. We will come again. My love is with you. I am Augustine and we will come again.
