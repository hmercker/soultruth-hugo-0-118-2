John the Beloved received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am John, John the Beloved. I see amongst this flock of souls, bright lights, souls that are resplendent in the great gift of God’s Love. Souls that are dedicated to pursuing the Truth of God’s Love, to awaken their beautiful beings as the Essence of God continues to flow within them. In this pursuit of truth, the awakening of your soul, you are becoming great lights in the world. Indeed, it does not require accolades and recognition from those who have power in this world, for many of those individuals are lost and ignorant as to what true power is. Rather, you come humbly to God and you seek the grace that is His Love. You are empowered by love. You are empowered by truth. Indeed, your lives do not reflect great ambition and desire for recognition. Rather, the only recognition that is important to you is the recognition of God in your life and in your soul. So, it is with you, beloved souls. So, it is.

Indeed, with humility, grace and the empowerment of love, you become formidable, beautiful and an agent of change in the world. How will the world change? Not by the edicts and ministrations of those with mindful intentions and desires to hold sway over many. They are lost human influences and desires that, in time, will no longer hold sway upon the Earth. A new era of love is about to be in your world. You are discovering what that means for your own personal world and life. In this discovery, in trying to bring into alignment all of this truth and all of the beauty of your soul in love and light toward a life that is in harmony with God’s laws, you become the example, beloveds. You are the example.

I encourage you to continue upon this road, to be dedicated, to be true to what you know to be true. Be humble in ways where you may be tempted to be forceful and to apply your will upon a situation. Rather, go to God and allow God’s Will to be implied wherever you are and whatever you are doing. It will be a force for light andl bring peace and harmony. These are the markers of truth. Where there is peace, there is God. Where there is harmony, there is the free flow of God’s laws acting together and bringing harmonious conditions. When the many dilemmas of human life are encountered, God brings to you solutions. God imbues within you wisdom and perception of the soul so that you may truly find your way through these conditions.

You seek to be an individual that brings light, truth, love, healing and peace into the world. Rather than be the individual that implies these things through mental and metaphysical means, of which there are many who do so, you have found another way, a way more powerful, a way that is higher in intention and expression, the way of the soul rather than the mind. I applaud you, beloved souls. I applaud you for your efforts. When these two approaches collide together, as they may often do in this physical world of yours, take the higher road, beloveds.

Ask for guidance. Ask to be used as a channel of love, wisdom and truth in the world. Put aside those aspects of yourself that would insist upon a mindful approach and the security of well-worn habits of thought and expression. Seek for the high road, the way of love, that which often is unfamiliar and not gratifying to the mind. But oh, the soul becomes further liberated from the shackles of old thought and action toward that which is free, expansive and filled with love and truth. For God resides there. God is with you there. God shall guide you forward from that place of soul awakening and soul understanding.

Each of you have some insights and inklings of that place. I urge you to continue to nurture that place, to make efforts within your prayers and your daily life to be in alignment with that place which reflects the Will of God, the Love of God, the wisdom of God. That is the place you must go, my beautiful and beloved souls, children of God, all of you. For in your efforts to be in alignment with the truth, to be in alignment with the Laws of Love and the Will of God, you will find yourself as an effective and powerful leader in the world. It may not be the world of great happenstance and conditions of power that is common to those who are motivated by the mind. It will be the world that is of the common man struggling with the common condition. Those who are seeking solace and comfort, those who are in pain, those who are lost. You will be a powerful influence to assist them upon their journey toward greater light and truth. Because of your love and condition, expression thereof, they will listen to you and they will be comforted by you. You will help to empower them to find their way toward light, joy and peace, just as you have struggled and found your way.

Be God’s instruments, beloved souls. Be true to what your souls know in their recognition and experience with God. Knowing His Love as the change agent within that will bring you deeper insights into truth and greater pathways toward joy and expression of the wisdom and gifts of your soul. You are each blessed. You are each upon the road toward greater truth and greater light. I come to encourage you upon that road to be truly a light. A light that shall be God’s instruments without inhibition, without conditions that would inhibit and divert the light. Be truly free from all those human things and truly a light, a soul redeemed in Love.

God bless you, beloveds. I am John and I love you, love you dearly. God bless you. God bless you.
