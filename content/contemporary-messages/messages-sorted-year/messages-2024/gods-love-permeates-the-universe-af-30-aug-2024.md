Good evening to you, my friends. I am Yogananda. God’s Love is available throughout the universe. It is available to every soul that inhabits the universe and there are many, my beloved friends. There are many. No matter the perspective, no matter where that soul resides, no matter the life experience and the mindful considerations that inhabit that individual’s consciousness, if they ask for this gift, this great gift of God’s Essence, then they will receive its blessing. For God’s Love knows no bounds, nor any restrictions. It is available to every soul who asks for it. 

Indeed since there are many billions upon billions of souls in the universe, God is kept very busy answering these prayers. Although as you well know, it is not Him who answers, but it is the manifestation of His Spirit that is in contact with all of God’s children. The consciousness of God is unfathomable and yet, it is present for every soul to know, to speak to and to have a conversation with. God has provided all means by which an individual soul may come into alignment with the Divine. You have made yourself available to God. You have come to be with God, to seek out God and to know God. We come together in these humble circles to acknowledge this desire and to put forth this desire in the ways and means that are prescribed. 

As simple as they are, still you must ask, you must focus, you must desire and you must open yourself to the inflowing of God’s Essence. These are simple requirements. For everything in the universe requires laws to be fulfilled, actions that are in harmony and alignment with the way in which the universe works. You have found your way to a simple, yet most powerful truth. Indeed, I know that each one of you has practised and repeated again and again these prayers, this time to be with the Creator. I applaud you, beautiful souls, for your efforts and for your practice. Indeed, there are many, many practices of spirituality in your world. Yet there is only one simple application that will bring this gift and truth into your being. Despite all the options, all the distractions, your soul has led you directly to the truth. You have come to acknowledge this together with one another in humility, in loving grace, in joy and in truth. So, we are together in this Circle of Light, this place of prayer, this longing, longing that is set forth to God.

Indeed time and distance mean nothing when it comes to this. For when you set forth a true and abiding prayer to God, God hears this instantaneously and responds just as quickly to your desire in prayer. As I have said, there are no limitations, nothing that will set back the fulfilment of this Law of Love. I urge you to seek. Seek out God. Seek out the Essence of God, His Love and you will find the fulfilment like none other. You will know a place within that is true, intimate and powerful. The truths and wonderment of God’s creation, God’s universe will be set before you, a feast for the soul. All will come in accordance with your faith, desire and effort. 

May you be blessed, beloved friends, in the truth of the Love of God and truly know this Love well so that you may not have any doubts or confusion, but have clarity, understanding and grace. Blessings to you, my beloved friends. I am Yogananda and I love each of you so very much, so very much. You are each my friend and I am yours upon the journey of truth. Blessings to you. Blessings to all.
