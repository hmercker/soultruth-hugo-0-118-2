# A Lesson on Following Guidance

God bless you, beloved students, I am your teacher Augustine. There are times when we ask you to bend, but not to break. We will not take you to that point, but indeed, when one is in service, there is sacrifice involved. You speak of harmony, but do you speak of the harmony that comes with a sense of contentment, compliance or complacency that brings pleasure? There are times when you are in service, when it is not always pleasurable but necessary. There are times when you are in service and you feel uplifted and deeply blessed. But we do not bring you to a situation of pain and discomfort purposefully. It is your resistance and your condition that often brings this pain, discomfort and frustration. These are all conditions of the material plane and the material mind. When you are in harmony with God, then all else flows in harmony with you.  

So, you must ask yourself, when you make the statement *“this is not in harmony,”* is this a reflection of your own condition, or is this a reflection of true harmony? Do not use this phrase in such a way that it is a foil for everything that you do and gives a rationale for your own discomfort. You will be uncomfortable at times. Being in harmony with God’s Laws of Love can often bring discomfort and can often bring its challenges. But when you reach that place of harmony with that which is of God’s Laws of Love, then even the discomfort will be accepted and desired.

You have free will, beloved students. You can choose every moment. God gives you this gift. But I warn you that if you utilise your own mind’s judgments about what is in harmony and what is not, then you are missing the point. Guidance is given as an open door for an individual to walk through in service. There is no punishment if that individual refuses to walk through that door. Merely, God will present other doors to walk through. Yet indeed, often the first guidance is the clearest and the most direct route. When the individual uses their minds to ameliorate, continuing to reform and manipulate that guidance, it becomes less clear and less direct. 
 
It is important for you to honour the guidance that is given and to find a way to execute that guidance in the clearest, most direct form. Because you live upon the Earth plane, often there are obstructions and conditions that are difficult to navigate. This is where you have the assistance of your angel friends to help you to navigate these conditions. Indeed, if you are committed to the plan and Will of God, then a way will be found and an opportunity will be given. Have faith in this. Have faith in your capacity to do what is intended. God will never ask you to do something that you cannot do. God will merely help to support you and uplift you in that which you can do.  

It is a matter of faith, a matter of understanding the soul’s inclinations, desires and understanding of God’s Will. This collaboration between you and God is what brings about the fulfilment of God’s plan and God’s Will. Do not doubt yourselves. Indeed, you will find that there will be times when you wonder, “why, why have I done this? Why am I going in this direction? Why is this not feeling pleasurable, but difficult?” These are the times when the mind is resisting and the soul is in the background cheering you on toward the endpoint of that goal, that guidance. 

Be sure of your guidance, beloved souls. Try not to mix your mindful judgments and perceptions with your soulful knowings. In this way, you can never go wrong. Yes, certain obstructions may loom before you and negative forces are always working to undo the Will of God. When you have great faith, however, and walk along the road intended, you will be protected. Even when there are obstructions, you will be guided around them and all will be in harmony.

My beautiful and beloved lights, students of the truth, continue to make your plans. Continue to have your ideas and even your concerns, but always, always bring these things to God in prayer. For the solution will come in this way. You will find that God will find a way for you. Your angel friends will escort you along that way and there will be harmony, fulfilment and the expression of God’s Will in all that you do.  

May you be blessed, beloved souls, upon the journeys that you take, upon the relationships that you make along the way of your life. May you be blessed. Your teacher Augustine loves you. May the Love of God continue to infill your soul to the point where it will overshadow all doubts, all judgments and bring to you peace, the peace that passes all understanding. In this way, everything that you are guided to do will be seen clearly and the execution of it will be done directly and in harmony.  

God bless you, beloved students. Your teacher Augustine loves you and I will continue to escort you on your journeys of soul awakening, of gleaning the wisdom and the truth that comes with the soul that is in harmony with God. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I love you.
