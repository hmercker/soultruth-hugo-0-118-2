# Welcomes All to the Love Boat Cruise

August 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Love Boat Tour, Alaska, USA

Augustine received by Al Fike

We welcome you to this fortuitous group. I am your teacher, Augustine. You benefit greatly when you come together in a group such as this, praying together in the flesh, seeking the great gift of God’s Love into your souls, bringing the angels close to each one of you. We form this Circle of Light together. As a Circle of Light, so the benefits of these blessings will come with intensity and effectiveness, rising you up into the higher spheres of consciousness, opening your souls wide to the great gifts of God’s Love infilling, transforming and uplifting.

As you continue to find your way, seeking to develop your soul, you benefit from each other's presence. The gifts that each carry and the sharing of those gifts with one another. You love one another. You uphold one another. You affirm and reassure one another that you are, indeed, upon a journey that is not a singular journey, but one taken by your brothers and sisters. When you come together in this way, you feel the fraternity, a family of love that you are a part of. Though it takes you great efforts to come together, God provides the way, opens the door and you are gifted with this loving family.

My beloved friends, students of truth, we shall continue to uphold you. We shall continue to be conduits of blessings for you and continue to love you. God’s presence is amongst you that you may know the peace that passes all understanding. That you may know the comfort that comes with His Touch. That you may be close, not only with one another, but with God. These blessings come to each one of you and shall continue as you journey together in this short time.

God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine, and my love is with you all. As you open, open wide to the gift of God’s Love. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
