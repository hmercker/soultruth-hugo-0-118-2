# The Grace of God's Essence Comes with Responsibility

June 13<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Maureen Cardoso

I stand before my disciples, whose souls are growing in the light of God. Whose souls are illuminated with the brilliance of the Creator’s Essence, whose souls long to be in union with their Maker. You are my disciples.

Remember, beloved souls, you are created in the image of God. The very origin of your soul is created with the attributes of God. You are being purified, cleansed and transformed. These original attributes of love, peace, power, joy, wisdom, and more are part of what you are made of. So, when you pray for peace, you must be peace. To have the peace within you be activated and strengthened, for the love within you to be activated and strengthened. It's the same as joy.

All these attributes are at the very core of your being. Choose to express and live through these qualities of your true nature. Stand firm in the face of the human condition within you and release these conditions to the Heavenly Father to be transformed into divine qualities.

When you pray for the grace of God’s Essence to flow into your soul, it comes with a certain degree of responsibility - being able to respond through this loving essence that lives in you - being strong enough to push away the darkness that is within and allow these divine qualities to inform and pulse through your life and to shine through you. It is the path that you have chosen, is it not? You have chosen to be beacons of light in this world, and each of you is. But when you struggle, beloved souls, this is where your divine strength must be exercised. Know that the light is always greater in the face of any darkness. Light outshines darkness; a great power grows within you as God’s Essence flows into your soul. Your relationship and your union with God transform, develops and establishes itself in a profound way that draws you, again and again, to return, opening your soul to more of this glorious Love.

When you experience such things as impatience, know that within you, there is patience. You only need to go a little deeper within your being, in that stillness, in that burning fire of love and draw out the quality of patience - the same as courage, the same as faith, the same as joy. For your nature, your true nature is these qualities. Return to your true self. Return to truth. The truth that you have been made in the image of. This has never left you. Yet, under the influence of darkness and the shadows of humanity, you sometimes forget, but remember, my beloved disciples, it has always been there.

When you pray for God’s Love within the soul, you awaken to these extraordinary qualities that are you. God’s Love imbues, strengthens, embellishes, and transforms your imagery into divinity - a substance solidified in God.

Drink deep of these living waters, beloved souls. Allow that which distracts you to be washed and purified into pristine soul qualities and illuminated and sparkle in God’s Light and substance of Love.  Allow this all to come and transform you into the grace of God’s Light and Love, merging at one with your Creator.

I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens, your brother, your friend. God bless you, each of you. God bless you.
