Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

My beloved and beautiful friends, I am Seretta Kem. As your lives become busier, your engagements more often, then I know it will be difficult for you to establish hard and fast rules, dates and times in order to do this work. Rest assured that we will plow the field for you so that there are opportunities and that you will have ample time to do your work and to connect with these dear and beautiful souls who are seeking to serve God in this way.

Each of you is also being developed in the ways and forms of your gifts. You must consider the as you are participating in these groups. Development, expansion of soul gifts has no limitation. As you grow in the Fatherâ€™s Love, as you continue to awaken to this Love and it awakens you, then various gifts will emerge. Having the support and fellowship of this group that you have formed together will become an important component in your life and the way that you are opening. Having support, having love, having guidance given, all these things work toward the benefit of your opening and awakening many ways.

So, you continue to forge bonds, work together. That will indeed help to forge further bonds and further ventures forward as you are guided, ready and prepared for the service that God has placed before you, that which at this time you may not know of, but will come, will emerge in its proper time. You will find yourself relying on your friends, your cohorts in this great journey of soul awakening and service to your brothers and sisters.

There is still much work to do. There is much work to do regarding your fellowship, your mediumship group. They will be having their own experiences, and these experiences will lead to discussions and queries as to what is happening to them. You must guide them to look within their souls to look to God and to look to one another. It is important that they are not overly dependent upon your perceptions, opinions and ideas as to their particular journey. Although we are certainly happy that you contribute your time and perceptions for their benefit. It is important that you encourage them to seek on their own the development of their gifts. Because each individual is unique, that journey will be unique to them. They must have faith in God, faith in their angel friends, faith in their own soul and its awakening. This way, no matter what happens in their lives and to this world of yours, that development of independence, creating attitudes and conditions within them that makes them strong and are able to stand on their own. They will be able to weather any storms that might come. It is a great luxury for each to gather in this place of light, to have the opportunity to do so, but that opportunity will not always be there. So, we must ensure the strengthening of your bonds, the strengthening of their capacity to perceive and develop independently and strengthen their bonds with God first and foremost.

There is much work to do, beloved souls. We will continue. You will continue and we will all work together to help uplift humanity, to help uplift your brothers and sisters, those with whom you have established a powerful bond of love. It is important that you keep these individuals in your prayers and in your mind to help to enliven these threads of light, this Lattice of Light that is created. Continue as you are guided and as you feel is appropriate. We will be close, and we will guide. We will assist you along the way, the journey that has been designated and blessed by God. God bless you beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. My love for you is great. My appreciation for your time and effort is great. We will proceed, beloved souls. We will proceed. God bless you. God bless you, my beloved friends, whom I love dearly.
