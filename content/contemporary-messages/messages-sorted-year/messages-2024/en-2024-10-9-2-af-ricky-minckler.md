Ricky Minckler received by Al Fike

I am Rick Minckler. I see clearly now. Oh, how I see much more clearly than I did. How I longed to see this clearly of what the life in the spirit world is like. Now I see and I have been given the privilege of being here amongst you to see the angels as they are and how beautiful they are, how awesome in their countenance. How blessed I am to know this and see this and to be with you. Do not worry for me. My passing was easy and I did not suffer. I feel great relief by not being in my burdened body, that heavy flesh that I carried. Indeed, my endeavours and my pursuits have helped me to adjust quickly to this life and to be in harmony with my next chapter in life. I believe that you, my dear friends, helped me along that road to a degree.

So, I thank you and I will continue to observe you all and see where this takes me, this new life of mine so free of all that troubled me. I do feel the joy and the exultation of this freedom, this being in the life of spirit. So, I thank you. I have not moved on yet to my place of habitation, but I sense that it is close and it is in the light. So, I will keep you informed as I progress. Thank you to the angels for allowing me to speak to you. Thank you for befriending me and the times that we had together. I cherish those times, for I was often very lonely and you filled some of that loneliness in with light and friendship. I appreciate that and I thank you again. Thank you, my friends. Thank you for all that you do. Thank you for the light that you are. As I said, I see clearly now how beautiful your lights are. God bless you, as you would say. God bless you.
