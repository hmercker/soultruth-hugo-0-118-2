# The Light Around You Continues to Brighten

Peter received by Al Fike

The light brightens around you all, beloved souls. I am Peter, known as Peter the Rock. I come to you from a distance away. Indeed, where I reside there is harmony and peace the likes of which you could not imagine. Each of you, as your light brightens, as your souls continue to be fed by the Living Waters of God’s Love, as you seek this with all earnestness and desire, you will someday find your place within the Celestial Heavens. For this is the road toward this place, as was taught by our beloved and beautiful brother, Jesus.

Without his teachings, without him opening that door, you would still be on the path that would lead to the paradise of the natural love rather than that which is beyond this paradise, in greater paradise, greater beauty, greater love. As your souls are awakened with the Essence of God, so your capacity to know the joy, the truth, the upliftment, all the many wonders of God come closer to you and are available to you.

My beloved friends, so many in your world continue to be weakened by the condition of darkness that surrounds your world. They are lost. They are often desperate. Often, they feel alone without the love that their souls long for. Yet, you have found your way out of these conditions which each of you, in your own way, have experienced at certain times in your life. You have found the way to heal these wounds, to infill your soul, to make the substance of your soul real and powerful in the Love of God, His Essence infilling you and changing you, transforming you and blessing you.

Be that light in the world, beloved souls. As you are changed by love, may love flow through you to change others, to inspire them to make that step closer to God and to ask for this gift. You have a simple formula and a simple truth to give. I urge you to do so. When you are given the opportunity by God to speak, to heal, to uplift and to bless, may you honour that and be focused upon it in whatever way that God wishes for you to enact His Will. As you focus and pray to know, to hear, to absorb and be aware of the Will of God, then the way will open. The way in which you must act will be clear. God will bless you with whatever you require to be that instrument for Him and for another, and possibly many at one time.

You do not know the Will of God every moment, but we wish for you to be in alignment with His Will so that you will know it. That you will understand what it is to be an instrument, a channel of love for God. These things come as you grow, as your soul awakens. As your perceptions become more acute and deep, so you will understand, so you will be motivated and impressed to do God’s Will. We are there to assist you in this, for we know God’s Will very well indeed.

This is what brings us to you. It is God’s Will that we surround you, each one with an angel close. You are in bright light, protection and love. This is God’s Will for you. That you may be blessed indeed. That the depth and breadth of that blessing may increase as you continue to grow in Love. By the Laws of Attraction and the Laws of Progression, you will be blessed more deeply, more powerfully as you walk this path toward at-onement with God.

Yes, someday you will know the glories of Heaven. Yet, in the interim, you will know the glories of God’s Touch upon you while you walk the Earth. You will know the beauty and light of the spirit spheres as you enter therein. Indeed, God has a great plan for each one of you. God will show you the way. God will help you to understand, to know, to envision, to feel and to express all that which is of God. Your souls have this capacity. Allow that to be so in your consciousness, in your daily life, knowing that God is close and you are close to God. To be His instrument and to do so effectively, clearly and lovingly in the world.

God asks much of you. Yet, God gives you much in order to be His instruments, in order to be a light, in order to be in harmony with His Laws of Love. So, I beseech you, my beloved friends on Earth to seek ye the Kingdom. Seek the truth. Knock on that door of truth and it shall open to you. All good and wondrous blessings shall come and befall upon you, beloved souls. You will find your way upon a path so resplendent in light and love that you will cry out in hosannas, praises of God. For you have been blessed and shall be blessed forevermore.

Beloved souls who seek, who wonder, who pray and beseech God for His blessings, I know the world is a difficult place. Indeed, your needs are great. But when you place your needs at God’s feet, they are a trifling to God. His ability to answer your prayers and to bless you is unlimited. He does not withhold. When prayers are given in earnestness and sincerity, He does not withhold. Though the answers to those prayers may not be as you envision, those answers are what are in harmony with God’s creation and God’s plan for you.

When you recognise God’s answer to prayer, be grateful. Be humble and be joyful, for in this you know that God knows you. In this, you know that God loves you. In this, you are well on your way, and the Path of Love is before you. The journey is joyful, beloved souls. The journey that you walk upon is meant for you alone. It is crafted and blessed by God for you in Love, in His desire that you find your way utilising the uniqueness of your soul, the gifts of your soul, the desires of your soul to find your way upon this path that will lead someday to at-onement with Him.

May you be blessed as you walk, my beloved and beautiful children of God. May you be blessed in peace. May you be blessed in Love. May you be blessed in upliftment and joy. May the truth and wisdom of your soul emerge into your consciousness. May you know the consciousness of God within your life and being.

I am Peter and my love is with you, beloved souls. I pray for your blessings and upliftment. I pray that God shall, indeed, send His Holy Spirit to awaken each of your souls. That may pour in His Love in all the richness and fullness that is to benefit and be given to you, my beloved and beautiful children. You are uplifted in Light, and you shall be blessed accordingly.

God bless you. My love is with you. Know that I pray for God’s children on Earth to know the light, peace, joy and truth that is meant for each one in your world and for each spirit in the spirit world. This gift is offered and shall not be withdrawn from you, beloveds, but shall carry you through the gates of Heaven. God bless you. God bless you all, beloved souls. Peter loves you.
