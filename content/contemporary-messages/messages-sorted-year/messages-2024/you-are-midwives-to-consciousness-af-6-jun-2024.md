I am Keea Atta Kem. In a way you are being the midwives to birthing soul consciousness within each individual who will be participating. This is what is required to help guide the individual to that place that they may confidently enter and do so over and over again, not only a place where they may be with God and know God, but also a place where we may be with them and for them to know us. In this way, as this relationship grows, each individual will find the ways and means of allowing our communications. They will feel comfortable and confident with what  may come through, what may come into their consciousness, what may come through them as instruments for the Celestial Angels.

They must understand that it is in soul development through receiving the great gift of Divine Love that this consciousness is formed, this avenue is opened and the door is opened to them so that they are in harmony with what is needed and what is required to be that individual who subscribes to be a channel for us, for God, for love, for light, for truth. All of these things are intertwined. Some have the great capacity for mediumship, others for vision, others for understanding and knowing truth in such a way that they may express this to others.

It matters not to us the direction in which that gift may go. What matters is that the gift is opened, the possibility of the flow of this connection between God’s Soul and your soul, between your soul and our soul, may be forged in such a way that the links cannot be broken, that the understanding and the ability is heightened and grows more sophisticated and deeper and is expressed in all the ways that are unique to each individual soul. This is the journey that we take together. We are with you, beloved souls, in your efforts to help awaken, to help guide, to help birth a new level of soul awareness and soul expression.

God is blessing us. We are joining you in your efforts to bring this awakening forward with each individual. With all the resources available, with all that may unfold in this brief time together, there may be remarkable expressions and abilities acknowledged and gifts opened with each individual. God will bless the way and you will all be inspired to be His servants, His cohorts in your efforts to awaken humanity to truth. 

May you be blessed, beloveds. Know that we are with you and we are very close, that each one of you, as you take on the responsibilities and as you’re willing to step forward as instruments, you are being blessed, deeply, inspired and opened yourselves in deeper ways. God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem. I love you. I am with you and I am close as always and I love you. God bless you. I love you.
