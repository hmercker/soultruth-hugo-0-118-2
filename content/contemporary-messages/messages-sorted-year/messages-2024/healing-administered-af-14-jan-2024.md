Beloved souls, I am Mylora. I come to bring healing to this dear instrument and to all of you, to uplift you and uphold you in light, to be God’s channel of healing and blessings for each of you. When you are engaged in God’s work, when you ask to be used as an instrument for God, when you come along in this journey to serve others, God provides what you require to be His faithful instrument, to be effective and in the light. 

God will do many things to assist you in this instrumentality. When you are speaking to others, God will put the words in your mouth. When you are ministering to those who are in need, God will guide you as to what they need, truly. When there are those in pain and physical discomfort, God will bring His healing energies and blessings through you to them. Most of all, since everyone in your world requires love, hungers for love, He will bring His Love on the wings of the Holy Spirit. He will bring His Love and soothe and comfort all.

You have been gifted this portal and blessings to bring the angels close, to bring the blessings of God amongst you, through you, into this world. When you gather together those of you in alignment with the Truth of God’s Love, those of you with a soul bright with God’s Love, and you come together in this way, a Circle of light, then you become a powerful channel of light in the world. You become God’s instruments, not only singly, but collectively, so that that power is multiplied exponentially and utilised deeply and broadly for the benefit of many.

Even your loved ones at home, even those who are a part of these circles and many, many more, are benefitting from your prayers. Do not underestimate the power of what you bring as a Circle of Light. Have faith. Even though you may not know or see or feel that much is happening, much flows, much is given, much is manifest on the spiritual level of consciousness, and the souls vibrate and hum like a purring of joy, feeling the comfort, the warmth, the blessings of God’s Touch.

So, my beautiful friends, remember that you have a role to play, each of you. That you are blessed, each of you. That you will do God’s work, bringing your component, your uniqueness, the beauty of your soul into the midst of this Circle of Light, creating such a unique and beautiful channel for God. 

May you be blessed, beloved souls, and all the beauty and wonders, all the light and love, all the peace and healing that can come from God. My love is with you. I am Mylora, and I love you dearly, beloved souls. God bless you in His Light, in His Love, in His peace and in the joy and wonderment that is a soul redeemed by the Father’s Love. God bless you. I love you. God bless you all.
