# Your Light Can Help God Break Generations of Darkness in the World

Received by Al Fike 

Thank you, my brother, for your prayer. I am with you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to be with you in prayer and to speak with you on matters of spiritual truth and importance. Each of you are endeavouring to break the shackles of error, to free yourselves from the pain and darkness that has been caused by human error. Each time you seek to receive the great gift of the Father’s Love, you break another link in those shackles. 

You make great effort to bring light to yourselves and to feel the freedom and the joy that comes with the Father’s Love entering your soul. You not only break the shackles for yourselves, but you help to break the shackles for your loved ones and your ancestors. All those in spirit who continue to reside in the lower planes of the spirit world, they too are shackled to a degree, some very much so and others continuing to strive toward truth. 

It is your efforts in prayer, the light that you bring to yourself, the blessings you carry that are a great catalyst to help free your brothers and sisters, your families, your loved ones and those who have gone before you from the conditions that humanity has created over a very long time. Now is the time for freedom to reign, for peace to be upon your Earth, for light to overshadow the darkness. Each of you who subscribes to light, truth and love is contributing to this transformation that is taking place in your world. It comes from your efforts, from the prayers of all, from the ministrations of the angels and from the Touch of God. 

Continue to pray for these things, beloveds. Continue to pray for yourself, that you may be freed completely from the shackles of darkness and error and that all around you may also find freedom. You may pray for them, beloveds, as do we. Yet our prayers can only go so far in helping to free humanity. For it is within the reach and the choice of each individual soul to choose light. They must understand that light is given to them and freely available to every soul, as is the truth. In knowing this, they may choose to be in the light. 

It is for us, all of us, to present the truth to humanity and to the dark spirits, to show them the way toward light and freedom. For we carry the key that unlocks the shackles. The key is the Love of God, that power, that glory, the transformational gift that is God’s Essence given freely. But each soul must ask. It is not given by a mere whim of God’s fiat upon humanity. It is given by God’s Grace and Love for humanity, provided they wish to receive and know the gift and the joy that comes with this gift. 

Each of you must teach this truth. Not in the way that you embellish it with many words and ideas, creating yet another dogma in the world, but to give it with all sincerity, simplicity and love. This is what will reach the souls of your brothers and sisters. This is what is powerful. The power that you carry is the gift of uttering the truth, of living the truth and demonstrating the truth. Do so in love. Ask for the grace of God to surround you and let the Truth of God be uttered through your lips. Do not hold back, but be strong, simple and truthful. Give of your heart to those who are thirsting for love, those who are lost in darkness, those who know great deprivation. Give in love and embrace your brothers and sisters. 

The world around you is in great need. Do not cloister yourself and continue to be in the grace of God and yet not exercise that grace in your actions and deeds for the benefit of your brothers and sisters. Keep yourself close to God at all times with prayer and desire, with those feelings and knowings of the soul that realises that you are truly one of God’s children and embraced by the Creator. Allow yourself to be guided by God, for God has many plans waiting for your ears to hear, eyes to see and soul to know. There is much for you to understand, beloved children of God. There is much that can be expressed and fulfilled within the Will of God if you allow it to be so. Each of you carries many gifts and has much wisdom within. Allow this wisdom to blossom forth in your consciousness and be the guiding force in your life. 

Do not allow negative forces to obstruct your efforts. When you venture forth in the world with a sense of fear and doubt, you open up the way for negative forces to continue to reinforce and sow more doubt and fear. Be clear of these things. They are only of the mind, for within your soul is great faith and true understanding. In this, allow yourself to walk in the world with your head held high, your heart open, your soul guiding you, and you will find your way along a path filled with great service and great accomplishments within the Will and harmony of God’s plan. Be free of all impediments and know that you are guided, blessed and protected. Go forth without fear and be joyous in the glory of God. Your light shall shine, my beloveds. You shall be God’s instruments and my disciples. The world is waiting, it is hungering and in great need of your ministrations. 

May you be blessed by a great inflowing of God’s Love, feeling the power of its awakening within you, transforming your being into that which is beyond the human condition into that which is divine and divinely blessed. It is happening for each one of you. Step by step, drop by drop, it is having its effects. Accept all that comes to you. Desire intensely all that God wishes to give you and you will be well on your way. You will find yourself at the entrance to the Celestial Kingdom someday. There, I will embrace you and usher you forth that you may know the endless joy, the great and infinite experience and knowings that come as you come ever closer to your Heavenly Father. 

We walk with you beloved souls. Never to forsake you, but to be with you until you are truly in the embrace of God. We love you. I love you, and that love is enduring and abiding. That love is yours. For we see and know the unique creation that you are, that God made, another jewel in the Heavens of His creation. May you be blessed, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend, Master of the Celestial Kingdom. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
