…..for that prayer that I gave many years ago, is still relevant today. I am your brother and friend, Jesus and I come to bid you goodbye, to tell you that your time together has been fruitful and beautiful. You have all bonded well together and there has been great harmony amongst you. This beautiful gift that you have given each other is important. You have created beautiful bonds that will last and you come to know and understand one another in a deeper way. Development has happened within your soul, spirit and mind, and this too is important. For the Law of Progression is an important law. It is important that each of you progress along this path as rapidly as you might. For there comes a time when you will be needed and you must be prepared. I beseech you, my beloved brothers and sisters, to continue to seek the Love of God. Continue to allow the Love of God to expand and grow within your soul and to explore what this means and what this is, how it does affect your perspective, your condition and your instrumentality.

God needs much of you, beloved souls, each and every one of you. God needs much of what you have to give in regard to your gifts and your desire to serve in love. Humanity is in a desperate situation, though they continue to ride upon the wave of distractions and pleasures. Within their souls is a deep longing. Within their souls is a deep pain because within is a hollowness, an emptiness. They do not understand who they are. They do not see a future for themselves other than that of the material world. 

They walk in ignorance and darkness, feeling numb and asleep. It is up to those brave souls who are striving for the awakening of their souls and the wakefulness of their being to come and show their brothers and sisters the way and means of fulfilment, of gathering within them such light and love that they will know the depths and breadth within them how much they are loved by God. They will know the gifts and blessings of God’s Hand upon them and they will discover the gifts and abilities that reside within their souls. Thus, a new era for humanity will be created, one that will bring a thousand years of peace, one that will bring great light, one that will bring astounding and wondrous changes to your world. You are on the forefront of this. You have been given much in order to see and recognise and come to that place of alignment with God.

We are close with you. I am close. Many angels are close and we will continue to uphold you and to guide you. We will continue to love you and embrace you. Our job is not complete. The work continues, beloved souls. Your work continues. Contemplate what that work might be and how it may expand in your life, how you may express your gifts in the world, how you may come to know God’s Will and God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. For there is much to do, beloved souls much to do and I urge you on, that the Law of Progression is fulfilled by your efforts each and every day and that you will become God’s beautiful lights in the world, channels of love, gracious and wise, beautiful in your demeanour and light, God’s children, God’s children who are and will be His instruments in the world. 

I thank you for your time spent and we are pleased at the progress, although to some of you it may feel that you have not made progress, that you wish manifestations of gifts, the outpouring and outflowing of that which lies within your soul. I say to you these things are becoming enlivened by the Touch of God. The time you have spent together has further awakened your gifts and they will in time with your dedications and your applications while you are living your life, they will manifest and in surprising ways and in surprising circumstances they will manifest and you will see your time was well spent and the efforts of the angels will have their effects and the blessings of God upon you have been great. 

My beloveds, how I love you. How close I feel to each one of you. How I honour you, for you are truly my brothers and sisters and you are my disciples. I consider you part of my family, part of my ministry, active agents of truth in the world. My deep wish is that you will see yourself in this light, that you will act in the world, express yourself and be God’s agent in this light and this knowledge. Blessed are the peacemakers. Blessed are the wayshowers. Blessed are all those who bring light to the world. God will indeed bless them and awaken them and expand them in light. You have set about and put in motion a beautiful and wondrous thing, a blessing from God, reflecting His desires and intentions in the world. You will see how these blessings will unfold and the work will progress, my beloveds, I am with you and I love you. I am your brother, your friend, Master of the Celestial Kingdom, I am Jesus and I am with you. God bless you. God bless you.
