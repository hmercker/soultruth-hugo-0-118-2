# Describes the Anticipated Impact and Participants Joining Us in Poughkeepsie

September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, John the Baptist and I come here this morning to welcome you to a new venture which will be quite different from the last few retreats, prayer sessions. You will be serving many new souls and some of whom are coming with the human participants, some of whom you know and some of whom you have never seen before. Your will in alignment with God’s to serve God to bring truth and love to these souls will have a major impact upon their souls. Some of these souls will become leaders in this so-called movement of Divine Love.

You may not see it immediately but there will be changes in these people that will impact their everyday lives and they will, I assure, turn to God and open to receive God’s blessings in a very deep and profound way. This in terms off progress of these retreats will be, to put it in Earth terms, the most successful of these current meetings and prayer sessions. So go forward. Stretch. Extend yourselves, each one, for the highest outcome. Keep God’s purpose and will in the forefront that you will have the most success. God bless you. We will be with you and yes, there will be a surprise or two. God bless you. I am John, your brother, once known as the Baptist. May God bless you.
