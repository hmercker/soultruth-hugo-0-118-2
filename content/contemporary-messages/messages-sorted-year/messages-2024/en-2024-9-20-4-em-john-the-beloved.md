John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John, the Beloved and we surround you and protect you throughout this retreat. We welcome you to this Circle of Love and Light and encourage you to open to the love that is available to each one of you. You are not far from the truth. You have stepped into the room where there is love manifested from the Father in very great abundance and you shall take with you one of us to help you understand what it is that is being offered to you during these prayers. We will be with you. You can ask us your questions before you go to sleep and know the answers in the morning. This will help you to see that we are here to serve you, to bring you closer to the Source of all love and light. You may trust us. We do our Father’s Will, which is perfect.

We love, we love each soul in this room and desire only that you develop this love that brings such beauty, such comfort, such joy and happiness. That is our desire and it is our Father’s Will. May god bless each one of you. We will be close with you, very close. Please ask us for your help. Ask us to help you in anything that you require. May god bless you. My love is with you. I am John the Beloved.
