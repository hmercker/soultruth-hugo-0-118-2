# Talk to God 

December 16<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

It is I, your brother and friend, Yogananda. I promised my brother I would come tonight because I wished to share some truth with this beautiful group. 

When I was beginning my spiritual journey, I often found myself in the company of those considered saints or great sages, and what impressed me the most was their conversations with God. They would speak to the heavenly Father and I realized they did not assume a distance but rather an intimacy. 

Not only did they talk, but they listened, and this would inform their teachings. So, do not assume please, that you are unworthy of speaking to your Creator. For have not all cried out, dear God, please help me, dear God, please send a healing, dear God, forgive me, release me from my error. And did not all receive an answer and a blessing?

In every spiritual tradition, there are angelic helpers. In Hinduism we often call these divas or devas, and the same is true in Buddhism. In the Jewish tradition, there are different levels of angels, and the Christian religion adopted these. The Muslims had helpers they sometimes called jinns, and the word "genie" is derived from jinns, who can be mischievous but also quite helpful, and they have the word “angels”, too. 

When you need assistance on the material plane these spirits, these angels, these spiritual beings, come to your aid. For instance if you misplace your keys, you may ask God directly, but one of these helpful spirits will come to your aid because God answers all sincere prayers with love. God is the source of love. The Creator of the universe always responds to sincere prayers from the heart, from the soul, with love. The celestial angels, and I am one, assist those on the path of Divine Love. We do this with joy and are always delighted to receive another soul into the family of Divine Love. We come, as you know, to give our simple guidance. We come to remind, to stir and to heal in the love of God.

I was mindful of Master Jesus talking to God and receiving guidance and sharing his prayers with his followers, instructing them to pray. He encouraged them to be at one with the heavenly Father as he is one, as all are one, in God’s love. If you learn nothing else in this world, it is my wish, and all of us here, that you will take the time to open your heart and your soul in asking to receive the great gift of God’s love. For all else will be given. Reach for the highest, my friends, and you will not be disappointed. Allow God to touch you. Give God your troubles, your grief, your illness, your error and you will be free, you will be blessed. 

I thank you for allowing me to come today and for my brother for taking this message which I longed to give. I shall step back and join you in the silence of all of our soul longings going to the Father for His love. May God bless us. I am Yogananda.
