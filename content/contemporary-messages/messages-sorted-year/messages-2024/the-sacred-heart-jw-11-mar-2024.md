# The Sacred Heart 

March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your brother in the love of God. I am Jesus. 
  
You can trust your heart to know what is love. My heart is transformed and yet still beats for the world. Longinus, who pierced my heart on the day of my crucifixion and saw water and blood, later became a follower and is now a Celestial angel. 

He felt the Love of God despite his job to make sure I had passed, and it sent him into deep prayer, partially from remorse but more importantly to feel the Love of God. His act has become interpreted as the water meaning baptism and the blood meaning redemption. But I shall say again, this is not true. For really the message of my death was that there is no death of the soul and yes, I came back in a body of, as you say ectoplasm, provided by God and the angels, and my soul was recognizable even though my personal appearance was not, except by a few. 

I am called *“The Sacred Heart”,* and the true meaning of the sacred heart is a heart given to God, a heart transformed in Divine Love, a heart in peace. I told my disciples, I shall leave you in peace, a peace that the world cannot give and this peace I spoke of, is the great peace that a heart transformed lives in, whether that heart be in a mortal frame or a spirit body. This peace is often referred to as the peace that passes human understanding. It is the peace of the love of God, divine empathy, divine comfort, divine embrace. For when the heart is opened, however broken, broken open to the love of God, it is changed. 
    
Let the love of God change you. All else will be given. All these things that you may require, that you may feel you cannot live without, all these things will be given to you. For God provides for the spiritual needs of all His children, and His angels assist in providing comfort in the material needs and the guidance that each one requests in prayer. So follow your hearts. Open to this great love of God. You are my brothers and sisters, and we are one in the Father’s love for all time and beyond. With all my love and blessings, I shall join you now in this prayer and I embrace each one in the love of God. May all be blessed. I am Jesus.
