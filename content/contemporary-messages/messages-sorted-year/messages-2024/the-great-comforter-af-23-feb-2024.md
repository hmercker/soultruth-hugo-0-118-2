I love you, beloved children. I am Mary and I love you. Indeed, the great Comforter of God's Love is upon us all, seeking to heal, to bring peace, to awaken the feelings of love and acknowledgement of the soul. That God's great Soul may indeed send the Comforter through the Holy Spirit upon each one of you so that you may feel the warmth, the peace and the love. For is this not what your soul seeks, beloveds? The beautiful Touch of God upon you, to know that you are loved, to know that you are in the light. That all conditions that are not of love and light are banished from this room. As we pray in this Circle of Light so we banish the darkness and bring the Holy Spirit into our midst. 

God wishes for each one of us to know His blessings, to be uplifted by them. Whether you are in grief or joy, it matters not. Each feeling, each expression of the soul will draw the Father's Touch upon you. In this you are awakened more fully. You feel, know and sense the greater aspects of your soul seeking to come alive, seeking to be loved, seeking to be all that it can be. Your yearnings and longings that come in prayer will open the doorway to the Touch of the Father upon you. Indeed, we come as the intensity and power of your prayers are sent forth. We respond accordingly. The strength and collective efforts that you make bring many angels into your midst. In this we may work through you to bring blessings to others. So to answer prayers as we are God's emissaries and instruments, as are you, beloveds. 

The chain of light continues to be strengthened and expressed in the world. Each of you are important intermediaries for God's work and His blessings for many. Do not think that your prayers alone, your efforts alone, merely bring blessings to you alone. No, my beloveds. The extent and breadth of Light and blessings from God may be expressed fully and powerfully through each one of you. Open yourselves to the Will of God. Open yourselves to God's Touch that will flow through you. 

Do you not feel it, beloveds? Do you not feel the grace of God working, touching you, bringing comfort, but also flowing around and through you, bringing blessings to others? This is why we ask you to pray for many, to pray for this world, where you help open the portals and blessings to this world. Know you are loved, my beloveds. Know you are loved. God's children all are blessed, embraced, upheld and protected. Each of you a precious and loved child of God. Feel the embrace, and open yourselves fully to it. You will know the upliftment and joy that comes with the Father's blessings upon you. 

I am Mary, and I love you. I love you so. I too come close and embrace you in love, as do many angels. Awaken to this light. Awaken to these blessings. This will be the key to a wondrous life filled with joy, anticipation, peace, love, truth, insight, healing. Many, many blessings come to you with the opening of your hearts to the blessings from God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you dearly. Mary loves you. Mary loves you. God bless you.
