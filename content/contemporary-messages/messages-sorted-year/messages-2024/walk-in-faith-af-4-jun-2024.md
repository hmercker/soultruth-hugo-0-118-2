May peace be with you, beloved souls. I am Faith. I too, come to pray with you, my friends on Earth. My two beautiful friends who are intrepid travellers, planning and executing their guidance as they walk in faith and make effort to connect and pray with others. If Jesus were alive today, don’t you think that he would do the same? To try and travel as much ground as possible, speaking to and connecting with as many as possible. 

For in order to broadcast the seeds of truth in the world, you need to be in the world and walk in the world as God’s channels of love. to be upright and strong, to be clear and loving, to be a light, this is what is needed. These two beautiful souls are examples of this, but they are merely two of many who are being developed, upheld and shown the way. That they too, may do the work of our beloved brother, Jesus. That they too, may spread the truth of God’s Love in the world.

It is important for you to look forward, my friends, to see how you may be a channel of truth in the world. Though your minds may discredit what your souls know, each day comes as a challenge and an invitation to walk in the world as a channel of light, to bring the Truth of God’s Love to whoever will listen. What it takes from you is willingness, maybe a touch of bravery and a great deal of faith. For when you listen to the Will of God, and with faith you enact the Will of God, then indeed, the possibilities that may come into your life so that you may be God’s instruments, channels of love, will be wide in scope, and often surprising in outcomes. You, too, may find yourself travelling to distant places, speaking and embracing those who you do not know, strangers, but yet kindred souls. 

You will each find your way in this effort to be God’s instruments and channels of love, to trod upon the Earth and bring light, peace and blessings, to speak of how much God loves each and every soul, to be God’s instruments in a variety of ways using your gifts and creativity to reach out with your unique capacities and abilities. So much you can do, beloved souls. So much can be done, but it starts with a desire to serve. It starts when you step forward, however tentative that may be. Indeed, you take that first steps. Followed by that first step will come another and another and another until you wonder why you were afraid to speak and to be God’s instrument in such a way that others will take notice and that others will benefit. 

You see it is not you that is doing this. It is not you that is required to be eloquent and confident and all of those things that make up a good orator and speaker. It is you who is willing, a soul that allows God to work through and to bring blessings forward. That is all that is required. For God can make you the greatest orator on Earth if he so chooses. For if you have great faith and are willing, He will put the words in your mouth, the words that will touch other souls, the words that speak the truth. If you are willing, He will make you a great light, a channel for love and healing, upliftment and peace. This is God’s work and these are God’s blessings. It is for you to say, *“Use me, dear and beloved Creator, use me as your instrument. I am willing. Help me to quell my fears and doubts and help me to extend my love and my desire to serve my brothers and sisters.”* In this prayer, God will answer you and you will be surprised with how God answers, what God puts upon your path, what God brings to you as an opportunity to serve. It will be surprising and varied and full of beautiful blessings. 

So, my beloved friends, seek to serve. Seek to be God’s instruments and this will open up a whole new world for each and every one of you and the many more who may listen to this message, and the many more who aspire to be God’s servants. It is only the limitations of the mind that restrict the possibilities of the soul. Allow your soul to be free and unrestricted and you will find your way as His instruments. As dear and beloved Jesus said: *“These things I do, you may do also and in greater measure.”* Do you believe this? Do you understand what he is saying? God needs each and every one of you to be His instruments. There are few who are willing, but the work is so great and in need of more who are willing. Be willing, my beloved and beautiful friends, and walk in the grace of God and you will find your way serving humanity in abilities and gifts that you have no idea at this moment that may manifest through you. Each is gifted and each shall find their gifts and express them in love. 

God bless you, my friends. I am Faith. My love is with you. Beautiful souls, beautiful souls, my love is with you.
