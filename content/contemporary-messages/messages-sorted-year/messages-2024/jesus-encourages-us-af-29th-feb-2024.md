Kona Retreat, HI, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike 



I come to bless you, beloveds. I am Jesus. I come to help you on your journey. Each of you has a destiny and a purpose in this world that is yet to be fulfilled, but shall be fulfilled in time. I have come to encourage and to strengthen you in the love, to tell you and reassure you that God's plan for each one of you is perfect and shall suit your needs and your gifts. All that your soul is meant to be and do in the world shall be fulfilled by God's Touch upon you, God's guidance for your journeys of service to others. 

You come together to be blessed, to part of God's great plan, to love one another and to love humanity. As such, you become my disciples and you come into the great flow of the Will of God to bring greater light to this world, to bring the healing that shall dissipate the darkness. Each of you have tremendous gifts and capacities to be that instrument. I say this to each one of you, do not discount yourself, beloveds. Yet, realise that there is much to do and a journey to take in preparation so that you are able to fulfill God's intention and plan that will live through each one of you in this world. 

Changes will take place in your life that will open the doors to the expression of this service in times to come and in conditions that will be challenging. Yet you, my beloveds, will feel the joy of God rather than the challenge of the material world, will live within that joy, will have the wisdom, strength and capacity to serve God in the ways in which He has destined you to do so. 

May your gifts continue to flourish in His Love. May you find your way on a straight and narrow path toward truth, toward reclamation of your soul and its transformation in love. God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and your friend. I am with you always. I love you. I am Jesus and I love you, beloveds. God bless you.
