I am happy to be with you today, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. You have seen how the flow of God’s Will works and has its impact in your travels and with the people that you meet. Your past few days have been a good example of how God works and how the flow of God’s Will, peace and love continues to make harmony and peace amongst you. This will continue, beloved souls. You will continue to see how every moment has its potentials, its possibilities for the flow of God’s Will and intention to manifest and materialise in your life. 

Have faith in the moment, beloved souls. Have faith in God’s Will and how the moment of time and the Will of God come together in something that is impactful and powerful in its blessing. Do not restrict the manifestation of God’s Will for any moment. Allow it to manifest in all its beauty, love, strength and light. With each individual that you meet, with each moment that you travel, pray to be used as an instrument for God’s Will. Pray to be a light in the world. God will utilise every moment, every moment as an opportunity for blessings to flow, for individuals to benefit and for you, beloved souls, to be uplifted. 

May the blessings of God be with you, the strength of His Love carry you, the wisdom of your souls guide you and the light that is God’s Touch be around you. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I love you. Precious children of God, I love you.
