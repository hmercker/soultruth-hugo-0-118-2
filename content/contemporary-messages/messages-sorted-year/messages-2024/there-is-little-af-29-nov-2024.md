# There is Little That Can Keep You From God

November 29<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike 

There is much that holds you back from God, my beloved and beautiful students. I am your teacher, Augustine. But, compared to most in your world, there is little that holds you back from God. You have initiated the journey toward at-onement with God. You have understood the way in which that initiation might take place. You are on the Path Divine, seeking the Love of God. 

So, those things that are impediments to you are not of the soul, but they are of the mind. They are old and obsolete conditions and patterns of mind that continue to hold you from conscious recognition of your soul's relationship with God. God does not inhibit any blessing to you. All is given freely. Yet you, beloved souls, have trouble feeling, knowing and acknowledging this blessing. Rather, many of  you continue to entertain the obstructions of your mind and to feel unworthy. 

Yet, these things are irrelevant. It is time to go beyond these entertaining ideas and obstructions and to be free, free of the conditions that continue to hold you from God. If you are able to do this, great joy awaits you. Beautiful blessings are bestowed upon you, wondrous gifts awakening within you. These are part of that hidden part of you that you do not often acknowledge or understand.

It is now time to put aside your doubts and your fears and to be with your soul and with your soul, be with God. So simple and yet so difficult for you. We are there to assist you. God is there to uphold you and uplift you. All elements of the universe conspire to bring you close, to help you understand your true self and the true nature of the universe.

It is for you to shuck off those parts of you, those elements within you that cover you, that cover your feelings and perceptions of what is truly your beautiful being, your beautiful soul. May you be released from these conditions. You may be released at this very moment if you but open yourself fully and with faith to what God has to give to you. That release may be powerful and wondrous. It is for you to determine, my beloved and beautiful students, what it is that you will receive and what it is that will be given.

God bless you, beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. Open wide to the gifts of God's Love and be redeemed in this. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.
