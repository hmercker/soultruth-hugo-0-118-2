# The New Birth 

June 24<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

It is I, Care. My dear ones, I come in the love of God within this prayer, each soul allowing the most holy spirit of the Creator to bring the Divine Love; this love that creates a new soul. When the Master spoke of being born again, he was misinterpreted to mean through vicarious atonement through various beliefs, none of which were or are, transformational. And as Paul<sup>1</sup> spoke through brother Al about the human love, about its beauty and purification, he also differentiated between those who do take the path less traveled, wishing to be transformed, born again in the love of God in at-One-ment with the very essence of our Creator.
    
It does not matter where you are on this journey. It only matters that you are on this journey. This journey of the soul into eternity and endless progression becomes so filled with God’s love and light that a new being is created, and yet each one here, a unique soul, will retain their uniqueness. When you give up the trappings and the attachments of the material world, you gain so much more in spirit. And though you may personally go through many a dark night, feeling disconnected, feeling lost and without the joy of this connection in grace, it is then when your soul sends up that longing: *“Dear God, heal me, bring me your love, change me, lift me up,”* that God sends His angels, often through a friend or even a stranger, saying: *“My friend, don’t despair. It will all be good. Everything will work out.”* As you expiate these things that have clung to your soul and the magnetism of God’s love removes them, you are once again lifted every step of the way, up the celestial ladder. So, do not worry where you are on your journey. Do not fear criticism or require praise, for God sees all that you do, forgives all your errors, and rewards every time you give love to another. 
     
This prayer is simple. It does not require great intellectual capacity. It only requires the longings of your soul to be in ascendancy over all your concerns, if even for a few moments, to rest, that God may touch you. Let this love come into your souls, heal you, and bring you joy in this transformation from the mortal to the immortal, from the human to the divine angel. 
    
Oh, my dear ones, you are so very loved. You are so very loved. Go in peace. I thank you. I am your sister in Christ and your eternal friend. I am Care.
