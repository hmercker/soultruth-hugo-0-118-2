Oh, precious, precious souls, I am Confucius. Indeed, we guard you, beloved souls. How few on this Earth seek the truth as you do, are dedicated as you are. We guard you because you are indeed precious. Indeed, God’s Love for you flows readily, beautifully, upon you and within you. 

Hearken to your angel friends. Seek your Creator in all things. What you require for guidance and for the nourishment of your soul so that you may be propelled forward in light, and will come to you by your efforts. You determine the pace, beloved souls. You determine the power of the blessing. 

It is your will and desire that brings what is given. It is a law. The law must be obeyed in accordance to what God has set forth for His children. We encourage you, but we can not make you do anything. We can not force you upon a certain way or path. You must determine this for yourself, that you make that understanding and decision, that you may move forward in accordance to your will. 

All is given freely, but to receive is often difficult for you because you do not feel worthy or you are too engaged in the material to even recognise and acknowledge the blessings from God. Yet, they are all around you, beloved souls, all around you. It is for you to take the moment to receive and to ask to be in alignment with God. 

Is this difficult? No, no, it is not difficult. For you, it is to overcome the thoughtful conditions of the material world and to be in the Grace of God. To walk in this light that God provides. God’s great Soul beams His Light upon each one of you, and seeks for your acknowledgement and acceptance. To bring into yourself that which is a blessing and an acknowledgement of how much God loves you, and seeks to uplift you, seeks to heal you, and to make right all things in your life. 
You must act in accordance with the laws, and you must be in harmony with His Will. Otherwise, what is given falls away rather than is absorbed. Think of this, my friends. Beautiful birds of truth and light. Think of how you may sing your songs to your Creator. Flutter forth into the light, absorbing and communing with the great blessings of God. 

God bless you. I am Confucius, and I walk with you as well upon your journeys toward light, truth, service and love. All the goodness, all the goodness, of a soul yearning to be at-one with God. 

God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. I come to uplift and to be with you in prayer. God bless you. Confucius loves you dearly, precious friends. God bless
