Yogananda received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my friends. I am Yogananda. This dear instrument has been reading some of my messages that have been delivered in the last few years. I have been close to him as a result and I carried on in my closeness observing him during his day, which was a very busy day indeed.

I want to talk about the opportunities that are available to you on the Earth plane for spiritual experience, enlightenment and growth. It is different from the spirit world, where souls gather. They cluster into various conditions, attitudes and energies that seem to keep them cloistered in this condition, especially in the lower planes of spirit. In this world of yours, you have all manner of conditions, from very high to very low.

If you know how to operate and utilise the Laws of Attraction, you can bring very high blessings and spirits close to you through prayer, desire and thought. You will have the opportunity to have friends who are beautiful souls, who are there to uplift you and uphold you in truth, who are there to pray with you, who are there to reinforce truth in many ways in your life. For even though they have a spirit body, and those who are Celestial are Angels, they have a power about them, a beautiful ability and many gifts that can bring spiritual blessings close.

It is important for you to recognise, acknowledge and utilise this knowledge for your benefit. Of course, nothing replaces prayer. Prayer is the foundation for any spiritual endeavour. With prayer, you can also ask that your guides and gatekeepers may come to help you and to bless you, for they are very gifted indeed and they are very bright in light.

It is for you, my beautiful friends, to open to this, to open to God and to open to the blessings of your spirit friends. Just as you embrace a friend on this world of yours, you might embrace a friend in the spirit world. You might be open to their love and influence to help you and to uphold you. There is much that you may benefit from this. You may feel their beautiful, loving energies toward you and be a light as they are, to help you to be protected and to influence you in the way of your mind, your material mind, your spirit mind and your soul mind. All these things, all these minds, may come into alignment with the help of your friends. Your desires, emotional state and spiritual perceptions and understandings may come into greater focus, into sharper alignment when your friends are close.

 I want you to know that we are on the ready to help you, to assist you, to bring truth to your consciousness, to be there in prayer, so that we may add our prayers to yours, to protect you as you navigate the world, to influence others around you that they may come close. In many ways, God and His angels may utilise you as a channel, a beautiful channel of light and blessings for another.

There are many, many reasons why it is important for you to be aware and to cultivate this friendship with your angel friends, the bright spirits and even the bright, stellar friends that endeavour to be close. Each carries their purpose and gift to help uphold you. Each is there for a reason and a purpose. Though we do not wish for you to obsess about this and make this your primary goal, these awarenesses of your friends, but they are an adjunct to your prayers and spiritual endeavours to be close to God. So, it is important that the balance be struck and the awarenesses come and flow readily and harmoniously into your lives.

In this way, you will never be lonely. In this way, whenever you are in need, you have friends there to help you, to assist you in any way, even material ways. But, it is the important factor of setting forth your intentions, your prayers and your desires so that it opens the door to the blessings that might come. Are you asking, my beloved friends? If you are, what do you ask for? Are you asking for things that are in harmony with God's Laws of Love, in harmony with God's Laws of Creation, in harmony with your journey, the trajectory of your soul in its desire to seek at-onement with God?

When these things are in alignment, then you may ask anything. Indeed, in one way or another, your prayers will be answered. Conditions will change around you, whether they be material or spiritual. There will be greater harmony, and your needs will be met. Test this theory out, my beloved friends. Make it a truth in your life. If you do so with faith and trust, then you will find that God will answer every prayer. He may not answer those prayers exactly the way you anticipate or would like, but they will be answered, and greater harmony will come to you.

This is a law and, indeed, our desire is that there will be great harmony in your lives and that you will know the joy of being alive. You will know the fulfilment of your soul, growing, changing and expanding in Love, the Love of God. You will have the wisdom of the soul come readily to your consciousness. You will be at peace and your life will demonstrate a beautiful harmony, a beautiful light.

It is all there for the asking, my friends. Are you asking? God wants you to ask. Do not be afraid. Do not judge your asking, your desires and your needs. Rather, put them forth and leave them at the Feet of God and do not have a second thought about it. Wait and you will see that God will answer and God will give you what you need and require, to be in the light, to be harmonious and to know that you can rely on God, His angel friends, the bright spirits and many more to attend to you on this earthly plane and to bring you light, beautiful light, glorious light, uplift you and bring joy.

It comes to each one of you, my friends. You are worthy, you are beautiful and you, most of all, are loved. God bless you, my friends and keep you in His Love, keep you in the light, keep you in harmony, peace and joy. God bless you. I am Yogananda and I love you truly. I love you all, fledgling souls eager to grow. May you be blessed and grow a little more upon the Path of Love. God bless you.
