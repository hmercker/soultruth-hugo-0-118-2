I am here, your brother, Judas. My dear friends, thank you for coming together to pray for the love of God and on this occasion to celebrate the birth of my brother.  I wish to tell him there are many of his friends and family in spirit with us as well as his beloved. 
   
What does it mean to be born? It means you are an individualized consciousness, a soul residing in a spirit body in a mortal frame for a time with the great possibility of your soul progressing in love, human and divine. The human experience is filled with trials and tribulations, as well as triumphs and as you celebrate your overcoming difficulties, you also honor those who have been transformed in love.   
     
The human birth is a necessary experience for every soul, however long, however short, and its’ passing into spirit at the death of the physical body is the birth of the soul into spirit. Something, that for most souls, except the very nefarious, can celebrate, being born into a world of light, of harmony. The words attributed to the Master, *“I am the resurrection and the life”,* can of course be interpreted in several ways. For the most part, Christians interpret this as victory of life over death and this is certainly true, as demonstrated by the Master on Easter. 

However, there is a deeper meaning, which my brother Paul tried to explain to James Padgett, and I shall bring that to the fore this evening. For the real resurrection of the soul is to be reborn in the love of God and the life that the Master spoke of is eternal life, true immortality. The soul becoming transformed into the very substance of the Creator, in love, never again facing an ending, but eternal progression, expansion, and the great, great happiness that comes with a soul transformed. 

So let me say that there are three births, the human birth, the human passing of the soul and birth into spirit, and the rebirth of the soul transformed in the love of God. If you can perceive the deeper meaning of this message, you can rest in the assurance that this magnificent journey will lead you all to immortality and eternal love. 
   
Your family is ever expanding with so many who love you in spirit as well as on earth in the love of God endlessly embracing each soul that opens to it. So, leave your troubles, leave your regrets, leave your doubts, and leave your transgressions behind. Walk in forgiveness. Walk as a soul grateful to be alive and knowing this will continue, for this path, as my brother would call it, ‘The path of the roses’, is ever blooming and its fragrance permeates the entire being as well as the entire cosmos and all the universes of the Creator. 
   
We welcome you. We are with you. On behalf of all here, we not only congratulate my brother, taking this message, but every soul, a unique creation of God and your births. We shall be together on this journey for all time and beyond. How you are loved and how I love you. 
    
Go in peace. I am your brother and friend, in Christ. I am Judas. God bless you.
