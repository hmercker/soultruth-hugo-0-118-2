John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Beloved and I beseech each one of you to delve deeply, deeply into your being. You, each one of you, has experienced that part of you, previously, if only for a moment. Now I ask you, go deep within. Seek the Father’s love and go deep within. You are anointed with this gift of Divine Love. You must come to know it and understand and see and truly know that it is part of you. It is of you. It is becoming your substance. Consider this truth that your soul is becoming the substance of our Heavenly Father.

Go deeply. Allow those longings to rise to the Father. Have your blessed communion as those longings are responded to. This is the path, my beloved brothers and sisters. This is the truth. This is the way as our Master has shown. You all are capable so go deep and pray for God’s love to fill you even more to transform your soul into His substance and experience the joy and the love and the truth of Divinity given to you by our Creator.

God bless you. May God’s love be upon you and may you be open to receive it. My love is with you. God bless you all.
