# Marmora Friends are Seeking

September 26<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Syracuse, NY, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Beloved and I will usher you into the next phase of this tour, bringing many angels and spirits with you to help firm up the environment in which you will be. These are spirits who have come a long way across the galaxy. You will be protected. You will be uplifted. You will gain greater insight into the minds, the beliefs, the attitudes of those who are not yet on the path but who are searching for the truth. You may feel frustrated for a moment, but remember they are souls and they are seeking. What you have to offer them is what they are seeking for, although they are not aware of it and may even resist it. But come to this place with your hearts and souls wide open, expressing the love that is within you at every moment and their souls will be satisfied in learning that there is something different from what they have that they are seeking for.

This is part of your mission. This is part of your purpose for going to this place where the mind rules the spiritual nature of these souls. Once again, I say to you, they are seeking souls. Love them. Pray for them to be willing to receive your expressions of love and that they be open to receive the tenderness that your love provides for them. For many have not felt or understood God’s Love as being gentle, tender, caring. I know you will do well because you are capable. You have what it takes within you to bring them closer to their goal of what they are searching for. Listen closely to your guidance. Stay open and express your love, that you may bring forward new souls onto this path one step at a time.

My love is with you. Many of us will be with you. May God bless you. I am John the Beloved and I do love you, truly.
