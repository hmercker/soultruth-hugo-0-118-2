# How Exquisite Your Souls Are

January 16<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Barbados

Martha received by Elizabeth Mack

You are such exquisite souls. If you could see the light, you would not question anything. Such beautiful, loving, bright souls. You are truly God’s children. What more do you need to know? What more can you ask for? To be His true children, in light and love with the power of that love to carry you forward, with the joy in your souls ready to burst forward. So blessed. So beautiful. I wish you could see what I see. I wish you could see how beautiful and precious are your souls. God is so great and the love that you have is mightier than you think. Take up your staffs, children. There is work to be done. And we all will be with you every step of the way. Gather your flocks. Bring them home. Embrace them. The Father has blessed you with this mission. Do not tarry any longer. Your will is God’s will. God bless you in your work as you move forward. You with the mighty love in your souls, each of you. Each of you so beautiful. God bless you. God bless us all.
