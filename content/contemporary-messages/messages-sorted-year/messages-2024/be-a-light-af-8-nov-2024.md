# Be a Light and Do Not Get Caught Up in the Darkness and Turmoil in the World

The world is in need of you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. The world continues to languish in error and in pitiable darkness where the conditions of humanity thrive in situations and in relationships that lack love, relationships and conditions that are more concerned about material gain, power and control than it is in love, openness and generosity. Yes, people try their best to bring about a harmonious life, but indeed, the general miasma of darkness around the Earth continues to influence and degrade that intention to the point where there is suffering for many.

It is important that you pray for light, for your world. That you continue to absorb the light of the Father’s Love into your souls. That you may be a light. Each of you is needed. Each of you is an important generator of light and can be a powerful channel of love in the world. It is for you to reject the human condition and all that this entails and for you to adopt the truth and all that is truth, so that you may walk in the world without the inhibitions and shackles, as our beloved son suggests, that keep you from the light and from the truth. That you may know a joy welling up within your souls that will inform every moment of your life, everything that you experience, everything you perceive. That you are truly God’s child in the truth of God’s Love, an expression of Love touching every part of your life, every aspect of your being, a reflection of this great gift that God gives to each of you.

Do not forsake your journey and compromise yourself within the journey of human endeavour that insists that you forsake God and adopt the will and expression of man. It is a choice to do so and it truly is a challenge to do so. For it is easier to be with the flow of human thought and condition than to break from this and be within the truth, harmony and grace that is God’s Will and God’s creation. Your soul knows how to be and do in this way. So, I ask you to listen to that deep part of you, to come to understand what this entails and to work, thrive and put great effort into being in the truth, grace and harmony that is God’s Love expressed through you and within you.

Yes, there is so much that needs addressing on your world and within it. I ask you not to be caught up entirely in seeing the flaws and the conditions that are so obvious and so dark that it is upsetting and of great concern. When you see these things and feel this way, turn your attention to God and ask for God to bless and bring harmony to all that is of darkness, rather than you feeling, knowing and taking on the burden of this darkness. Ask God, your Creator, to bless all that is in our world and bring darkness to light. Ask God to bless you, that you may not have deep judgements, pain and concerns that are not imbued with light and love, for it is light and love that will be the antidote to these things.

When you are guided to be an instrument of change, to bring some small effort forward to help change the conditions into greater light, then I bid you to listen to God’s guidance and to walk upon the path of love with deep dedication, faith and strength. Yes, there is much that needs healing and upliftment in your world. I urge you to go to God in prayer to seek the ways and means that He may use you for the healing and the efforts to bring harmony and light. This is an act of faith, an act of understanding truth, an act of humility and an act of grace.

When your mind is fully engaged in judgement, then you obstruct the flow of Love, grace and light through you. Allow the flow to be uninhibited and be in that harmony that is the truth, that is the light. May you be blessed, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I urge you forward in light. I urge you to be a light and to bring light in everything you are and everything that you do.

God bless you, beloved souls. Your teacher, Augustine, loves you and is with you every day of your lives. I have a part to play, a prayer to give and some effort to make. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
