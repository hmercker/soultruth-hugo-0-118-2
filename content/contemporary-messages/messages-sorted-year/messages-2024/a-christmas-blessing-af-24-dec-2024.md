Mary received by Al Fike 

I am Mary. The gift of a son to a mother is a beautiful gift from God. The gift of my beloved son was a gift to the world. I had the blessing and the privilege of raising the one who brought the great gift of Love and the Truth of Love to the world.

This has brought me great joy, joy that has expanded and deepened beyond your imagination, joy that is a reflection of God's Love growing within me, joy in the love that I have, not only for my beloved son and not only for my children all, but for all the children of the world. All of you, I love. All of God's children, I love. All who struggle and toil upon your Earth, I love. For it is within my heart, great love that is expressed to all and is expressed toward all life. For when oneâ€™s soul is awakened, transformed and grows in this great Essence of God, there can only be love and there is only love.

For all who struggle and are lost in darkness, what do they need but your love and God's Love? The angels set forth upon your world to bring peace and love to many. We are together in our efforts, our desires, to be God's instruments of peace in the world. May you find peace in your heart, my beloveds. May you find the capacity to love wherever you go and whoever you meet. Know the grace of God expressed through you may bring that peace forth and touch another soul. Be that lantern, that light in the world.

I join you in prayer, in this light that you have brought to yourselves through the longings of your heart and soul for the world. We pray together for this world to know peace, that all that is lacking within the hearts of men may be satisfied by the Touch of God upon them. That all the suffering of children and all of humanity may be wiped clean from your world and be replaced with abundance and joy, acknowledging every soul for their worth and their beauty. That all the darkness of men may dissolve into the light of truth, love and joy. 

This is our mission, our ministry, beloveds together, to wipe clean the slate, to bring peace to the world, to show humanity the way toward what is truly peace that comes through the bestowal of the Father's Love upon the soul. Be that light, beloveds, as my dear son desires of each one of you, as God, the Creator, desires of each one of you to be that light in the world and to bring peace wherever you go.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am Mary and I love you. My dear, dear children, I love you. Go in peace. Go in peace.
