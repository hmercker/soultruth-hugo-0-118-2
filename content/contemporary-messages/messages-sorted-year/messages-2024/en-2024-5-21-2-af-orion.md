My friends, it is Orion here. Once again, we meet, we pray, we discuss various topics and issues pertaining to your soul. Indeed, for some of you it may seem like a very long journey you have taken, one that started years ago in your earthly time. It seems like it has been an arduous journey. Indeed, in the timing of the universe, it is a blink of an eye. In that period of time, you have progressed, each of you. Each of you have found your way along a path that has been somewhat circuitous, but has been directed, effective and efficient in its direction.

You are discovering your soul, the workings of your soul, the signals and expressions of your soul that come to your consciousness. You are learning how to attune yourself to these things. As you grow in the great gift of Love from the Creator, so the faculties and capacities of the soul are becoming more evident and more powerful within you. Yes, the journey requires time, it requires effort. It requires testing and retesting of the waters so that you may learn and come to grow in your consciousness all things of the soul.

As you learn and grow, you are being used as God’s channels, instruments to help others learn and grow. It will be one to another, soul to soul. It can only be this way. For how else is the truth learned and experienced, but one soul going to God or a variety of souls such as this sharing amongst themselves the experience of the Divine? As you do so, you will open up possibilities and directions that God intends, part of this great plan so that humanity may shift in consciousness and shift in its priorities and its endeavours so that it is more in alignment with all that is of God and God’s creation.

Harmony, harmony is what is needed. Harmony comes with love. Harmony is an expression of love, done through each individual’s actions and thoughts. Harmony must ensue as you grow in love. Harmony must be the expression of love. When you are in disharmony, when the world around you is fragmented, shattered by the human condition, you have one of two choices, to be in harmony with God, thereby bringing that influence into the condition, or to join the disharmony leading yourself away from God. Indeed, it is important that you learn the discernment between the two. For your reflexive thoughts and actions in this world of yours are more in alignment with disharmony than harmony, at least often they are.

It is when you make that concerted choice, beloved souls, to express love and express harmony in the world, that things become smooth, harmonious, gentle and loving. When your mind interjects judgments, fear, erroneous thought and belief, then you contribute to the dark, the darkness of this world. But when you are elevated in thought and perception with love, kindness, generosity, humbleness, joy and love, then you are interjecting light into darkness. You are becoming that instrument, that intermediary for God, to bring greater light into the world.

You are mature enough and you have walked this road long enough that it is time to take responsibility for every thought, every action, every reaction and be that harmonious individual that you desire to be and are intended to be, so that you may walk the road of light, the road of harmony, the road of truth. They should not be just the intentions that you put forth in your prayers, often thoughtful and in alignment with what you believe you should be. Rather, to be that individual truly, to be in alignment with that harmony truly, to be a loving channel truly. Are you that far away from this, my beloved friends? No, you are not, although the world tests you, of course. There are situations and scenarios that bring out this darker side of yourself. But indeed, with each test there is the opportunity to change your thinking and doing, to be that channel of light, peace and harmony.

It is not so difficult for you, for you understand the basics of it, the foundation of it. You are building that foundation daily in your prayers. It is a matter of application, of being truly that individual. Thus, I encourage you. Not so much as a mental act, an act of discipline and that trial and error effort that comes with this, but as an act of your soul expressed, for within your soul is not disharmony, but harmony. Within your soul is not unloving thoughts and conditions, but love and light. The more you are in alignment with your soul, the less likely these mindful conditions erupt and express themselves and bring disharmony.

This is a new way of being, I know, a way that is not common. It is not well understood by any of you on Earth, but it is accessible to you. It is part of you. It is the expression of your soul. The more that you can express this part of you that is so deep, abiding and true, the easier it will be for you to navigate the world and to be truly in harmony with the world that God created, rather than that world created by man. I urge you forward, my friends. It is a choice. That accessibility to the soul consciousness is not that difficult, nor is it that far away. What is difficult is the patterns of your mind, the insistence of your mind to control the expression of your being and to be that deep, powerful response, reaction and expression with every moment of your life.

You must change. Turn the tides, my beloved friends. May the Living Waters that reside within your soul be that which soaks all consciousness, bringing into being the soul awareness, the beautiful light, the beautiful truth that resides within each one of you so that you are truly in alignment with all that is in harmony with the Laws of Love, the Laws of God’s creation. It is time to take that responsibility seriously, my friends, for the time does grow short. This leeway between now and the time of great action, of great expression, of great instrumentality is short, indeed. It requires your attention, a serious attention and effort.

We beseech you, my friends, to be in harmony with the truth you know within your soul, to express that harmony in every way, to be truly that being of light that you are, that struggles with that other side of you that is not so much of light. Still, even this side of you, of the mind, desires light. Comply with this desire. Honour it and live it. In this way, all your struggles and dilemmas will be as nothing. You will truly know the footsteps you must take, the efforts you must make in your life and how they will reflect the Will of God, the expression of love, light and harmony.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. I love you so, my beautiful friends filled with light, filled with light. Blessings to you. My love is with you. God bless you.
