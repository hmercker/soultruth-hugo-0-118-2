# You Are Making an Impact

On the Road Again, U.S.A

Received by Al Fike 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Andrew. I will say things that you already know, but it is important to remind yourself that when you travel like this and you meet these groups of dedicated souls, that you are reinforcing the bonds between you. You are making the community of Divine Love souls a real and viable entity by strengthening these bonds, by being in the flesh together, praying together, in the light together. Even if the Master was doing his work in this day and age, he too would travel. He too would embrace individuals in the flesh. He too would speak to them eye to eye, heart to heart, soul to soul. These things are important. 

Now it seems that many are detached and utilise these forms of communication that make it convenient not to make the effort and the time to be together in the flesh. Yet, that sense of humanity, of connection is lost in this somewhat sterile way of communication. It certainly has brought its benefits, but it also has brought a sense of isolation, a sense that what is happening amongst you as a group is not so palpable and real. So, we are very happy that you, my beloved travellers, are making that effort to connect, to embrace, to speak, to be a channel of love and for you to benefit as well from their efforts and love as you gather together. 

Do not underestimate the power and the purposefulness of your gatherings and of your efforts. Do you not feel how God is blessing you every step of the way? That all seems to run in a fluid and harmonious way, that your needs are met, and as you pray together that God blesses you so? All these are indicators of doing God’s work, of being in harmony with God’s Will. People need relationships, connection and love, and you are providing these things. You are reinforcing your relationships with them. Even the dear soul that you met yesterday was touched and feels acknowledged and seen. Though things did not go as you planned or anticipated, what was accomplished was a deep blessing for her and this was enough. The dear soul that resisted your connection will not, in time, and you will have other opportunities to make that connection. Nothing is a failure or misconstrued. All is well. All is well. 

So, you carry on in your great adventure and more things will come. More surprises will present themselves. More beautiful souls will come to be embraced and acknowledged. There will be deep conversations, spiritual seeking, collaboration and great light. I acknowledge you, my beloved four, for your efforts. Indeed, you have taken time from your lives to be used in this way. I know that there are some sacrifices and some inconveniences, but there are greater blessings and greater light for you, each one of you. So, we continue, my beloved friends. We continue on the road of service, of teaching, of praying, of blessing. 

God bless you. I am Andrew and I love you, each one so unique and so precious, so beautiful within your soul, so wondrous in your gifts, so blessed by God. God bless you. My love is with you. My love is with you.
