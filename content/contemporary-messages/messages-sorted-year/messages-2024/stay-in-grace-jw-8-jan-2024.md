# Stay in Grace

I am here, your brother in the love of God. I am Francis. May the gentle rain of God’s love fall upon you as you open your souls to the infilling of His love in this circle of light. 
   
A cup of kindness in this world produces a barrel of delight. As the love of God permeates your souls and harshness disappears, the sweetness of our heavenly Father’s Love begins to emanate from each one. As you stay in this grace, you do not react to the weight of the world, to whatever is thrown at you, out of anger, frustration, or grief. When you stay in this grace, you will respond with a gift that transcends the world, for it is a gift of love. 
   
I walked away from the material world and a material inheritance and at the beginning, there was much animosity towards me and my brothers. So we removed ourselves and we prayed, and then we prayed some more, until we were filled. And when we re-emerged into the world, we brought this sweetness of the love of God and often we could see nothing else but kindness and the more we served others without a second thought, the more the love filled our hearts and joy emanated from our souls. 

And if you think that this was a small thing, you would be mistaken, for what began as a simple act of going to God and taking on the vows of poverty brought great riches to many. This has not changed one iota in all the centuries. For the transformation of the soul transcends time, transcends place, and transcends all those things that divide humanity. This insight, when in grace becomes clear as day and opens ones’ eyes, opens ones’ hearts, to the world. 
   
If you could see beyond your circle with the eyes of your souls, you would see a great light shining through the darkness. You would feel the peace, and the bliss, and the joy, and I know many of you do. So, our simple message to you all is: *“stay in this grace.”* This grace that embraces the world in love, in gratitude, in humbleness. Allow this to change you.
     
It is helpful in very practical terms to awaken with a sense of gratitude each day, with a prayer of thanks, a prayer for God’s love, a prayer for service, and then to go about your day, however busy, in this joy, for you are a gift. 
    
It is always my great joy to come to my brother and speak in this circle in particular, because each soul that comes into this circle comes with the sincere longings and deep aspirations to be at one in the love of God and we honor you and we love you and God so loves you. May each one here share the grace of their souls with the world in the love of God.
     
I am your brother and friend in Christ. I am Francis. Go in peace.
