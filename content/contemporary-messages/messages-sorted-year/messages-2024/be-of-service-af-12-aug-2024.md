# Be of Service in the World

Received by Al Fike 

May the blessings of the Father enter into your souls, my beloved friends.  I am James and I come to pray with you today and to encourage you as well. To encourage you as you venture out into the world, to be that shining light that we so encourage you to be, that God wants you to be, a channel of love, a channel of light and healing, a channel for all things that are good and of God. God will use you as His instrument in many different ways, through many different circumstances, with many different souls. Each situation is unique. Each opportunity is unique. It is for you to be open, receptive, prayerful and seeking to serve God in all the ways that God wishes for you to serve. 

For how is light brought to the Earth, my beloved friends, but through His instruments, channels of love in the world? Those who sit and wait for inspiration and cannot move forward in dedication and service, will miss many opportunities that God will put before them. For every moment, every breath provides such opportunities, such ways to serve. You may feel inadequate or unable to discern what it is that you are to do. This is a human thing, part of the human condition. It is important for you to rise above that condition, to be in prayer and communion with God, to seek out His Love, to seek out the highest. As you do this, as you set your goals and your intentions forward with God, the inspiration will come. The guidance will flow and you will know the Will of God in your consciousness. 

I urge you to step forward. I counsel you to put aside your doubts and fears, to put aside that need to have mindful details, descriptions and instructions as to what you might do to serve God. For these things are not of the soul, but of the mind. Indeed, your goal and your intention is to be within the soul and to know the wisdom and understanding of the soul. This is your greatest challenge, to be in that place, so much in alignment with God. 

The soul is a reflection of God. The soul has the faculties and capacities that God has imbued within it that you might know your purpose and what purpose there is with any given day. I urge you to go to that place of soul, to put the mind aside and the parameters and ideas that are contained within it, to discipline yourself so that when, as our dear daughter has instructed, you go deep into the soul, you are aware and understand what it is to be in that place, what it is to feel it, to know it, to experience it on all levels of your awareness. 

As you pray for the great Love of God to enter into your soul and you empower your soul in this prayer, the faculties of your soul are enlivened and awakened. Your capacity to know the power of the soul, the blessings of the soul, the awareness and consciousness of the soul, come to the fore. You are not lost or wondering what it is that God wants of you. Rather, it becomes clear and forthright as you step forward. First and foremost, you must put your intentions toward service to be a channel of love in the world. No, you may not be consciously aware of what it is that you are doing, whether you are indeed serving God and serving humanity. You are in a state of action, of expression of love, light and blessings that may come through you. This is what is necessary. 

Though I urge you to be consciously aware, you may walk through life without that clear consciousness and that understanding and still be God’s instruments. It is in your relationship with God, your relationship with your soul, that this is made possible. Thus, for some of you, there is not the conscious awareness of what you do. Yet, you feel yourself within the flow and the grace that is God’s Will working through you. If that Will of God is expressed clearly, humbly, beautifully and gracefully through you, then indeed, you are being His instruments in the way that is needed and desired by God.
 
Each individual has their own level of perception and understanding of these things. Thus, the clarity and the unambivalence of serving God is not so present within your consciousness as it is with others. You must have faith. This is important, especially when that clarity does not exist, to have faith in what you do, who you are and your relationship with your Creator. This will be the link that brings you to God and brings you through that passageway of God’s Will working through you. It allows for the connection. It allows for the relationship to blossom as you grow in the Father’s Love, as you are imbued with this Love within. With it, comes greater faith, desire and intention to serve your fellow man.

So much is needed in the world, beloved souls, so very much. You are the link between God’s Will and the blessings that may come through your channel, your being, to others in the world. When you are in the flow of God’s Will, in the grace of God’s Touch, all seems effortless and flows with grace and harmony. This is what is needed to be in that grace and to serve with love for your brothers and sisters and to be that individual of light, that person of grace and beauty. 

With God’s Hand upon you, His blessings within you, flowing forth as a great beacon of light, so you will be His instruments, but you must be in the world. in the world, my beloved and beautiful friends. Do not hide away in the safety of being cloistered within your own place with God. There are times when this is important and necessary, but there are times when you must step forth into the world. Be God’s instruments in the world and God will guide you so upon the world. There will be grace, blessings, fulfilment and a deep knowing that you are, indeed, serving God and serving humanity in love. 

These things come as you grow within your soul and awaken with this growth and transformation that comes in the Father’s Love. So, I remind you and encourage you to follow that road of service. No matter where you are, whether it be your work or whether you are walking down a street, whether you are within a situation such as you have at this moment, be that channel of love. Be God’s instruments and a light in the world. Many will benefit from this, many.
 
May you be blessed, my beloved and beautiful friends, in the ways that God’s blessings flow to you and through you, constant and bright, powerful and transformative. God bless you, my friends. I am James. My love is with you all. God bless you.
