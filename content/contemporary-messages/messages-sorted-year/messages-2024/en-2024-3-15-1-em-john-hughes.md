# It Is All About the Love

March 15<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Online Prayer Circles, Liverpool, NY, USA

John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now. I am John, the beloved of this medium known as John Hughes. It is about love, is it not? How many expressions can there possibly be of love? The Father has created many unique souls with unique expressions, each one special. Into their hearts and souls, He blesses those who willingly open to receive His gift of Divine Love, that those souls' expressions may be greater, more loving, more true and more real.

It is our gift, our opportunity and our blessing to exercise this expression of love to our Heavenly Father, to our brothers and sisters, to those who live in the Celestial Heavens, to those who live high above close to God as bright spirits who do His bidding, to our brothers and sisters who are part of this great network of souls across the universe, to our brothers and sisters upon the earthly plane who are in the flesh and to those souls in the spirit world.

It is our privilege to express the love in our souls to each one, for God has declared it to be so. God has blessed us with this love and this love is to be shared widely, indiscriminately, with all the abilities and gifts that are within our souls. We are asked to go forward, wherever we live and in whatever sphere we reside. It is all about love. It is our purpose, our function and our true calling. God is the Source. Let us continue to pray, all of us together, and raise our longings to the Source of all Love, the Creator who bestows upon us this gift.

I am your brother, John Hughes. I thank you for allowing me to speak so passionately about this Love that our Father gives to us. God bless you all. I am your brother and I seek to uplift all of you, along with my brothers and sisters. God bless you.
