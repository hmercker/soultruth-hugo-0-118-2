I am Aaron. The truth is meant for all peoples, all races and creeds, for God's Love knows no boundaries in this regard. The truth was meant to be shared amongst the Jewish peoples of the time of Jesus. He did share what he could as he walked the Earth, sharing with his brothers and sisters, sharing in that part of the world. Many chose not to adhere to these truths, while others did. So, the religion of Christianity was born from the efforts of our beloved brother.

Indeed as you share these truths, do not concern yourself with who will aspire toward them and who will not. If you see your efforts from this perspective, often you will feel disappointed and you will see that many will not adhere to these truths. Yet, there are those who will and those who are dedicated toward it.
Beloved Mother Mary is true in her assertion that one will touch another, who will touch another. It happened in the day of her son and it will happen now, for there are enough of you who know this truth and, with dedication and aspiration, will bring this truth forward into the world.

Do not lose sight of this, those who are the apostles of truth. Be strong. Be clear in your objectives and do not put aside your faith and knowledge that you are truly God's instruments in the world. As you step forward into the world, God will guide you, protect you and God will show the way. This has always been the case and it shall be the case that God will guide you along the path of service, dedication toward truth and your efforts to share, to bring this truth in its simple form and the power of light that it brings. You will see, as you walk forward into the world, that this will be the case and you will be the instruments of truth in the world. 

Be of great faith. Trust in the Will of God and you will share. You will be that beacon of light, that harbinger of truth. It will flow unimpeded and clearly, powerfully, to others. Be true to God's Will. Be true to your soul's desire to bring the truth of His Love into yourself and into your brothers and sisters. You will find yourself on a path unimagined, but palpable and powerful in its expression.

May you be blessed. May you be blessed. I am Aaron. I walk with you and I will give you my strength. I will uphold you in love. God bless you. God bless you all.
