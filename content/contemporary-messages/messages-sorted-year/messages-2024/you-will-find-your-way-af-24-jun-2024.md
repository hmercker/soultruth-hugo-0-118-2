# You Will Find Your Way in This Journey of Awakening Through Mediumship

June 24<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

My friends, I am Seretta Kem. I shall be the one leading this development circle and orchestrating the various procedures and events that will take place in the next several days. Our first procedure will be to help harmonise all of you together, solidifying this group so that you may work together as a single entity rather than individual entities. For each of you is unique, of course. Each of you brings a certain energy and signature to this circle. Each of you have various gifts, combinations of gifts and thus, to coordinate and harmonise these various elements into one homogenous circle is our first challenge and our first effort.

You will feel yourself relaxing and blending into this energy condition, a sense of peace, a sense of harmony will ensue. I urge you to let yourself go into this condition that we will be creating, this peace that will come and to open your souls to the inflowing of the Divine Love. For this is the harmonising blessing that will bring you together. You will feel yourself merging and the flow of energy will circulate between you. You will feel a sense of movement of that energy one to the other. This serves as well to unify and connect each individual into the great structure of light, the beautiful circle of love that is your condition and your presence here combined with your brothers and sisters. 

We have much work to do, much ground to travel together. Each of you will find your way, the journey of awakening in this unique way of mediumship. The quality of mediumship and the type of mediumship will be dependent upon you and your qualities and condition. I urge you to be prayerful, to have great faith in what it is that we are doing together and to be in harmony with one another.  There will be peace and joy, upliftment and insights, perceptions and experiences. Much will take place together and we are very happy to be here with you. For those who have eyes to see, you will sense and visualise the great crowd of spirits that are around you, the power of the blessings that are bestowed upon you, your souls opening to this power. Our wish is that each and every one of you will truly be aware of your souls and allow your souls and your mindful consciousness to merge together into one entity during this time together.

It may feel somewhat strange for some of you and familiar to others. You are here all together as equals. You are all experiencing this as one entity, one body experiencing and seeing from each different perspective the events of the day. May you be blessed, beloved souls, blessed deeply, blessed fully. Open yourselves. Put aside any reticence. Be free within this safe and beautiful space created for you, for your benefit and your blessings, your development and awakening. God is giving you a great gift in this coming together. Utilise, take advantage of what is being given. Do not hold yourself back in any way. Know the joy of the Divine Touch upon you, awakening every part of you. Opening you to what can be the possibilities, the potentials that are within you, that which desires to be released and expressed, that which desires to be transformed and awakened, that which desires more of the great Love of God. All of these things come because you have come together seeking, seeking the great blessings, seeking a way to be of service, seeking to know yourselves more fully, seeking to be opened to gifts yet unrealised. 

My beloveds, I honour each one of you blessed souls who seek for the highest and desire to be utilised by God to bring blessings, peace, upliftment, comfort, love to your brothers and sisters who are in need. God is with us, His mighty Hand upon us all. So we will commune in the great Love of His Being and presence. God bless you. Seretta Kem loves you. I am close as are many. God bless you.
