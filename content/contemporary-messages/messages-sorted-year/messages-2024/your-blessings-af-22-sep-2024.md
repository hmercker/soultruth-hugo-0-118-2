# Your Blessings Will Not Be Forgotten: Closing Poughkeepsie Retreat

September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Poughkeepsie, NY, U.S.A

Received by Al Fike 

May you be nourished, beloved souls. You have come to the well and drunk the Living Waters. You have nourished one another. You have learned some lessons, some teachings. You have been blessed with healing and peace, and so it is when you come together for God. God brings His blessings in abundance and you are nourished by these blessings. Continue on your journeys toward nurturing your souls. Continue in your efforts to be together, to establish these bonds of love, to be united in the Truth of Love. In this way, you will be utilised by God to bring blessings for others. 

You will not forget your friendships, your relationships that have grown in these past few days. You will meet again, beloveds. You will meet again. As you journey forward, God will bring you together to nourish you and uphold you. Do not be downcast that you are parting from one another. Rather, be joyful that you have had this blessing of time, this blessing of many gifts and touches from God. God will continue to nurture you and uphold you. We will continue to be with you in prayer. As you continue to grow in love, the faculties and the gifts within your soul will come awake and you will find great benefit there. 

May you be blessed, beloved souls. May you be blessed in the greatness and glory of God’s Love. I am Peter and I come to bid you goodbye for now. Remember, you are never alone. You shall be with God and the angels, your stellar friends and bright spirits. A great retinue of light you shall carry with you. Know the peace that comes with the fulfilment of your souls in God’s Love, the light that comes from the efforts you have made together, the many, many blessings that continue to flow and be a part of your lives, your soul. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Peter. My love for you is great. My love for you is great. God bless you. God bless you, each one, in this gift of love, in this light of love and this peace of love. God bless you.
