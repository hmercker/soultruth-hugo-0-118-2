# Harmony, Love and Peace Are All Part of God’s Plan for His Children

John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am your brother, John Hughes and I have enjoyed this trip with you. The Earth is a beautiful place, and it is one of God’s creations, something special for the souls who come into this Earth who incarnate and individualize. With so much love, God created this planet. It is good. It is appropriate. It is God’s will that this planet be returned to a healthy, contributing condition and even more so as the souls upon the Earth receive more and more Divine Love. And as more souls come into this Earth who will be able to help in the transformation of this Earth.

Then it will become an environment filled with love and will attract love, more and more love from other souls from other planets. This connection will reinforce God’s love being expressed among His children. Although you will look different from others. They will look different to you. But this does not matter. You will come to know that it is the love that matters, and the love will become the greatest part of you as you progress your souls in this love. It is always about the love. God has declared it to be so, and God’s will is done throughout this universe and be joyful because of it.

For harmony and love and peace are all part of God’s plan for His children, wherever they live, wherever they’re born, wherever they go. It is part of God’s plan. Be thankful that God has chosen you, all of you, each of you to help in this transformation. It is a great privilege that you do not understand today to the full extent. But you will and your souls will rejoice when you do. God bless you, my brothers and sisters upon the Earth and in the spirit world. My love is with you as is the love of thousands of Celestial Angels who gather to pray with you and many brothers and sisters from other planets who pray with you. You are so blessed to be, and I say this in quotes, “the chosen ones” when really you are the ones who did the choosing. May God bless you. May God bless you continuously. I am your brother, John Hughes, and I live in the Celestial Heavens nearer my Father than I did previously because progression is forever. God bless you.
