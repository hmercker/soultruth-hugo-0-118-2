# The Gift of Timeless Love 

July 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your brother in Christ, Khalil. What a wonder that you have set aside the world this time to allow your soul, your timeless soul, to be opened to the love of God and the guidance of the angels. The memory of yesterday brings the heart into the moment and the longing of tomorrow reaches out in the now. For, though the world lives in past, present, and future, the soul is always in the now. 

When the grace of God awakens your soul, you bring each moment on your walk to others, touching them with the forever now of the great love of the Creator. For, do you not set aside time for many things? This is the way of the world and yet, when you are in your soul, you are always in the now. You can see this in the play of children, without a thought about anything except the moment of enjoyment in each otherâ€™s company, in play. You can feel it in the notes from a musician immersed in a divine melody. 
   
All things conspire to bring you into your soul and into the timeless love that is yours for the asking. For, does not the love of God transcend all worldly things and yet blesses them in the forever now? 
  
When you open as a child to the play of God without a care, without a concern, time slips away. Has not every lover felt this timeless embrace with their beloved, wondering where did the time go, wishing this moment of bliss would last? And so, it is. 
   
The gift of Divine Love is an eternal gift. And though you may ebb and flow in your mind and in your lives, as this love enters your soul, you move exponentially to the now, to the joy. What a wonder is the presence of God, the teachings of the King, every brother and sister coming together in this love. 
  
I step back in this moment of now to be with you in timeless prayer in the eternal love of God. I thank you. I am your brother in the love of God, in Christ. I am Khalil Gibran.
