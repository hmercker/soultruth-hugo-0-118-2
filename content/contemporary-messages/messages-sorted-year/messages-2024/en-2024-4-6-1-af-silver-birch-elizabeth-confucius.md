# Honoured to Work with the Manly Circle of Light

April 6<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Manly Circle og Light, Manly, Australia

Silver Birch, Elizabeth & Confucius received by Al Fike

**Silver Birch:** That message was conveyed many years ago, my friends. I am Silver Birch. Indeed, depending upon the medium chosen and spoken through, the concepts, the language, the words, the truth is determined by that individual. Indeed, we are pleased, and were very pleased at that time, to have those who were willing to sit together in circles such as this so that we may communicate. We are willing to do so once again.

The day of communication is by no means over, my friends. It is merely the beginning. The beginning of that which must come to humanity. An understanding of spiritual laws and spiritual perspectives so that humanity may gain greater insight into what life is all about. Few truly understand. Few truly have the capacity to see and to comprehend the vastness of this universe created by the Creator.

Yet, each one of you are seekers. You wish for truth. You wish to know the deeper aspects of that which is within you. That world, and that which is all around you. You come together diligently and with great dedication to be in the light, the light of truth, the light of understanding, the light of love. This draws us close. I am but one of many, many who have worked with you for many years. Each of you have your guides, your gatekeepers, your spirit friends who are eager to continue to connect in a deeper way, that you may understand in a deeper way. That your souls may be of great light. That your consciousness may be that of spirit, which you are. Deeply, deeply within you is a great spiritual force, a great light, and that which you need to know and align yourself with.

How might you do this, my friends? You must do this through allowing yourself to be open, to put aside your mental clutter, to be with the Creator of all. In this openness and innocence comes the great flow of love, knowledge and truth that is available to every individual, provided they are willing to walk this road toward greater light. It is the desires within you, my friends, that determine the path you take. It is the language that you carry, that which you have read, that which you have absorbed, that which you believe that often determines the course that you will take. Yet, true spirituality has no language, has no book. It is of the heart, the soul and the mind together, seeking for the highest of truths, the most beautiful of blessings from God, your Creator, who loves you beyond measure.

We all serve the one God. We all serve the Creator of all. We wish for you to be in alignment with this. For as this alignment is forged, and it has been forged for many years, we may utilise you as a force of light in this material world. Something that is sorrowfully needed, my friends. Something that you may participate in and be a part of the efforts that we all make to uplift humanity, to bring humanity closer to that light, that purity, that beauty which is your true spiritual nature and being.

For humanity is on the road. Every soul, every individual, no matter where they are at this moment in time, what condition they carry, whether that be light or darkness, in time will find light, will find truth. The road may be circuitous, indeed. But that road, nonetheless, must be taken by each individual. The choice made, the effort applied, the seeking satisfied by whatever means that might take.

Do not judge your fellow man for what they believe is true and yet, you do not see it as truth. Rather, understand that the steps that they take are their own. The steps may not be of truth or fully of truth, but there is effort made toward truth. That effort, in time, will bring great realisation and satisfaction to the soul, the true being that exists within you that will exist forever. So, you make your road. You make your efforts, my friends. Each one of you in your own way. Each one is precious in the light, in the life that you have created by your efforts, in the light that God has placed upon you in His efforts, in the glory of the communion of your beautiful being with us, with the Creator, with the universe. All of these layers and levels of understanding merge together into one consciousness of light and truth that will bring you great joy, my friends. You will come to understand the power of love to unify, to heal, to uplift and to teach.

Within God is Divine Love, the Essence of the Creator of all. This awaits each one of you as a gift. As you merge in this consciousness with God, as you seek with openness,  innocence and desire to be at-one with the Creator, you will know this Love, this Light that beams forth and is given to your soul as a gift each time you reach for it, each time you open yourself to it. It comes and heals, reclaims and transforms your very being from that of the coarseness of human life and conditions to that which is of the Divine. It can be given with any supplication and desire. It is simple, yet powerful and profound in its implications for your journey, your spiritual awakening, your light. Seek and it shall be given, a blessing from God to you. We seek this blessing and we urge you to also seek in this simple prayer that says, *“I am your child and I seek to grow in Your Love, to be in alignment with the truth of Your Love, to be all that I am meant to be in the awakening that comes with Your Love. Beloved God, Creator of the universe, we are here now. We are unified. We are in the light of the blessing of the universe of love.”*

God bless you, my friends. I am Silver Birch and my love is with you. I have been with you often. When you read these passages, you draw me close. Not only I, but many. Many, many who are on this earthly plane in spirit seek for solace, comfort, light and truth. So, they are drawn. You draw them with your desires to help and assist. Also, many who are on the earthly plane who are connected with each one of you, families, loved ones, associates. Many, many benefit from your efforts. Continue to persist, my friends. In this persistence, when that time comes when you pass into our side of life, you will see with the eyes of your spiritual self the work that you have accomplished and how this work, though seemingly humble, is powerful and has reached many, many. You will find this to be true. Have faith in what you do. Trust in the efforts you make. Accept that each of you are being guided and you follow the path that has been designated, and partly because you have chosen and you desire this.

Thank you for hearing from me today. We have brought this instrument to you in order to speak of these things and reassure you that what you do together is important. What you do to seek out the truth, to be in the highest light, vibration and love is what is needed. You are urged to carry on, my beloved friends. Carry the light. Be a torch of light, a beacon of light in the world so very needed, so very needed.

May the blessings of the universe continue to be yours, my friends. Know that I am close and that I love you all so dearly. I know you all so very well, as do many. Blessings to you. Blessings, light and peace to each of you, beloved friends.

**Elizabeth:** I am Elizabeth, and I come as a child, a little girl to you. I work with your beautiful circle to help you, uplift you and to bring light and healing to each of you. Do any of you know me? I want you to know me and to understand that many of us come to help you. But also, to help many others through you in this world of yours. These Circles of Light are so precious and so few, so we put great effort. Beautiful, beautiful light pouring forth in this circle, it overflows and touches those outside of this circle. Many, many souls in need of peace, in need of reassurance and love. So, we give these things. We use you as channels and instruments of light to do this work. You are beautiful and I am so very pleased and honoured to work with each of you to bring the light forth, to uplift and be blessed.

I am your friend, Elizabeth, and I will make every effort for you to know me in times to come. God bless you in love, in love. The most important thing of all is love.

**Confucius:** I too, come into your circle. I am Confucius and I bring a gift of healing for each one of you, beloved souls, a gift of healing and upliftment. Great dedication is here amongst you, persistence and love. Oh, how the world could do with many circles like this where you may draw in the forces of the universe, the blessings of the Creator, the light for this world so dark, so dark. Yet, here the light shines like the sun. How beautiful, how beautiful, beloved souls, how beautiful.

God bless you. I am Confucius. I add to the light, indeed, indeed.
