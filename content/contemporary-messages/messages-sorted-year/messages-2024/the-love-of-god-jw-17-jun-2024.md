# The Love of God has already conquered the World

My dear friends, I thank you for coming together as you do to receive the great gift of God’s love, setting aside this time in a quiet place, in trust, in faith; letting the world go for these moments that your souls may rise above whatever your concerns are and asking the Creator, our most loving God, to fill our souls through His holy spirit which brings the love and infills us. 
   
It is said one should not hide their light, or as it is sometimes written, put your lamp under a table, and this may seem incongruous with another statement requesting one not to be like the hypocrites who boast and pray in public. Yet in the context of a soul in grace, these two things are not opposed to one another. When you shine your light upon the world, you shine it with the love in your soul and this does not require one to boast or to proselytize their beliefs in a way that others may not understand. And when you love the world, you lift the vibrations of those around you, and sooner or later they begin to wonder: *"what is this person’s practice that brings this love to all, wherever they go, whatever they do?"* You not shouting from the rooftops, but walking the earth in love, in the humility and presence that is of God. For the world may or may not receive you, but God has already received you and His touch is upon you. 
   
It has been said by the Master: *“My kingdom is not of this world”* and yet, while you are in the world praying for this love to fill your souls, you have already taken a step into Heaven and the celestial realms where the love of God, in all its effulgence is pervades the atmosphere. So we come to you with all the love in our souls, with all the compassion, and understanding of your trials, of your challenges, of your grief, and of your triumphs, for the love of God has already conquered the world, and your reward will be great. 
   
In the meantime, persist in your prayers. As I have said many times, without a thought, open your heart that God may open your soul, that His love may permeate your entire being and lift you up. This we so wish for you, each one a precious soul, beloved by God and all of us here in the celestial realms. 
  
Take heart. Be of good cheer. Embrace the world with all your heart. Be not troubled and walk this way in joy, in peace, and in the presence of our glorious Creator, Who loves us so.
     
I thank you. I am your brother in Christ. I am Judas, once of Kerioth, now a redeemed soul and a celestial angel, and your eternal friend who loves you. May God bless you. Go in peace. Go in peace.
