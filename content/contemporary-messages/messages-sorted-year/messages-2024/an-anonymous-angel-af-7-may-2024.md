God bless you, beloved souls. I come to bring healing blessings to each one of you. My name is Naari. You do not know of me, but I am a member of the Celestial Kingdom. Though my life was lived in obscurity, there are many of us who live in that exalted place who have made our way through all the trials and tribulations of life and the challenges of the spirit world, having found our hearts opening to God and awakening to His blessings. 

You dear and beloved souls, each one living a life that is simple, you are not famous or exalted in the eyes of others. But still, in the eyes of God, you are exalted and loved. Continue to see your life in this vein and this light. For as long as you are willing and able to receive the great blessings of God, to receive His Love and accept it, to know that you are worthy of this blessing, then you are living an exalted life. You are living in the grace of truth and you will come to know the joy and blessings of this as you continue to progress within your soul. 

My beloved friends though you do not know me, I know you. Many of us who are somewhat anonymous to you know you well. For we are the ones who come to minister to you, my beloved friends. We are the ones, the many, who God has guided and decreed that we will be with you on Earth to help support and protect, heal and uplift. We are the ones that put in the hours and hours to support you. We spend time away from our beautiful homes, places so filled with light, love and joy, and here we are with you, my beloved friends. Indeed, we sacrifice much in order to be with you. But we are not resentful. We do not complain. Indeed, we are given the gift of service to our brothers and sisters on Earth. In this way, we are blessed as well. 

There is a great tide of truth coming to your world. We come as the beachhead of this light to help envelope, strengthen, and protect you as you continue to explore the truth, to test the truth and to live the truth in your lives. Know that we are there. The many are there, many that you do not know, you do not recognise, you do not see. Yet, we are there and shall always be there. For God provides His beautiful angels to be in your midst as you continue on this journey, seeking and receiving the great Love of God. It is the law expressed in action and applied as you continue to seek the truth in your hearts and souls with sincerity and dedication. We are with you with our sincerity and dedication, our love for each one of you.

Indeed you know of the great figures of history that come to be with you and to speak to you and to bless you. This is because it is easier for you to recognise these individuals and to accept these blessings. Because your mind has fixed within it the idea and the likeness of those beautiful and exalted souls. But I wish for you to consider us. We are no less in the light than they are, but we are not known because your minds do not know us, do not recognise us. So, I make this effort today. I have been allowed to speak to you today of our efforts and our commitment. Acknowledge us in your prayers and we will come close. You will in time come to see us and know us and we will be friends, friends in the Truth of Godâ€™s Love. 

May God bless you deeply. I am Naari. I come from an island that these two dear souls passed by, though I have not lived upon that island for many, many years. Indeed, I live with you all in my ministrations, in my service, my love for God demonstrated in this. I have no regrets. I am joyful in my service and in the ways and means that I might come and be with you in loving embrace, using my gifts to bless you. Beloved souls, I love you. I love you. I love you. God bless you. God bless you all.
