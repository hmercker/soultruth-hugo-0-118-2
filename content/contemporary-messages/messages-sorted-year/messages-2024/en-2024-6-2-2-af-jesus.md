Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Orion is a dear and beloved friend of mine and I am your friend. I am Jesus and I come to acknowledge his efforts on your behalf. I come to assure you that his presence is real and what he has to say is of truth. As you have seen and witnessed, there are great forces in the universe of light. There are great efforts being made to assist and uplift our beautiful planet and all within it. If you could see and know this, you would be overwhelmed with gratitude, with waves of tears of joy, acknowledging how precious each and every one of God’s creation is. Each and every beautiful planet inhabited in the universe is loved by God and nurtured by God.

When one planet falters, as this one is, then great forces rush in to assist, to save, to uplift and to heal, all done in love. Love is the great bonding force in the universe. Love is what brings you together. The great Source of Love, which is God’s Soul, is that which will heal and transform. How blessed we all are to have life, to be given this gift of life, to walk in the world as a living, breathing being and walk in my world as a spirit resplendent in light and all that is in between, blessed and double blessed with the great efforts of spirits, angels and what you call your stellar friends. So much in the way of blessings is given, freely and abundantly.

It is for you to attune yourself, my beloved friends, with all that is of God. That which is of God is immense, expansive and awesome. Allow yourself to be a part of it. Open yourself to it and be truly in alignment with God. We are here to assist you, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens, and I shall walk with you for eternity, beloveds. For each of you are destined to enter into the Celestial Kingdom at some point.

You begin your journey, many steps from that point of entry. Yet, do you not feel joy with each step? Do you not feel that you have purpose and direction, understanding much of which helps you in your daily life? Yes, you are being upheld and you are being blessed. In this, you are also being used as God’s instruments to uphold and bless others. What a wondrous universe God has created. It is filled with so much you do not know of yet, but that knowing will come in time.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. May you be blessed and all that is good and in harmony with truth, love and light. God bless you. My love is with you always. God bless you.
