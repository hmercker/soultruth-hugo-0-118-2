# It Takes a Crew 

September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am Fred Rogers. Won’t you be my neighbor? Is this not a neighborhood? Is this not a family? You know I also wish to say hello to my dear friend Phil and let him know his father is in a degree of light in the spirit world and very interested in what he is doing. 
  
So, the Master came, and I was with a large, large group of souls listening to His message and message the from Aaron, also the one about the *‘Wee Ones’* <sup>1</sup> which attracted me because I work with the children crossing over, and I love this work as I did on earth. 

But I really wish to tell you this today; when I started my work in TV, a prayerful work I might add, every morning praying for guidance, going for a swim like my brother here, having a family, I considered what do I want to bring to the world, and will they approve it? And we started out with a relatively small crew and as my guidance resonated with that crew, we were able to bring many issues to the public, present many different types of people in many different situations, many cultures.  

I was fortunate to be able to provide the music for the show, which brought me great delight. But I tell you, behind the scenes are many, many people, and imagine you watch a film, and someone is the main character, and they get accolades, maybe an academy award, there are hundreds of people involved in that production. There are many people involved in editing a book, putting it out there, marketing it; anyway, you get my gist, yes? 
  
So, this morning, when you’re being asked to bring this great truth of God’s love to the world and maybe wondering how will this happen? And of course, you will pray for guidance, and you will get prompts and as you do now, you will follow that guidance to the best of your ability. But please remember, you have a community. This is your crew. 

For however big or small you wish to create in God’s love, everyone can contribute. It takes a community. It takes a crew. And though you may have one person doing music or receiving a message or writing a screenplay, making travel arrangements, or whatever it is, it takes all of this to bring this message to the world. So, my very simple point is: make use of each other, make use of your spiritual family. For all wish to serve and when asked and able to serve, one experiences immense gratitude for being able to help another.  And as you know, when you truly serve another, the blessings are greater than the one you have served, and you build up your treasure on this side. 
    
Please remember to suspend your judgement, embrace all in the love of God, and remember the children. So important that the children be blessed because they are the future and as was said, sometimes the parents are not there, or they’re otherwise engaged. So, this is not just for those who have children but to remember the world’s children and the greater message is that in God’s love we are all His children. 
   
I thank you and I am honored to come and speak with you all. I am your brother and friend in the love of God, in Christ. I am Fred Rogers. Go with God.

**Al speaking to Fred Rogers** Mr. Rogers, can I ask what sphere you’re in now?

**Fred responding to Al** Oh, thank you. I am in the fifth sphere and they tell me I am going to progress to the seventh very soon and I have spent a lot of time here because I am able to do the work I do which is often children entering from a lower sphere who are traumatized, who are victims of abuse, who are orphans, and I am able to bring them my love and my light and at the same time, progress.  I am guided by celestial angels as you are and they have allowed me to come and speak today and I tell you, the fifth sphere may not seem very high to those of you who know of the celestial heavens, but it is a realm of light and love and beauty beyond compare.

**Al speaking to Fred Rogers** Thank you.

**Fred Rogers responding to Al** You’re welcome.

**Phil speaking to Fred Rogers** Thank you Mr. Rogers. This means so much to me.

**Fred Rogers responding to Phil** Well, you’re welcome, dear Fred.
