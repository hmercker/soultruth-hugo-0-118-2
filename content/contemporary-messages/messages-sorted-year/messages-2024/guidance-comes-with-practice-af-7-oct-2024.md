I am Keea Atta Kem. â€ŠIt is both an art and a science to finesse the Will of God into your consciousness, to bring an understanding to you in such a way that you are able to act upon God's Will in your life. When you have sufficient faith and desire to serve God, then God will, indeed, provide the ways and the means of service. But, when there is a rudimentary understanding that needs to be developed, opened and awakened as the soul grows in the Father's Love, then the quality and quantity of guidance is often inhibited by the development of the soul, its ability to listen and hear, as well as the inclinations of the mind and its desire to listen and hear. 

It takes time to develop these insights, this communication between yourself and God, between yourself and us. As you persist, as you continue to open, the power and beauty of these communications will strengthen and flower into something wondrous and very practical in its application. God does not make His Will elusive or complicated. Indeed, it is for you to set aside the mindful distractions in order to hear His Will and know it, to feel it, to understand it.

These things come in time, beloved daughter, and you will find your way as you continue to seek out your Creator, receive the gift of His Love. As you continue to have more confidence and faith in your own soul's ability to know God's guidance, then it comes clearly and beautifully. As the soul's perceptions awaken, the faculties come to life. These things come more readily and they will come with an urgency and a power. You will find that your priorities will change. Your desire to serve will intensify. All will flow in accordance to the Father's Will in your life. 

God does not ask you to do that which you cannot do. God asks you to do that which you can do and are able to do. In doing it, you will know a harmony and a peace in the act of fulfilling God's Will of being in service to others. All moves in harmony. When the great gift of the Father's Love grows within your soul, you find the peace that passes all understanding and you know God's Will clearly and succinctly, coming to you in many ways, through many avenues of inspiration and communication. It all flows in love. Love is the key. For without your soul awakened in love, it is still deaf and dumb to the understanding and Will of God. 

You will find your way, beloved daughter, as all of you find your way, your ways and means of knowing, of experiencing God's Touch upon you and God's Will acting through you. God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea-Atta-Kem. I love each one of you, beautiful souls seeking to serve God, seeking to be a light shining, seeking to be a channel of love in the world. So it shall be, my friends. So it will be, as you progress forward in the truth. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
