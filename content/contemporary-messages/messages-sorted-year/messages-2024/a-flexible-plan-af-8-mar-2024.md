My friends, I am your teacher Augustine. We have a plan for this time together, this place and those who are coming to this place. Our hope is that you will be open and receptive to the flow of individuals, the connections to be made and the efforts to be made on our behalf as God blesses all within this flow of humanity. Although there is some need for planning, remember that in God's flow and plan there is a harmony and a fluidity to it. Thus it is important to be open and receptive, to be at peace and to allow. 

My son (P), you are very disciplined in many ways. You are attuned to your mindful efforts and ideas as to what is important in your life. Indeed this has made you a successful man upon this material plane because you are able to follow through with the ideas and intentions that you have. You are very disciplined within the mind. You have a certain amount of discipline of the soul. Our hope is that you will find out about a different kind of discipline, a different kind of effort and awakening so that you may progress in a rich and wondrous way within your soul. That it may be conscious and that you may have those experiences that you yearn for. It is our hope that we will assist you in opening up in this way. 

Dear daughter (C), you are very different, indeed, from your mate. Those yearnings and openings of the soul are more readily available to you in a conscious way. It is our hope that you will pray with us as often as you might. That there will be a lovely collective, a bonding, of working together in this blessed time. The time is short, so we must make the most of this time. We shall, indeed we shall. 

It is fortuitous that our dear daughter wishes that you pray twice a day, to come together in this Circle of Light. Whether it be with others or just the four of you is not an issue. There are no impediments to a prayer such as this or one that is larger. We will pray together as our hope and be together in loving harmony and peace, sharing of one another in the ways of the soul, increasing the bond, strengthening the Lattice of Light. That in times to come you will be very connected, where there is no need to travel these great distances. 

Yes, there is much work to do. Of course as you continue to open yourself to the inflowing of God's Love, so you facilitate all of these things, strengthening the foundation of the truth within your lives. Each one of you has many gifts to be realized or recognized. Each of you is very blessed by God. You live a life that is blessed. The light that you carry, each one, is shared together, a blending of beautiful gifts and lights together. 

May you continue to awaken to God's Love, to see the power and know the glory of this gift and how it does indeed enhance everything, expand everything and bless everything. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine. I come to begin to introduce this beautiful opportunity, this blessing, this time together. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with each one of you. God bless you.
