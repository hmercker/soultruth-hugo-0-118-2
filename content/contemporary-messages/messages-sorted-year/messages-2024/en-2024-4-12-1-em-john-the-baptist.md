# Within Jesus Was Something More Sacred

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here with you now. I am John the Baptist, and I come frequently these days. I am close to you, to all of you who pray that God fills your souls mightily with His love. Your prayers draw me close. Your intentions for this love for your brothers’ and sisters’ redemption brings me close to you.

For I, too once when I walked upon the Earth, spoke of redemption to my brothers and sisters who did not always listen. But some did and yet, the redemption that I taught was not of the redemption that our beloved Master, Jesus, taught and when I said that I was not worthy to loosen his straps, I spoke in earnestness. For I knew that within him was something more powerful, more sacred than anything that had previously been on the face of this Earth. You could feel his light. His love was great. His passion for God was beyond what most of us could understand and now, I am in the Celestial Heavens with my dear cousin and brother and Master. And now, I understand better that it is this love, this Essence of God within our souls that burns so brightly, so strongly that reaches out to touch every other soul with such love, such compassion, such earnestness.

I say to you, my dear young brothers and sisters upon this path, pray. Pray more. Long for this love. Long in the deepest parts of your soul for this Divine Essence of the Father. It shall bring you closer, quickly, truly and open your souls that you may receive it as it is all about you at this time. Our Father sheds His love, pours His love upon us now. My love is with you, my dear young souls upon this path. Drink up. Drink up the Father’s love and may He bless you mightily and be open consistently, continuously to receive His blessings. May God bless you. May the Father’s love ignite your souls even more than it has already done.

I am John, John the Baptist and my love reaches into each of your souls.
