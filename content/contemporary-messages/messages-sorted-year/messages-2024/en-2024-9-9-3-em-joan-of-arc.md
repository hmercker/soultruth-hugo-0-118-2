# One Must Focus on One’s Purpose on the Divine Path

September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Indianapolis, IN, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Joan, Joan of Arc as you know me. To the point, when one travels this road, one must focus on one’s purpose and that purpose is found in God, that communion with God brings forth one’s purpose, not to be distracted, not to be misled, but to intend to fulfill its purpose. Yes, the greater mission of one’s life upon the Earth and yes, part of that purpose is to receive the Father’s life-giving, life sustaining Divine Love and to that end you have been successful and must continue to be successful. Then, there is the outcome of that receiving of this Love. The outcome being, deeper purpose that the Father has for each soul. It is up to you, children, to reach down into your souls and commune with God to bring forth that deeper purpose of expression of your soul, all that’s within there to be expressed by this love.

I hope I am not too vague for you, for I am trying to communicate that you are ready to step forward in a deeper way, in a profound way and the most loving way possible for your time upon this Earth. I speak to you all, not just this one who speaks. There is a deeper purpose and a deeper longing to serve the Father in the way the Father desires you to serve. Come together with God deep in your soul and affirm the truth of what has been said and what it is that you are to do to complete your commitment to God upon this Earth. I am your sister in this holy trek towards God, our Creator and Father and I bless you with the love that I have and the gifts that I have and the willingness that I must walk with you. May God bless you and fervently I hope that you open to these deeper longings and missions. May God bless and my love is with you and will always be with you. I am Joan, your sister in love.
