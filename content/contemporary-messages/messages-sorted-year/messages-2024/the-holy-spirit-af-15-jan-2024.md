The gift of love is upon you, my friends. I am Bartholomew. It is for you to open yourselves and receive it with gratitude and joy. It is the beginning of the redemption of the soul, bringing the soul at-one with God, transforming the soul from image to substance. I am happy to see you all gathered here today. We have been working diligently to influence and encourage individuals to come and join in this Circle of Light. There are many more that we are working with on your island. We have much to give to these individuals and to you. I encourage you to gather the souls together in the flesh and pray together. 

We are not concerned about differences of perspective and religious ideals. We are here to gather souls. Souls do not have the perspective of the mind. Souls are eager to be with God. The only impediments are those who have mindful biases and restrictions to this very blessing and activity. I urge you to grow these groups. They will be a great strength in the future. They will draw many who are seeking and many who are lost. You will have the Touch of God upon you, uplifting you, healing you, loving you. 

If you do not falter and walk with faith, my beloved friends, you will find that God will draw the souls to you, inspire you to speak and invite them into your midst. I will be there with you. My love, the love of a Celestial Angel, will help to melt the hardened hearts and the fearful minds and bring them close. This is God's work, beloved souls. This is the work of the angels. It can be your work provided you subscribe to it and you pray to be used as God's instruments in the world. Indeed, each of you here, in some way, some capacity, have been an instrument of God in service for another. Some of you have been instruments of God in every day and in many ways. 

Here in the Circle of Light, you come for replenishment, healing and upliftment. You come with a collective desire to receive the great gift of God's Love. You come because, as has been said, birds of a feather will flock together. Here you are together, kindred souls upon a journey towards truth. You are blessed beloved souls, in many ways. You shall be blessed in many ways. The upliftment will be great. You will feel the Touch of God upon you. You will feel and know your souls opening to the great gift of His Love and feel the peace, joy and blessings that come with this. It is not difficult to receive this gift. It is merely applying the Laws, the Laws of Love and witnessing the effects of your application. You are blessed. Yearn for this gift. Feel it and know it. As you know this, your faith will increase. Your knowledge will increase. Your light will increase in the great blessing of the Father's Love. 

I am Bartholomew. My love is with you. The love of the angels surrounds you. The Holy Spirit touches your soul as you commune with God. This is a holy time. A time of respite of the body and the mind, and the enlivening of the soul as God touches you deeply in this formidable, powerful touch that comes in prayer. God bless you. God bless you all in love.
