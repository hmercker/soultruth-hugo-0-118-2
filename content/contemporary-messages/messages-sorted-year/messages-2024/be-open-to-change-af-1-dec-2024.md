# Be Open to Portals of Change 

December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Received by Al Fike 

I am your teacher, Augustine. In the coming times you will find that God will open portals of possibilities and change within your lives that will bring greater light. I urge you to pray for this to be so. I urge you to be receptive to whatever changes may come in your lives. Some of these changes will be dramatic and others will be very subtle indeed, but the shifting of your life, the shifting of the conditions around you and the mental processes that you carry will help you to come into greater light in your lives. This will help you to see more clearly, to understand more deeply and to love more fully. 

As your soul awakens in the Father's Love, so these changes must come. The Law is obeyed and comes invariably to each one. As you seek greater light and greater harmony in your lives, these changes will come. Some you will welcome with open arms. Others, you may feel somewhat cautious, even fearful. But, I say to you that if you are strong enough and brave enough to enter through that portal of change, then you will reap the benefits and the rewards of these blessings. You will see how that change had been for the better, that you would have continued to be mired within your old selves and conditions. 

In the change there is an opportunity, a vitality and an impetus to change and to be in greater harmony with the Laws of Love. Be receptive, beloved souls. Your angel friends work diligently to help bring the opportunities forth, so that your lives may change for the better and that your inner selves may be in greater harmony with God. Embrace change, beloved souls and know that in love, change is a blessing and needed to continue progress toward greater light.

God bless you, my beloved and beautiful students. I am your teacher, Augustine and I love you dearly. I am with you. I shall continue to guide, uphold, inspire and to bless each of you, as I know each one of you and have been close at times. God bless you. God bless you deeply, dearly and fully.
