# We Have Brought You Together For a Purpose

September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Lansing, MI, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

You have us, with protection all around, uplifting you, bringing you blessings from your Heavenly Father. I am Joan, Joan of Arc, and I speak through this medium who knows me well. We have brought you together. You have felt urges to join this group, to join in prayer, to join in the Love that the Father blesses each one of you with. You have come here for a purpose. One that has been with you from the time that you were created, and now is the time to fulfil that purpose.

First of all, by continuing your growth as a Divine Love soul, offering your love in every situation to every person. Whether or not you know them or agree with them, your role is to love. Your purpose is to love. It is your Father’s Will. You have come here willingly to do the Father’s Will, which is to love your brothers and sisters,to raise the emanations upon this Earth at this crucial time, to help birth a new way, a new beginning, to correct the old way, the harmful way and to bring forth the new children of God, the Divine children of God, that all may be healed, that the Earth may be healed, that you each may be healed.

Give your love, children, at every moment, in every way. Bless those who come your way with the love that you have. Bless those you do not know with your love. There is no time, there is no space to this Love that the Father gives to you. So, break out of your preconceived ideas. Break out and open to God’s Love and heal yourselves and all of mankind. I am your sister, Joan. I, and many others who are here, lift you up and extend our love to you. For it is the Father’s Will that we do so, and it is our will that we do so. Our love is with you and will always be with you. May God bless you, each and every one. May god bless you.
