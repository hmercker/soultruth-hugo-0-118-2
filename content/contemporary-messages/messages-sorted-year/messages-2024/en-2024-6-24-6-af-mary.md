Mary received by Al Fike

I am Mary. Now that we have gathered you together, we bring a healing balm of peace to help you recover from your journeys. We bring you upliftment and light so that when you return on the morrow, you will be refreshed and ready to begin with our program of blessings and development. Our hope is that you will sleep well tonight. Dream of things that are of God and of the angels. Be well-blessed in your sleep state.

God bless you, beloved souls. You are surrounded in love. You are surrounded in light. You shall be blessed accordingly, as the angels minister to you and God blesses all of us. We are with you. We will be by your side for the entire time. You are safe and protected, uplifted and blessed. Know this deep within your heart and feel at peace, beloved and beautiful children of God. My love is with you, always with you. We shall continue tomorrow with our efforts. God bless you. God bless you all.
