# The Power of Divine Love Is a Great Responsibility

November 5<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Rock Hill, SC, USA

Peter & Samuel received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Peter. I follow my Master, who is Jesus who is Master of the Celestial Heavens and I come to tell you what you may already know: that your faith has brought you further, higher than when you started this prayer; that your longings for God’s love has brought you higher. We angels come to support these desires but it is your desires and your longings and your relationship with God that raises you above the human condition.

I tell you this so that you understand that the empowerment of being raised above the human condition lies in your own souls because of this gift, this great gift that the Father has bestowed upon you in very great abundance with your continued prayers over the years. And these prayers, we know, will continue because this love does not end and the desire for this love continues to grow in your souls and with it grows the faith, the faith that you will exhibit in every situation that you encounter if you so choose to exhibit it.

What I am telling you, dear children of God, is that you have power within your souls, the power of Divine Love. We ask that you take in this, I will call it a revelation, deeply. Pray to God to acknowledge that you have this power within you and faith within you to not only raise above the human condition but to help others raise above the human condition as well. Pray on this, dear souls, so that you fully comprehend and experience  this truth that I am honored to give to you. My love is with you. I am your brother, Peter, the first Apostle, the Rock as I have been called that my Father’s church was built upon. May God bless you and you are always being watched over and cared for. God bless you.

I am Samuel and I too come to tell you that this power that Peter speaks of is given in love and is always expressed in love. Remember who you are. You are true children of the Creator. Your love can heal. Your love can attract others to this path. It is a great responsibility so pray deeply that you exercise this gift, may I say, judiciously. My love is with each one of you. I, too, am your brother, Samuel and may God protect you always.
