# Take in Deeply Truths Given by God

April 25<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

Josephus received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Josephus. I, as you know, was a philosopher a very long time ago and now, I don’t philosophize. I know. I know that God is real, is One. I know that God shares His Love with all of my brothers and sisters who ask and every time that they ask. So, you, dear souls, in this circle are recipients of this Love as you remain open to the Love, the healing balm, the drink from God’s own soul that will enable you to stand tall and strong in the face of any condition.

These truths that you are given, might I suggest that you take them in deeply, that you pray about them, that you allow them to be in your souls and grow. They will contribute to your development. They will contribute to your soul, the steadfastness of your soul. Yes, we ask for this love again and again and with it comes many blessings, gifts, teachings, healings, faith, gratitude and truths. And those are the things which you hold onto when you are unsure of what the next step is, or when you are unsure about what you are observing. Sink deeply into your soul and bring forth those truths which will guide you. They do not change other than to be added to with other truths. They are a guardrail for you. Something to hold onto for you. Something for you to learn about and come to know as something more solid than rock upon the Earth.

God has many blessings for each of you. God has shown you the way, taking you by the hand and your part is to consider, contemplate, test all that is given to you so that you know what to do whenever you are perplexed. This is a gift that is available to all of God’s children.

I thank you for listening to me, this old philosopher but I say to you, trust in what is in your souls and open often and ask God for more blessings and more truth that will guide you. My love is with you, as is my Father’s. I am Josephus and I thank you for listening to me. God bless you. God bless you all.
