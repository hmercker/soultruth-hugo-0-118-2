# You Are a Soul with the Vehicle of Your Body and Mind

I am Mylora. The experiences that you are engaging in are helping you to go a little deeper within, into the essence of your soul. To experience your true nature, having the expression of the essence of your soul work harmoniously with your material mind through your body. It is important to value all that you are here on Earth, a soul with the vehicle of your body and your mind. For this is how your precious essence has the opportunity in this realm to express itself. So, as you put your intention with your discipline and your desire on inviting your essence forward throughout your day, as you engage in conversations as you are out in the world, this is what you are tasked with. For a soul that is awakening needs room, room in your life to inform your decisions and your thoughts.

You are all progressing in a beautiful way, but there is always more that can be done. There is always greater opportunity. So, practise this by allowing your soul to ascend and experience the nature of love, compassion and joy, of empathy to move through you. To let it fill your body. To let it fill your mental perceptions. For as you do this, you will notice within your material mind, there becomes a willingness for it to participate in such experience. Because once your material mind is given the opportunity to play along with the soul, you can notice an opening where your free will falls more harmoniously and in rhythm with your soul.

Remember, as your soul is created in the image of God, what is God? God is Love. God is kindness, compassion. God is patient. So, your soul will never push its way through. Just as God will never push His or Her way through into you. It requires an invitation, requires an opening, requires a longing. So, give yourself, give your mind the experience of engaging in life in such a way and you will observe a greater desire. Your free will becomes more harmonious. So, you are working it from both ends. You are asking your soul to awaken through Godâ€™s Essence and you are also disciplining your mind. This is how it needs to go until there is a more complete harmony within these two aspects of you, of communication.

It was a joy to observe how you fell into a deeper soul awareness, taking a conscious moment in exercise to perceive yourself as a soul and allowing your soul to inform through various sensations in the body, perceptions within the mind. This is a profound way of being. So, rather than living life from your head down into your soul, live your life from your soul up into your head, and watch yourself change in wondrous and beautiful ways as a channel of love.

I am Mylora. Always a blessing to be with you, God bless you.
