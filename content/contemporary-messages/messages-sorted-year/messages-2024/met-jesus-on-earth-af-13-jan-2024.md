# Met Jesus on Earth and Continues to Spread the Truth of God’s Love

Received by Al Fike 

I am Bartholomew, and I come from the Celestial Kingdom, far off from this place. Originally I came from Africa and my skin is black. I had the experience of an African living in the time of Jesus. I journeyed forth and met the Master while he was on Earth.

I come to continue with Jesus’ efforts and ministry to bring the Truth of God’s Love to the world. Here we are together, beautiful friends of truth, beautiful souls yearning for God. Here we come to open ourselves together. The power of this Circle of Light, sending each soul’s aspirations to God, combining this light and desire to bring the gift and blessings upon each one. 

The world is in great need of this. Many are lost. Many do not even know they are lost. God continues to work and make the efforts to connect, inspire, and love His children, all His children, all His children. He gathers this handful together in loving anticipation of blessings that will be given in great abundance. Around you are angels and many spirits who are curious, many spirits of light who have come to pray with you. Indeed, the intentions of mortals from around the world join with this modest effort. 

My beautiful friends of light, capture the Love of God within you. Open yourself to its inflowing, and you will become part of the great effort, movement and plan to heal humanity. For you will be healed in time. You will come to know the great blessings of God’s Love that will transform and make you into something new and beautiful and different from that which you can imagine at this time. 

The hidden faculties of the soul, the capacities of the soul, are ignited by this gift. In this, the change happens. In this, you become a different being, one that is closely aligned with the Divine, one that is in the light, one that God may use to bring greater light to your world. 

What more could you long for than this, to be released from all the conditions that are not of love, to be a channel of love, to be within the flow of God’s Will and Truth, to be reunited with God? All of these goodnesses, beautiful blessing, given freely and abundantly. You are here to receive. In your prayers together, open yourselves fully. Seek the gift, the great Love of God. God bless you, beloved souls. 

God bless you in His Love. God bless you in the Light of His Love. God bless you in the joy of His Love. God bless you in the peace of His Love. I am Bartholomew and I love you, beautiful souls of God. God bless you. God bless you all.
