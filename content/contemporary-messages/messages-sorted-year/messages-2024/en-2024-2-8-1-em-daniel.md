# Compliments on Working Together for a Healing

February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Daniel received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am Daniel. I come to compliment you as a community, as a unit, on how you come together to love and support your brothers and sisters. It is not always an easy task to commune harmoniously, but this opportunity that was given to you proved how strongly your brothers and sisters work together as a unit to heal, uplift and support one of its members.

This is how we should always, always respond. This is how we in the Celestial Heavens respond when our Father sends us, individually or together, to assist our brothers and sisters, whether they be in the spirit world or on the Earth plane. We are joyous at your response to this situation.

May the Father bless you, continue to hold you in His arms of Love and uplift you that you may be in greater harmony as you walk forward in your lives. I am your brother, Daniel. I will be with you also as you walk this path. May God bless you. My love is with you. The love of all of your brothers and sisters is with each one of you and will be forever. God bless you.
