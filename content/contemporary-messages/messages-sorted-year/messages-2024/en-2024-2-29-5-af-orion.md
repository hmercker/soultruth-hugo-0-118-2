# Speaks About Our Ministries, the Truth of the Father's Love and What's Ahead

The Truth of the Father’s Love must be shared, my beloved and beautiful friends. I am Orion. I come to speak to you about your ministries, about your efforts and about the future. For there is much work to do and you have been told this many times. There are many hungering souls who seek to know truth. Yet you find, with the barriers of the material world in which you live, it is difficult to penetrate the consciousness of those who are seeking, those who are wondering about who they are, their true selves and the true meaning of life.

When you use words such as “soul”, “God” and “love” even with these words a barrier comes up with many, for their minds have learned to reject these things as religious and irrelevant. You are challenged indeed, for your language is the language of soul, love and God. These things are of truth. It is difficult to bridge that gap of understanding using words. Yet, many feel the emanations of love, the light that you carry, the love that is flowing through you to them. They experience, on one level, the blessings that are flowing, yet, within their consciousness, their mindful ways, there is often conflict and rejection.

Your dilemmas are great. They exist not only for you, but for us. So, when we have open and willing individuals, beautiful souls who are receptive to the truth that is shared and given, the blessings that come from God so readily, then we surround these beautiful souls with love and light. We do so for you, beloveds. We are with you, day and night. Whether you are awake or asleep, whether you are praying, walking or doing your chores, we are with you, always. For it is the way of your world to put out the light. The forces of your world often conspire to do so. Whether that is forces of spirit or forces of mortals, together, it is a formidable force that is determined to sustain darkness.

You are challenged in this way as well. Even as you breathe and live in the world as a light, you are a confrontation to the darkness. If you are not vigilant, prayerful and careful, you will have experiences that can be an expression of this dark force. You must be vigilant in your prayers and not take for granted what has been given, which is a tremendous amount of love, light, blessings, healing and protection. God will envelop you in Love and Light. We will reflect the Will of God in doing so as well. Bright spirits, many aspects and elements of God’s universe that are in harmony with His Love and Truth, are yours to experience and be blessed by.

Yet free will is important. You must realise what your motivations are and how you might move in the world as a channel of God’s Love and Light. The more you are developed in your soul, receiving the great gift of God’s Love, with faculties awakening, your abilities to perceive being honed and developed, it becomes easier for you to discern between the elements of light and darkness. For often that middle ground is hard to discern and understand. Often, you enter these conditions unwittingly. It is important that you seek to be in the light always, to do so consciously, perceptively and with deep desire, so the outcomes of your efforts may always bring light to you.

Not only this, but all of us bring light through you to others. Each of you live a very different life, a different environment and different individuals that you encounter. But this too is a gift, for as you move in the world and are a light in the world, then others are drawn to you. Whether they realise it consciously or not, their souls are drawn to your soul. God is using you in many ways that you are often not aware of. Your perceptions do not take in the details and the subtleties of this, but that is not of any great concern. Rather, it is in your efforts to maintain the light within and around you.

This is a great responsibility and requires a great deal of effort and choice, for it is easy to fall into the human condition. Even using the language and paradigms of thought of the human condition, these things often bring with them the influence of that which is not of love. Not that you are consciously aware or continuing to draw this in, but it is habit, a state of mind and the state of the world, many elements conspiring to bring you to that place of greyness. Not darkness, per se, but a greyness, an undefined area that blends both conditions. Indeed, when you feel uplifted and you feel expansiveness of love and light and you feel an angel with you, then that swing of the pendulum is what you desire, and you enjoy. Yet often the pendulum swings toward the middle and then toward the darkness, doing so because the ways of your world and the ways of your mental habits continue to sustain and nurture these things.

Fear, beloveds, fear is often the catalyst for this. Do not allow yourself to fear. Be safe in the embrace of God and know that God will protect you always. Judgement will also propel you towards darkness, for judgement is a dark condition. You know well other conditions of hatred, envy, many things of the human condition that bring darkness. Yet, these things are often entertained amongst all of those around you. They think nothing of it, but they are enmeshed within this condition. You must choose otherwise beloved souls. You must choose with every breath, every thought, every word spoken, that they may be of light and express light.

It is important that you nurture this within yourself, within your consciousness, for this is a great challenge that every soul upon this planet has. For the common condition is that of greyness and darkness, not of light. There is light indeed, patches, bits, and pieces, people that are indeed of light walking the world. Yet, generally, they are far and few between, though the Law of Attraction will often draw you to them and them to you. This is part of God’s plan to bring the great souls of light together.

How will you communicate with another who has a different perspective mentally, but has a soul that resonates with you? This too is your challenge. There are many challenges. Each day presents them. Yet we continue to uplift, to teach, to inspire and to love. This is our blessing. The gift that God has given us to be with you, to help you and to nurture you, and we shall, forevermore. For this is the expression of our love, the love within our soul, continuing to be expressed in many ways, through many avenues and opportunities of service. We continue to give as we can, to be a light as we may, to show you the way, to nurture you. For you are children in need of education, upliftment and love, and so we do. We do so with every opportunity given and every possibility entertained. We are there and shall be forevermore.

May you be blessed, my beautiful friends. I am Orion and I love you. Each of you, I love you dearly. Precious souls. Pearls beyond price. Precious souls. The lights in the world. How blessed you are and how God loves you. Beautiful, beautiful, precious children. God bless you. I love you. God bless you.
