Love must be pervasive in every part of your life, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. You see the road before you and you wonder how you may traverse this road, what you must do in order to keep on the road, how you must be in order to be in harmony with the Will of God. Yet, as you move forward, listening to your soul, feeling your way along, there should be no conflict or disharmony, merely a sense of direction and joy in that direction, a sense, a purpose, and joy in that purpose, a sense of service and joy in that service. 

For as you walk along the Path Divine and continue to be God’s instruments as you go, many opportunities and possibilities are entertained upon that journey. It does not mean that you must obey to the letter the Will of God and the guidance of your angel friends. For you are in control of your life and you have the possibility of making decisions as you go. When it comes to planning, it is good that you entertain various thoughts and approaches. For as you do so, the true approach will be refined down to something that is both in harmony with you and in harmony with God. There will be a sense of this as you and God co-create together the future. Each has their perspective and their approach. 

Indeed, at times one of you may be dominant in that approach because the sense of it, the feel for it is great and the harmony that ensues from that feeling, from that approach is in alignment with God. Indeed, if it is in alignment with God, then all the rest will follow. No matter the numbers, whether it be merely the four of you or for a hundred of you, if there is one leader, which may be the leader for the moment, then that is the individual that each must follow, given a sense that this is right. Conflict comes when the mind entertains resistance to the way and the approach that is offered. Your desire is to indeed be in harmony with all that ensues, to be in harmony with the laws of love, the truth of love and to be God’s instruments, whether that be in supporting one another or supporting many others who are new to this path who are seeking, who desire to move forward in spiritual light. No matter what you do on a particular day in a particular moment, seek to be in harmony with the Will of God. Seek to be in harmony with yourself. Seek to be in harmony with those you are with. In this way, you generate light and you bring about God’s Will through the harmony, through the desire to serve, through the approach that you have gleaned from your soul. In this way, you will move forward swiftly, you will move forward harmoniously and you will move forward powerfully.

It is a way, an approach, an attitude, a state of mind and soul that must be honed and practised and delivered, however imprecise at the beginning it may be. In time, the precision will be greater and the effort will be more focused and clear as the flow of love is more powerful. It is for you, beloved souls, to step forward in whatever venture you are taking, whatever idea you may have, whatever approach you may assert. In this way, you will feel either the harmony of it or the discord of it. This way you learn and before you enter too far into that approach, into that effort, you might turn around and reconsider and discover once again the Will of God, and to express that Will through your efforts.

Yes, there is much to consider. There are many pitfalls and conditions on the earthly plane that may detract you. But as you grow in the Father’s Love, as your soul awakens more fully in this Love, then the discernment, the perception, the understanding grows with the Love. Therefore, clarity comes and the right approach comes with ease rather than great debate or mindful considerations. It merely comes as a flow that, in your mind, becomes obvious. In your soul it brings joy. So, you will continue to grow in discernment, in wisdom, and find your way upon the path that God has designated for you. Walk along this beautiful path with joy in your heart and a sense of rightness that, indeed, you are exploring and expressing your purpose in life. In this, comes the greatest joy that you are indeed in harmony with the Will of God, in harmony with your own gifts, with your own soul and in harmony with the laws of love. 

All these things are a test and a challenge. Yet, you have your angel friends close to help you to see, to discern and to understand. We will continue to be close, beloved souls. We will continue to help you find the way that is most harmonious. In your ventures, you will find harmony and you will find the open door that you seek and desire in order to move forward. Indeed, there are many doors, but you will find the right door. You will find the right approach. You will find that which is in harmony with the Will of God and that which is in harmony with light, purpose and will, coming together upon a grand journey that will be fascinating, surprising, powerful and filled with love.

God bless you, my beloved friends, students of the truth. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come once again to advise and to show you how it is that you may approach any given situation, desire and effort, to bring it into harmony with God and to bring the Will of God through it so that it may truly be an expression of light and love. God bless you, beloved souls. Augustine loves you and will be by your side, as will many. God bless you. God bless you. 

**Jesus speaks**

I come, my beloveds. Your brother and friend, Jesus, is with you. I come to continue to bless your journey and your efforts. I am with you, beloveds. I shall remain with you as you continue to reach out to others, helping God to open the door to their souls. We, who are with you, work diligently with each individual who comes to pray with you in your Circles of Light. I am with you, beloveds. I am with you in love. I am with you because I approve of your efforts and your journey together. I am with you because I love you. 

God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. May the peace that passes all understanding be with you and that you may be strong and of good health, cheerful, bright and loving, a blessing of peace. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you.
