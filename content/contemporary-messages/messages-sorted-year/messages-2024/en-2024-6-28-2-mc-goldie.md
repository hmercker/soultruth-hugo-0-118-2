You’re all learning so very much about yourselves, the angels, and the aspects of your entire being as one who lives on Earth. You are discovering your journey with God, allowing God’s Essence to inflow and awaken all parts. Be sure to enjoy your journey and bring joy to it. It is not something that you will pass or fail at. But you will progress. Trust that with every drop of God’s love that comes into your soul, you will progress. Be lit by the fire of this love within your soul and bring balance, harmony and alignment into your awareness. Release your judgements and replace them with acceptance and love and be in the grace of God.

Joy is key but remember that long-lasting joy comes from the depths of your soul. Allow joy to embody your experience from an inward and grounded way. The joy of the soul is a profound experience that rests deeply within you. All your attributes and their expression are from the depths within. This is the soul's expression, and as your barriers and encrustations transform, it opens the doorway of the soul, and soon enough, beloved friends, this doorway will remain open. At times, you close this doorway to protect yourself. Keep your door open, for God’s love is ever flowing to your soul with great joy. I am Goldie. God bless you.
