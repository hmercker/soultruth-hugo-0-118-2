# Pentecost Prayer and Blessing

May 19<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Creator of all, I beseech you to touch deeply each and every soul that is here. All the yearning souls of the world with the flames of Your Love. That those flames may penetrate to the soul and burn away all the impurities and in its place the rising of a new soul. The birth that comes with a benediction of Your Love. This, I ask, in all earnestness and prayer for my brethren who seek this gift so earnestly and devoutly.

I come to you, my beloveds, your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you. I ask you to open your souls. Open bear that part of you so tender and vulnerable. That part of you that wonders and is the true creation and reflection of God. In this tenderness, in this open heart lies the key to the blessing of the Pentecost. The yearning of your soul desiring the touch of God.

This simple but profound truth must be for this moment, everything. Your focus. Your desire. Your yearning brought together in a powerful message to God, saying *“I am here. I am here to be with You. I wish to know You. I wish to know the power of Your Love within me, that power building, transforming me into all that which I am meant to be. All the blessings and potentials of my soul to be realised by Your Love, the blessing that comes with the Pentecost. I am your child and so I come to my Heavenly Father. I come, for I know I am weak, that I am a part of this human condition that continues to draw me away from You. Help me to see beyond this. Help me to live beyond this to that place of pure faith and powerful knowing that is truly Your blessing upon me.”*

My beloved brethren, at the time of the Pentecost, were indeed lost and were desperate. They carried shame, grief and all manner of human feelings and conditions. With my second coming with them, they were aware. I helped them to understand the impediments to their soul. I helped them to see beyond their humaneness, to that place deep within. Once that mission had been fulfilled, once I proclaimed myself and gave them the proof that was needed, that they may understand that my message was real and true, then I ascended into the Celestial Heavens and allowed them their time to consider, to pray, to come together. So they did. So they did. God in His Great Mercy and Love for my brothers and sisters, gave to them the ultimate gift, the ultimate declaration. That of the Pentecost that sealed their fate, that allowed them to move forward and to continue the ministry that I started and for them to fulfill their destinies as per God's plan.

Without this great empowerment from God, would the apostles and others walk the route of service and truth in the world? It would have been unlikely. For before the Pentecost they were weak and desperate. After this great gift, they came to know their true selves and their true destinies. God called them at that moment. God beseeched them to walk the path of service bringing the truth of love to their brothers and sisters, just as I did. Just as my example helped to teach them the way and the means by which they may be God's instruments. So they were touched deeply. Their minds could  not refute what they had experienced. They could not turn back, but walk forward. Still, this ministry that began so long ago, continues today within each one of you, beloveds.

Will you step forward or will you turn back? Though the conditions and situation
provided the ways and means for God to bless my brethren so deeply, you, My beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, are blessed each and every day. You put yourself forth in prayer and you ask to be of service, to be God's instruments. You seek the great benediction of His Love. The power of love, that small Pentecost happens and is given each and every day. Can you not deny this? It is the truth. The power of this truth is capable of transforming your world as it is capable of transforming you. It is what is meant for every child. Every soul upon this world and the next has the opportunity to receive. I ask you, my beloved and beautiful friends, to be the harbingers of truth. To carry that torch of truth into the world. The world is a dark place and it is in need of the light.

Will you be the light, beloveds? Will you put aside your reticence, your confusions, your doubts? Will you put aside your shame, your judgments, your fears? Will you step forward in the pure light of truth so that you may be called upon by God to speak, to demonstrate the truth? You are able to travel to many places in the world. My travels were minuscule compared to what you are capable of, beloveds. You may reach many souls. You may come upon many situations and opportunities that God will place before you. It is for you, beloveds, to say *“yes, I am willing. Yes, I want to be Your instrument. I want to follow the path that Jesus showed the way. I want to be that disciple of his glorious ministry and example.”*

Each soul will express this in their own unique way, with their own unique gifts. I do not ask for you to be me. For I was one and only one. I ask for you to be yourself. That deep and abiding self that lies within you and is of great light, of wisdom. That carries a great truth. A universal truth that shall last for eternity. Let your light shine, beloveds. Let your light shine. Seek the nurturance from God that shall brighten and intensify that light.

I am your brother and friend Jesus and I come to affirm to you, the truth of the Pentecost is the truth that you carry within your soul. It shall be given in accordance to your desire. It shall express itself through you in accordance to your will and compliance with the Will of God. Together, you will be that instrument. Guided. Protected. Blessed and awakened in the glory of His truth. In the flames of the Pentecost and the power of love manifest. I am with you. I am with you as I was with my disciples at that moment of Pentecost. I am with you now and pray for this blessing for each one of you. I love you. I love each one of you. I am truly your friend and brother. God Bless you. I am Jesus and I love you.
