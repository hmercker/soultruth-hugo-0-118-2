# May God’s Universal Love Infill Every Soul

Indeed, may this Universal Love, the love that comes from the Great Soul, the One who has created us all, infill your soul, awaken your soul. Indeed, humanity is a very diverse group filled with many inclinations, ideas and motivations. So many diverse cultures, so many diverse religions, so many diverse ways of government and yet the creative impulse within humanity continues to manifest in all of these different directions. Could you imagine if you could harmonise these impulses, if there was deep respect and peace amongst men, how the world would change, how your world would be a different place? But instead, each individual competes with others. Not seeking to love, accept and embrace, but seeking to be above and on top of another so that they are recognised, so that they are seen. 

My beloved friends, God sees every soul. God recognises every soul. Those who have a soul that is awakened in love can see as well and appreciate the uniqueness of God’s creation in every soul. It is important that you see the world in this way. Not in the way that is so common and I have described, but in a way that embraces and brings a possibility of oneness. Even though each is unique, the power of love can bring everyone together in harmony, in grace, in joy, in appreciation. What will do that? What will bring humanity together? Is it not this great gift of love that you aspire to? Is it not the blessings of God upon you that brings its peace and acquiesces the inclinations and desire for power and for control? Does it not fulfil the need of each individual soul to be loved? 

So much humanity needs to learn about what is truly in the universe, what is truly available to each one. If you can demonstrate this in a powerful way, in a beautiful way, in a light-filled and truth-filled way, then you are leading humanity toward the goal that is, indeed, put before humanity to be in that harmonious condition of love and to harness all the gifts and abilities, not toward the benefit of one, but the benefit of all. What a wonderful world that would be. What a wonderful world that is needed to be. For how humanity expresses itself is often destructive rather than creative and harmonious. You must learn the ways of creativity, harmony and love. That way, all of humanity will know the joy of living, the love that is inherent in living, the light that can be expressed in living harmoniously. 

Pray for this, my friends. We continue to be with you in prayer and in action to help humanity see the light, see the truth and act in accordance with these things. There is a long way to go. But indeed, the efforts, blessings and light quicken as God pours His Love upon you all and seeks to lift you up and to redeem you in love. May you be blessed my friends. Seek the gift. Seek to be in harmony. Seek to love your brothers and sisters and you will be a light, an example of the truth. I am Orion and I love you all. Blessings to you, my friends. Blessings to the world. God bless you in love.
