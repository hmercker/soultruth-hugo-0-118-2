# God’s Love is Your Birthright

February 9<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Online Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Joan. I come.

I see this great Love that is expressed in this room among all of you. You can feel it. You can perceive it. Take this in deeply. Carry it with you. Continue to seek this Love that God has put within you and within the souls in this room. This is the Father's Will that you seek Love, God's Love, which will join you, strengthen you, uphold you and bless you. You are cherished, each of you, by the Creator, the greatest source of Love. You are cherished.

May the Father's Love rain down upon your open souls. May you be joyous in this Love. May you open wider, grow greater in this Love. It is your birthright and it is God's Will. May God bless you all. I love you. I am Joan of Arc, sister to you all.
