# The Highest form of Prayer

September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

May the love of God be upon you and fill your souls. I am your celestial sister, Clare. How often we request you to go to God in prayer, and yet, sometimes, depending on the quality of your intention, this request becomes diluted or misconstrued. 

With my sisters, of course we prayed constantly; many types of prayers; prayers of thanksgiving, prayers asking for a blessing, prayers for our enemies, prayers of supplication for those things we felt we needed in the material world, prayers asking for forgiveness, prayers of praise. But I tell you the highest form of prayer is the one that comes from the deep longing of every soul to be at one with God, whether spoken or simply intended. 
  
It is when you are in the will of God, the presence, the holy Presence, that you can bless your enemies and pray for them and be able to turn the other cheek. It is when you are in grace, you can let go of resentment and long held issues left unresolved, that have kept your heart from completely opening in your prayer. 
   
There is a saying that I assume most of you are very aware of used in groups of people who have addictions, which is *‘let go and let God’*. As you let go, and you ask God to open up your soul, you let God fill your soul with His essence and in the small whispers, you begin to perceive with your soul, in the will of God in alignment with your own will, the flow of grace where guidance comes in tandem with the angels. If it is material things you require, there are many progressive, wonderful, blessed spirits who are given charge. 

For a soul that is hungry, goes directly to God but a body that is hungry asks for sustenance and when it is given in response, that one whether with words or just with a grateful heart, offers a prayer of thanksgiving. If when you awake each morning, you awaken in gratitude, in gratitude to God for your soul, for His love, for every good and perfect gift, it will help you to maintain a connection and to feel the holy presence in the love of God, which is the great gift. 
  
So, as the Master said, love God with your whole heart and your whole soul and your neighbor as yourself, in the love of God. I shall step back, and I thank you, each one of you a beautiful soul, so beloved by God. Be kind to each other. Help each other and pray. 
   
With all my love and the blessings from above. I am Clare, once of Assisi, now an inhabitant, a redeemed soul in the celestial heavens, and your sister, always. God bless you.
