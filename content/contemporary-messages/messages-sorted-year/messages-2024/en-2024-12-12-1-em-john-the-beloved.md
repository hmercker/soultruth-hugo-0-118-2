# Love Is the Measure of Service to God

December 12<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Rock Hill, SC, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John the Beloved and I join you in your prayers today to uplift you, to bring you a greater understanding of your desires to serve our Father. These desires are met everyday in every moment as God provides opportunities for you to serve through your diligence with prayer, through your willingness to make choices that are in harmony. This serves God because it uplifts the energy upon the Earth. Your choices that are in harmony are of value to the healing of the Earth. Your choice to pray, moment to moment, is of course another way in which you serve God’s will. The blessings that you receive include many, many, many opportunities to love, to bring forward those gifts within your souls, both implanted at creation. And as you pray, that too, serves God’s will. So you see there are many, many ways in which you serve God’s will if you so choose.

You are blessed. You are blessed with the mightiest gift of all which is the Divine Love. Express this love and that too uplifts the energies upon this planet. You see how simple it is to serve God? Love is the measure of service to God. May God bless you. May you be willing, moment to moment, to serve God in a myriad of ways that are available to you. God bless you all. You are precious, precious, precious souls and we, in the Celestial Heavens, acknowledge you as such. May God bless you. I am John the Beloved, your brother. The Master comes to bless you all. Be Open.
