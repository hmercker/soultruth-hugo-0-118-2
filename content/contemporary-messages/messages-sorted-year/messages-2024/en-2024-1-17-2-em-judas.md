Judas received by Elizabeth Mack

You asked and here I am. I have never left. We are always with you, children. God shines His light upon you and raises you and I say to you, you never have to question. If you hear it, if you feel it, know that it comes from God as a blessing. Yes, I am Judas. I too have learned many lessons, most of which is to trust implicitly our Father in heaven. Put aside those questions, those doubts. Put aside those misunderstandings. Bring forth that love inside of you and aim it to the Father and be in that condition, that condition of communion. You will never go wrong. You will never make a mistake. You will never deviate from your path. You will never sin, make an error of judgement. I swear to you. The Father will hold your hand if you give it to Him. He will bring you straight to Him.

You will never, ever need to question. This is the kind of faith that brings you close. This is the kind of trust that you build with the Creator of everything. Your desires in your souls are beautiful. Be in your souls and then go to the Father and submit your will to God’s will. Let Him overshadow your will and bring you to the fulfillment that you truly desire. For where else would you find such love? Where else would you find such grace, such power to move everything out of the way and to bring your very sweet soul home to Him?

Never doubt. Never doubt. It is what begins a fall. Never doubt. I am your brother and the brother of my beloved Master, Jesus, whom I love for all eternity and our Father and our Father. I love you, dear children, for the work that you do, for the souls that you are, for the path that you walk, and I am here whenever you ask me to be here. I am your brother in the light of Christ love. I am Judas, follower of my Master, child of my Father, devoted, devoted to my Father’s will and plan for this world and your souls. God bless you. God grant you peace. God grant you mercy. God give you all the blessings that you need every step of the way. My love is with you. I will be here as you need me.
