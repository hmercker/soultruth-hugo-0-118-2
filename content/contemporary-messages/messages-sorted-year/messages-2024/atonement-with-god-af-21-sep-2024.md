# Atonement With God

September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Poughkeepsie, N.Y. U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike 

May the great gift of God’s Love be with you, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to affirm the truth with you. To assure you that, as you seek for the highest gift that God can give, His Essence, His Love, then you are on the road that shall lead to the Celestial Kingdom and at-onement with God. 

This is the greatest and deepest fulfilment of the soul’s longing, for the soul was once with God and now the soul wishes to return to God. But the soul shall return to God different, for it has had the experience of life in the flesh and life in the spirit. Thus, it is a changed and unique individual that now has a greater awareness, a greater potential to know God and to be in its uniqueness for eternity, forever expressing and developing the gifts that God has given to it. Thus, the soul will find its way through a myriad of experiences and development to be that realised and beautiful soul transformed by love that is meant upon this journey.

I lead the way, beloveds, and I too continue to grow. I too continue to know God in a deeper way. With each prayer, with each time that I focus my attentions upon this relationship between myself and my Creator. I tell you there is nothing more magnificent, more fulfilling, more wondrous than this relationship. The joy that I feel in knowing my Heavenly Father, is a joy that I cannot describe. It is a joy that you could not understand at this time. Yet, you feel inklings of that joy. You are coming to know, to a measure, the relationship you have with your Creator. As you continue to know your own soul, to develop the awareness of soul and to have within you the balance between the conscious mind and the mind of the soul, you will find that you will get closer to God. You will come to know God in ways that are foreign to you now. You will come to know the deep peace that comes with this relationship, this connection with your Creator. You will come to know how wondrously, how beautifully, how deeply you are loved by God. 

All of these things must be your motivation, beloved souls. Your motivation in prayer. When you are not in prayer, your motivation is to reach out to others in love. For when you experience this great gift and all the benefits that come with it, do you not want to share with your brothers and sisters the glory and wonderment that is a life with God, a life fulfilled by God’s Touch, a soul awakened by God’s Love? We are all His children and in God’s eyes, we are loved equally. But some of us know God’s Love in a greater measure than others and those of you who do must share this love, express this love and live this love. For in this way, you affirm the gift and you ensure that the gift continues to be given, pouring into your soul as you open yourself as a channel of love in the world, a light, a light bright and beautiful, a light that affirms your true self, affirms the journey that you are on, affirms the way and the means by which you may know God.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, with a mighty inflowing of His Love, that your souls may find its place within you, that you no longer have problems and difficulties understanding, realising and consciously awakening to your soul, so that your soul becomes the predominant part of you, your consciousness realised as the soul grows in love, expands and is transformed as the gifts of the soul awaken and become palpable and real in your life. With these gifts, you will navigate this dark place with light, wisdom, joy and love. As such, you will be a powerful instrument to teach, to heal, to give in love to your brothers and sisters. 

I come to you to affirm this truth, for I too walked the Earth and I too had my struggles  not like yours. Yet still, there were those who would reject me. Many rejected me. But there were the precious few that followed me and with that gathering of souls, we gained a momentum in light and many more came to entreat us with their intentions and attention, to listen and to learn. This too will be your fate, beloved souls, as you continue to grow in the Father’s Love and release all the impediments that hold you from it. You will grow and strengthen in light and wisdom. You will bring joy, light, truth and love to many.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom. I carry the light of truth and I share this light with you, beloveds. I shall for eternity be your brother and friend. I shall walk with you forever. We shall discover the glories of God’s creation, God’s universe and God’s Soul together. Together, we will share this wondrous journey and be in the grace of love. God bless you, beloveds. I love you and shall always love you, never to fail in this love. Always, always given and shall grow as we all grow in the Light of God’s Love. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
