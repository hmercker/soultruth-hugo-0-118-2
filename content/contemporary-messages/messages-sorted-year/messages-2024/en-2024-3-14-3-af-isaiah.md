# Bask in the Glory of God

March 14<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Queensland, Australia

Isaiah received by Al Fike

I am Isaiah and I come to pray with you and be with you in the Light of God’s presence. How often do you seek out God’s presence? How often are your souls basking in the gift of His presence? It is important that you continue to seek out the presence of God, to bask in the peace that passes all understanding, to feel the warmth of His Love upon you, to absorb that gift that is His Love within your souls.

For what do you seek, my friends, what do you seek? Is it the gratification of your mind, the manifestation of all things spiritual, or is it the gentle upliftment of your soul in the Love of God? For if you seek this, you have come to the right place. For our intention is that you know this place, this feeling, this consciousness which is the communing of your soul with God’s Soul. It is the awakening of your soul in the Light of God’s Touch. It is all that is of the soul realised and expressed in your conscious self, in your life. It comes as you seek out this gift of Love. It comes because you are sincere in seeking. It comes because God’s plan and God’s Will ensures that you will receive this gift, provided you seek it in all earnestness and desire.

There are many ways one can travel when seeking spiritual succour. But there is only one, as brother Jesus has called it, the straight and narrow path. There is only one that leads to at-onement with God, that leads to the eternal expansion of soul that comes with this communion and with these efforts to be with God. So, we come to encourage you upon this path, this way. It is not complicated. It does not restrict. It is not so narrow that you cannot walk through. Rather, as you walk through, you know the sweet Embrace of God, the beautiful Touch of His Holy Spirit upon your soul, the wonderment of your consciousness expanding into the consciousness of God. These things are of the highest blessing, of the most powerful Touch. As your souls grow and seek out the truth, so all that is spiritual, all that is truly of you that God has created, will thrive and awaken in His Love.

Do not resist the inflowing, the journey of awakening that place of knowing and feeling that is the soul. Rather, acknowledge that you are a child of God. Acknowledge the Embrace of God. Acknowledge the power of His Touch upon you and you will find yourself uplifted in great light, great beauty, joy and love. There is no greater fulfilment than this. There is no more beautiful experience than this. For all comes in this highest of blessings and all is realised in the progression of the soul brought about by this blessing.

My beloved and beautiful friends, we are in God’s presence at this time. Seek for it. Long for it. Open yourself to it. Put aside all thoughts of the material. Put aside all that might restrict you and walk the narrow path to oneness with God. God bless you. I am Isaiah, and I love you. God bless you.
