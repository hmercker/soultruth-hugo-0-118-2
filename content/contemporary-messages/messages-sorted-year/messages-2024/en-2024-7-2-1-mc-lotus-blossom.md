# Transform the Way You Perceive the World

July 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

It has been my great pleasure to be with you while you have been in sleep state to assist your bodies in adjusting to the chemical blending that has occurred, to assist you to rest well to feel replenished and rejuvenated. Indeed, there has been much change within each one. My words of encouragement to leave you with some inspiration: As you look upon the world, look through the eyes of your souls. Look beyond the physical. See the light that resides within your brothers and sisters. Speak from that light within you. Transform the way you perceive the world. If you can do this, you will experience the openness, the authenticity of the love that exists within your soul, the expression of this to not constrict, restrict or obstruct the flow that it wishes to spread its love. It wishes to enact the substance of the Creator that exists within you. Experience this, beloveds. Begin to see the world. Speak to the world and be an example of the love that you are. Allow your beautiful mind to merge into the ocean of love that lives within you and that you truly are. May each one carry their light forward brightly to rise and shine. I am Lotus Blossom. God bless you.
