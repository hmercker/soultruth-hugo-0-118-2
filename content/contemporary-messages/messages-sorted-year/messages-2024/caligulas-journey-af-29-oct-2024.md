# Caligula Describes His Journey from the Deepest Hells to the Celestial Heavens

I am Caligula. I am sure you are surprised that I would come to speak to you considering my reputation, known even now, although that person that I was so many hundreds of years ago no longer exists. I am now in the Celestial Kingdom. I have struggled and clawed my way out of the darkness of the hells into these sublime conditions of heaven, the Celestial Heavens. I was indeed helped by many to make that transition and I had many hundreds of years in order to do so. Yet I have been in the Celestial Heavens for many hundreds of years. Thanks to the beautiful soul that is Jesus, who was persecuted by those of my kind, I have found my redemption. I have found my way to the light. 

How grateful I am. For I would not wish the suffering and the conditions that I brought forth in the world, and the consequential inhabitation of the hells because of them, upon any individual. Even I, who was indeed a scorned and very dark soul, found redemption,  peace and fulfilment in the Truth of God's Love. If I am able to find my way to that beautiful and sacred hall of the Celestial Heavens, then any and every individual, whether they be on Earth, in the hells, in the spirit world, can find their way as well.

It takes intention, desire and application. I yearned for relief from the suffering that I encountered when I passed over into spirit. It took a very long time for that relief to come, for I had much to deal with, acknowledge and come to reconcile. I spent many long hours, tearfully moaning and feeling lost in the very dark conditions that I was in. You see, in these hells, there are few that can assist you. 

Yet there are those who are willing to enter into those dark places and reach out in loving kindness to another. Indeed it is meant that every soul will find their way out of the hells and walk in light. In time, they will inhabit either the heaven of the natural man or the Celestial Kingdom. It will come to all of us in time. Because of my journey, I am compelled to help others out of that dark and horrible place. Indeed there are those who are most willing to help others in this way.

I come to speak of the soul and its relationship with God. For in this relationship, this intimacy of the soul seeking out the blessings of the Creator, the infusion of His Love into the soul, the soul is like a womb. Within that womb, God inseminates Love. Within that commingling of energies and conditions, the soul becomes reborn and transformed into something new. So it is a new birth of the soul. When the soul is vulnerable, seeks out its Creator and wants the great gift of His Love, then it is given. It is received by the soul as a natural blessing that is given freely and the potency of it is indeed miraculous and life-giving to the soul. 

In this regard, the soul has no gender, for this gift is given to male or female. There is no difference. Each gender does not change the nature and the power of this blessing given. Each of you, male or female, has the opportunity to receive the great gift of God's Love, to receive it willingly, to be transformed by it and to have it infill your soul to such a degree that you will be changed irrevocably and beautifully.

You will be transformed by love, for God loves all His children. God gives this blessing to each and every child, no matter their sexual identity, no matter their predilections. It comes freely and without judgement. This Love comes universally and it is a gift given to everyone, no matter their history, no matter how they relate to the world, no matter their religion, politics, way of life or culture. These things matter not when it comes to you and your soul's relationship with your Creator, for the mind does not hamper the inflowing of this great gift. Rather it is the soul and the mind of the soul that opens the door through yearning, longing and desire. So it is that even a soul like myself, who had done great wrong in the world and to many people, can now know the redemption of love, the blessing of God's Love infilling me, transforming me to the state where I might enter into the Celestial Kingdom.

This is a miracle. This indicates the power, the depth and the breadth of God's Love for every soul created, every soul that inhabits the pre-existence, every soul that has been incarnated, every soul that has entered into the spirit world and every soul that inhabits the Celestial Kingdom. That Love is equally great, equally formidable and potent and able to change the very nature of that individual into something closer to the Divine. 

Can you comprehend the immensity of this fact? Those of you here today and those of you who may listen to this message have not lived a life that is evil and dark. Yet there are many out there in the world and in the dark planes of spirit who have indeed chosen a dark path. I urge you to have compassion for these individuals, to be true to your soul's desire to love all, to have compassion for all and to reach out and assist all who are suffering. Without these measures and efforts from you and from others of light, how would a dark soul like I was, or the dark souls that continue to inhabit the hells, find their way beyond these conditions?

Indeed God is ever there to reach forth to these individuals. But to be receptive, to be open, even to feel worthy, it often takes another's support, love and encouragement for them to truly believe, to have an inkling, to have some small desire to reach for the light. There is much darkness in your world, in the worlds below you and in some of the worlds above you. There is much work to do to help clear out these conditions, the darkness in these worlds and in your world. I urge you to continue to be dedicated, to seek out the possibilities of service, to be clear and dedicated in your understanding of the truth and to be loving channels for God. 

We all work together and I hope that you can see me in a different light than history has put upon me. I am no longer that dark and evil individual. I have gone through all the cleansing, pain and reconciliation that I had to go through in order to come to this place of light. Indeed without the great gift of God's Love spurring me on, transforming and healing me, it would have taken far longer for me to even be in somewhat a condition of light. The power of love to heal is immense. The power of love to transform is a miracle. May you all feel, know and experience it for what it truly is and as you do so, may you show the way to others.

My name is Caligula. I was once an emperor of Rome, a fallen soul, deprived and evil. Now I am a Celestial angel. I thank you for the privilege and honour of speaking to you today and telling you some of my story. Although there is much more to tell, I will use this time to encourage, to uphold and to assure you that there are many angels who are here to uplift you and to bring the glory of God's Light and Love closer to you and you closer to it. God bless you. My love is with you, my friends, and I hope you may consider me your friend. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.
