# Focus on God and Put All Distractions Aside

It is good to be with you. I am White Feather. There is much for all of you to learn about the ways of God and the ways of this universe of God’s creation. Do not waste your time in idle pursuits, but be in alignment with God. In this way, whatever God wants to give to you, whatever wisdom and truth is available to you, it will be given freely and abundantly. There is nothing that will hold you from this other than your own lack of focus and desire. Are you interested in knowing these things, my brothers and sisters? Or do you prefer to be distracted by the material and human conditions that bring you away from God? 

You are on a mission to help others, to show them the way beyond these conditions. So I urge you to be focused in your own way, in your own heart, in your own soul and in your prayers to be with God. This pursuit is often a quiet one. Not one filled with words, but one filled with longing and prayer, in the silence of your soul speaking to God’s Soul and God’s Soul speaking to your soul. In this silence the truth is revealed. In this longing, the Love of God flows freely and abundantly. In this comes great peace and great light. 

Seek for the highest. Do not allow the distractions in the material world, the distractions even of your failing bodies to hold you from God. For in that place where you and God are communing together, the material matters not. Any form of material matters not. It is truly the feelings, expressions, and perceptions of the soul that are your gift for the moment, your blessing from God. Your reception to it is determined by how deep you can go into your souls, how clear you are in that place so that it is unmuddied by the waters of material thought and conditions. Rather, the purity, the beauty of the soul awakening to God, feeling the blessings, the flow of God’s Essence into you, this is the place of transformation, of wisdom, of truth. This is where you must go and be, in that place that is touched by the Divine. 

I am White Feather and I pray with you today. I am with you often. May the blessings of God continue to awaken you, to go deep within and stir the true perceptions and experiences that are eternal in that eternal part of you. Blessings to you, my friends. May the Touch of the Great White Spirit be yours for eternity. My love is with you. God bless you.
