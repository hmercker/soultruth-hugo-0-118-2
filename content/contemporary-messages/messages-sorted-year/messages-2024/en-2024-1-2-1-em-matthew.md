Matthew received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Matthew. I come with the Father’s Love in my soul to bless each and every one of you who are also His dear, dear children. You are special. You are unique. You are the foundation of the Truth upon this Earth. Never before has it been so strong as it is now, this foundation of Truth of God’s Divine Love. There are many souls upon this Earth who now receive this Love. There are many souls who open to receive this Love. Yet, their minds may not even know it. It is just a moment. It is just a thought of God that opens their souls to receive His gift once more.

You, my dear children, choose to take the time to open your souls to the Father’s Love and you do so frequently, gathered together with your brothers and sisters, both in the flesh and in the spirit. We, from the Celestial Heavens, come to join you as you pray, for we too benefit from prayers to God for this Love still and will do so eternally. We come to join you and uplift you, guide you and love you.

We are children of God, all of us. In our souls, we share God’s Essence of Love and we are connected by this Love. There is much to be joyful about. There is much love. There is much love here now. Dear children, true children of the Father, open your souls. Open them wide and allow this Love to flow deeply into your souls, touching parts of you that will awaken and be manifested. You have many gifts within you and this Love will awaken them. Open. Open wide and let this Love, the Father’s Love, which rains down upon us all now, enter your souls.

I am your brother, Matthew of the Bible. My love is with you. It is a deep love for each of you. May our Father bless you again and again and again.
