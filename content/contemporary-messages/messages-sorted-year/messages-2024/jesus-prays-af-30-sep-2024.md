My beloved Father, I beseech you to bless my brothers and sisters with a great outpouring of Your Love, to help sustain them in this world and help to bring them to You, that they may know their Your presence, Your Touch, Your Love. That they may be uplifted, healed and given great dispensation from the darkness of this world. I beseech You, dear God to bless these children in the Love of Your Essence and the power of Your Touch. 


May you know all that is, all that can be, all that shall be in this sacred Touch of Love. I am your brother. I walk with you. I am a part of you. I shall always be a part of you for we are of one family, a family of light, a family that is in alignment and harmony with God. Blessed are the children of light, that they shall inherit the Earth and bring it into love, into joy and harmony. We work for the betterment of humanity, for the betterment of this Earth, for the betterment of all that is of God and God’s universe.
So we shall walk upon the Earth as God’s instruments, channels of light and love. We will find our way upon the path that God has designated and find joy there, fulfilment of our hearts and souls, inspiration for our minds, truth in everything we do.

May you be blessed, beloved children of God and know that you are truly loved and shall walk in the light of God’s blessings, protection and guidance. God’s sacred Touch is upon us. Feel the inflowing of His Love. Open to it with yearning and desire. Find unity with God in His Touch. 

Blessings to you, my brethren. Blessings to all.
