# The Solutions to Your Problems Come with Faith

The things that you speak of are challenges of faith. These things that you feel are holding you back from God are the things that you have built within your minds, your attitudes and your life reflecting that which is not of faith, but that which is of will. When you look at your impediments, when you see beyond the complications of your life, you will find a solution in God, in your relationship with your Creator. That solution will come in faith, for it is in faith that you draw yourself to God. Open yourself to God and ask for the healing and blessings that come from the Creator. Do not hold yourselves back from finding, knowing and expressing these solutions that are in fact very mild and not so grandiose as to affect your life in ways that bring great pain and difficulty. Rather, to put aside the concerns and to live within your soul, in the joy of your soul, in the wisdom of your soul, in the strength that is love that is building within your soul. 

My beloved and beautiful students, what you express is common and part of the Earth plane. These difficulties continue to plague many. You have found the key, the solution that is, as you pray for the great gift of God’s Love, then that Love shall clear away all impediments, all that holds you back from truly being that instrument, that beautiful soul. Of having those gifts and expressing those gifts, of being a channel of love in the world. All of these things come from the one source and gift that is given, the gift from God that is given from His Soul to your soul. Often these impediments are fabrications of the mind, attitudes and perceptions that are part of the mind and part of the human condition. You have dedicated yourselves to moving beyond these things, of being and living within the grace of God. In that grace is harmony, peace and joy. 

Seek this out, beloved souls, and the solutions will come. The healing will come. The peace will come. It is given to you by God without restrictions, without limitations and without compromise. It is given freely and abundantly. You will find your way, beloved souls. I know that you live in an Earth plane that adds to these complications and causes great consternation. I too lived upon this plane at one time, but I did not have as you have now, the great armies of angels that surround you, the blessings from God that flow upon you, and the clarity of the truth that is given. It is for you to accept, to embrace and to truly be a part of this great and wondrous gift that is offered to you that shall indeed transform and change you and heal you from all impediments. It is a matter of faith, beloved souls. I urge you to walk in faith, to pray with faith, to see your life with the faith that gives you vision, optimism and desire for greater light, peace and truth.

My beloved and beautiful students, you are loved beyond measure and shall be blessed beyond measure. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I love you. I shall be by your side always. You shall have angels by your side at every moment of every day. In this, you will be uplifted. In this, given your faith and openness, you shall see the solutions to your problems, your feelings of inadequacy and all those conditions that are not a part of your soul growing in the Father’s Love. 

God bless you, beloveds, and keep you in His Love. May your faith grow. May your joy grow. May the expressions of your heart, your soul and your gifts multiply and express themselves with such bounteous beauty that you will never doubt yourself and you will always be God’s child, His instrument of love for the benefit of humanity. It comes to you in great measure. It comes to you by the Hand of God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you, beloved and beautiful souls, so earnestly seeking to be in God’s grace and to be truly themselves. It shall be so. I promise you, it shall be so. God bless you. God bless you.
