John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

Peace be with you. Peace be upon your souls, your hearts, your minds. I am John the Beloved and I come with a message from our Master who is Jesus and who is away at this moment with the intention of securing peace in some battlegrounds upon this Earth. For his power is great. He is the Prince of Peace, and he exudes this peace as well as compassion and love. So, he goes to those places that are in the greatest need for this peace at this time. It is the Father’s will that humankind turn away from those conditions which are unsettling to their souls and that they turn towards the Father and receive the blessings that are available to them to help them overcome those conditions within their souls.

So, I come in his stead to offer what you might call “condolences” to your sister and her family and yet we know that this is the beginning of a path that he shall walk for a long time. For he has much growing to do in this light that he now sees and recognizes in his wife. And he will grow in this love, for she has been a wonderful model for him expressing that love that is within her soul. And this is all that we ask of you upon the Earth, is to that you express that love that is within your souls. So that your brothers and sisters will feel it as they walk upon the Earth and they will see it, once they transition. These experiences will help them to grow in God’s Divine Love.

You see, it is very simple. It is what we ask of you is that you be who you are with this love within your souls, that your brothers and sisters may share in this gift, if not immediately, then once they pass over. It is simple because God made it so. Look around you and I do speak to those spirits in the spirit world as well. Look around you and see the light of your brothers and sisters, some of whom are upon the Earth and some of whom are in the spirit world and some very, very bright spirits. They come from a very high place that you, too, can attain. So I ask you when you leave this prayer circle that you go to those very, very bright spirits. For there are many who are here who can help you. And these humans, too, can help through prayer for you. How simple can this be, dear brothers and sisters upon the Earth, and you have all the protection that you need.

Continue in your prayers to the Father for his love. Continue to walk this path to grow in this love, to expand in your soul and one day we will greet you in the Celestial Heavens and I speak to all of you who are here. May God bless you. I am your brother, John. My love is with you. The Master’s love is with you and our Father’s love is with you. God bless you.
