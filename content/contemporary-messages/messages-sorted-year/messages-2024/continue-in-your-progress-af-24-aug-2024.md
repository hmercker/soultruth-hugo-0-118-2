Yes your world is a world of great challenges, my friends. I am Orion. Through these challenges and through that which creates disharmony and awakens you to such things, you are growing ever stronger. You are ever more capable of dealing with these conditions, ever more capable of bringing harmony into those conditions, not only those things within yourself, but those things around you because the wisdom of the soul continues to expand and deepen within you. The capacity of your soul to love continues to expand and deepen within you. 

With the power of love, as has been told to you many, many times, is the possibility of transformation, awakening and understanding. This is a truth throughout the universe. The power of love is the power to transform, to bring greater harmony and to bring peace. There is only one way, that is the way of the soul awakened to love. When the soul is awakened to the highest love of all, the greatest, most powerful energy in existence which is the Essence of God, then you cannot be but awakened and be transformed. 

You have found the key. You have made the choice. You have opened the door and you have walked through that door. How blessed you are, my beloved friends, for there are few who have consciously done so. Those who have done so often face great challenges for this contradicts the common thread of thought in the world. It is contrary to the ambitions and goals that humanity sets forth for itself. Humanity, in general, does not understand their own personal workings, what God has placed within them, the potentials that exist. So humanity looks outward into the world, trying to understand the material components of it, setting forth to manipulate that which is the world for their benefit and the benefit of their families and for the benefit of many, but that benefit is a shallow blessing. It does not reach down into the bedrock of truth. Rather most of you continue to live upon the surface of your reality and thinking.

Thus those matters that are very important indeed, tend to get ignored by many. There is a sense that all is progressing in the right direction, on the right path as the material-minded consciousness of humanity continues to expedite and take advantage of the resources that are available to them. As this exploitation continues, then the foundational structure that is part of life is being eroded by the delusional perspective of humanity. This erosion continues under the surface. Because so many are not aware nor do they choose to be aware, and they are fooled by a sense of complacency and comfort. Thus, when the time comes when the structure collapses and it shall do so, my friends, certainly within your lifetime, then the shock and surprise will be great. There will be terrible suffering, terrible disillusionment and disharmony in your world, as what is familiar is eroded away and collapses into chaos.

You, my friends, on the other hand, are building a solid foundation. You are looking deeper than many around you and you are using the knowledge and truth that you understand to build for you something that is formidable and lasting, utilising what God has to give to each one of you to strengthen and validate your journey and to bring vitality to your being, your soul. When things begin to collapse and the dominoes fall, you will be strong. You will be able to explain and to uphold, to teach and to inspire those who are willing to listen.

It is not by chance that you are so spread out around the globe, not only you but your cohorts, for you will be needed in these various places. It is indeed important that you continue to strengthen your relationships and to pray together as you do often. The process of building light, building your own souls’ vitality through prayer, receiving the great gift of God’s Love, will be all that you can stand upon in those times of change. It will be your rock. It will be your foundation. 

In this will come the inspiration, the guidance and the blessings. All around you will be panic and disarray while you are strong and at peace. Like the old story of your beloved brother, Jesus, crossing the lake in the boat during a storm while his friends and disciples panicked, he slept. He was at peace. He knew he would be safe and they would be safe. It will be like this. Though I must say, you will not be allowed to sleep. Instead you must stand up and be forthright with the truth. Speak to those who will listen. Speak to anyone and bring comfort and assurance that all will be well in the end.

Change does not come readily, my friends. Change often, in your world at least, brings a measure of discomfort, fear and mistrust. When great change comes to this world, you will be able to rely upon the sensitivities and gifts of your soul to assure you and to give you the vision, the insight that you require in order to understand and to be at peace.
 
Continue to seek the great Love of God as your first and foremost goal and application of truth. For this is the key, as I have said. It will open the door to these things. It will bring you to that place of peace, understanding, compassion and love, of all things that are of light. They will come as a result of your efforts, and your efforts will correlate with the strength and light within. Again, I urge you to take seriously the time that you have and to pray seriously for the blessings that you require. God will guide you. God will protect you. The great Source of all has His plan and will continue to enact His plan through many and if you are strong enough, brave enough, loving enough, lit enough, then you will be a part of this plan. 

You will be used not through the avenues of your own mindful composition of truth and ideas as to how to go about dealing with the struggles at hand. Rather, it will be through faith and trust in your Creator and your friends in spirit from stellar places, from Celestial Heaven to work through you as instruments and as initiators to bring change. The development of your soul, the awakening of your soul, the understanding of your soul is of the utmost importance. Thus, we give this message time and time again. We try as we must to inspire you along the road toward greater soul awakening, greater soul development, greater soul wisdom, that love may shine through everything that you are and everything that you do.

My beloved friends, continue on your progress. Continue to seek that which is of truth, light and love. Your friend, Orion, walks with you as do many, many others. Our love is with you. We gather around to support and uplift, inspire and love. We are your friends, always and your allies In the attempt to bring peace and harmony to your world. Blessings to you, my friends, Love, Love Divine to your souls, upliftment always, protection always, peace always. God bless you. God bless you all. Orion loves you.
