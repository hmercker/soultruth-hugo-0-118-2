John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John. I wish to thank you all for being here today to lift up your longings to God to receive His blessing of Divine Love into your souls.

We in the Celestial Heavens join you to bring about greater light onto this Earth that is in such great need of healing. All of the soul brothers and sisters look to the Father and ask on behalf of those living upon the Earth for God's mercy for the things that are occurring on a daily basis. They are unloving to others, but also to themselves. As Jesus said upon the cross, *“Father, they do not know what they do”.*

You, as true children of God, who do know what they do, come together and bring your light together with our light and those of many Divine Love souls upon this planet and across the universe. Ask the Father to bring more Light, more Truth and more Love to help these souls who do not know what they do to themselves and to this Earth and all who live upon it.

Deeply, go deeply, long for this Love to fill this Earth, to bring it back into harmony, to bring the truth of God's Love to those who continue to live upon this Earth, that not only they will learn, but that their children will learn and their children. This is a great endeavour that you are all part of. It is the plan that God has created to bring this world back into harmony. Pray more, dear children. Pray very often, with each other and with your guides. Invite those Celestial Angels, those stellar friends, those high spirits and those spirits in the spirit world. Invite them all to pray with you.

Let this be the party that you desire to attend, this prayer party to uplift all those upon the Earth, to bring harmony and God's Will back into the souls of humankind. Such a glorious party it would be to have all brothers and sisters joined together upon the Earth, in the spirit world and across the universe. Such a glorious party, all to receive the highest gift, the sacred gift of the Father's Essence. It rains down upon us now, dear children. Open wide. Receive the blessings that our Father has for each one of you and for us.

May God bless you deeply. May you open widely. May you enjoy the Father's gifts for you. I am John, my sister's soulmate. My prayers join together with yours. May God bless you all.
