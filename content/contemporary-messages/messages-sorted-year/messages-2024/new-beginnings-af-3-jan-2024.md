# New Beginnings in the Dominican Republic

January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024

Dominican Republic

Received by Al Fike 

Beloved souls, I am Isaiah. The world of which you inhabit is crumbling before your eyes. Though you sit in this opulence and luxury, it is an illusion. Go outside the doors, and you will see the suffering of humanity and how the systems and ways of being in the world that have been established by those in power and those with great wealth, cannot sustain itself. 

The children are lost. The children cannot find their way because they are confused by what is being told to them, what is being given to them as opportunities to establish a good life. The foundations for these teachings and rules are not correct, nor are they solid, for they are built on sand rather than rock. 
You speak of being a channel for God. A channel of love, of grace, of light. You must examine your own foundation, beloved souls. What is important to you? How may you progress upon the path and leave behind the error and the conditions that reflect that which is inappropriate for a soul in alignment with God? 
Indeed, your mind understands the concepts and your souls yearn for the growing and budding of its awakening, but often the two perspectives are not in harmony together. This disharmony is a subtle and not well recognised part of your consciousness because the mind continues to control, dictate, and say, *“I shall take the lead. I shall be the one that shall control my life.”* 

This you have learned from the beginning of your life. This is part of the human condition of this world. You have made a declaration to walk in the world as an instrument of God, as a soul in the light and the truth that is of God and God’s Love. 

Yet you have one foot planted on the material plane and all that this entails, and one in the spiritual plane and all that this entails. You go back and forth in your mind and in your soul consciousness. Often there is confusion, misunderstanding, doubt and fear because the material mind will never understand the consciousness of the soul mind until it is integrated into that consciousness. 

Before this you will have great challenges. Indeed, you apply yourself in the material way, hoping that you are truly being God’s instruments. To some degree, you are being God’s instruments, but not to the degree that is required in the times to come. For you cannot assume that your present state of consciousness of being or acting is adequate for the work ahead because it is not and will not be. You must continue to grow and stretch toward the consciousness of soul, which is very different indeed from what you are used to and exercise in your life. The time grows short. We have said this many times. Decisions now are crucial and will determine the extent of your instrumentality, your ability to serve God in the times ahead. 

Do not underestimate the power of your own soul, and the power of God’s Touch upon it. Rather, have confidence that, as you consult your own soul in prayer with God, the answers will come. The way will be clear. When there is confusion and doubt, know that you are still consulting the powerful mind, the material mind and not believing the wisdom of your soul. This is the case for each one of you here. It is not always the case. For there are times when the insights and the guidance are clear and powerful, and you do not doubt. These times will come more frequently as you grow in the Father’s Love. As you practice the capacity to communicate with your own soul, your consciousness may come into and integrate with soul consciousness. 

Practice is important. Your capacity to do so comes with prayer, or as you call meditation. That time when you are open, when you seek, when you drift downward into the soul consciousness. This is the time that is valuable and precious and utilised by your angel friends and by God’s great Soul, His Holy Spirit that comes to you. Those blessings that come through your angel friends, the blessings that come through your earthly friends. All these things conspire to lead you along the trail. 

Each one is unique, though these two dear and blessed souls share their efforts together, and you will share with others. Indeed, it is important to recognise the impediments, the stumbling blocks within yourself. The lack of faith that comes as your mind continues to reassure itself that its way and its truth is correct. Yet this is delusional. Humanity lives in this illusion. You must be the ones to break that illusion apart so that others may look clearly. In order to do so, you must be powerful within your soul, powerful in your capacity to love, powerful in your ability to perceive and to know the faculties of your own soul. This indeed may awaken and be a conscious part of yourself. 

There is much work to do, my beloved friends. I know you understand this. I know that you feel the immensity of what must be done. You look at your life and think that you are inadequate, or at least that your life at this time is inadequate, in order to accomplish this. I say to you, my friends, that you will find your way, that we will help you, that God is guiding you and blessing you upon the path. You must make greater effort to open yourself to this path, to keep your thoughts aligned with this path, to be in alignment with God and to be close to God always. To be His instruments, my friends, is a great challenge. It is readily given and possible if you are willing and walk the road prescribed. 

May you blessed, beloved friends. I am Isaiah. I come with serious words. Clear, but you ask for guidance. You seek to know. We give to you what you require. Although we feed you drop by drop so that you may indeed continue to yearn. For we can not feed you great quantities of truth. You are not capable of absorbing this, and you would be overwhelmed by it. It is given in increments and in timing that is appropriate. This will continue. This will continue. 

We will be with you always, my beautiful, beautiful friends of Earth. We will be with you always. God bless you. May His Love continue to pour into your soul. For it is in these Living Waters that the truth is revealed. The understanding of the soul comes as it is awakened by the elixir of love. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you in His Love.
