May the Light of God’s Love and Truth be with you, beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. I come. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you and I come to help you and uplift you in the light. As you pray for your brothers and sisters both here upon your world and in the spirit world, may you come to realise that many angels are here to help and to uplift all those you pray for.

I am close to you, beloved souls. Some I am very close to because within their hearts and souls, they have a desire for this. Within their soul is a light shining as a result of their prayers to receive the great gift of God’s Love. Yet, I am with each of you to some degree and I desire to be closer with each of you. So, if you are in need and you think of me, then you open the door for my presence and for my light and love to shine upon you.

This is not only true for myself but for all the angels of Heaven. When you are in need and when you have a desire to be in alignment with God and the Truth of God’s Love, you have faith and you put this forth in prayer, then we are close. We may establish a strong rapport and you may feel our presence with you. If your thoughts are filled with that of the material, then it makes it difficult for you to know us or for us to be close to you. When you are pure in your thoughts and your desires for the higher blessings, the great blessing of God’s Love, then we are very close.

It is important that you realise that you determine the closeness of this rapport. If you are shielded by many thought conditions, then it is difficult to know us. If you put aside those thought conditions and are able to rest yourself away from the material conditions of the world, then you will feel our presence. For when you are in prayer to receive God’s great Love, do you not feel the grace of God’s Touch upon you? In that grace, we are there. We long to support you, beloveds. We long that you may know us and that you may feel our love for you. We long for you to be in the grace of God and know the light of His Love burning within you, influencing and affecting all that is around you and within you. 

This is the grace of which I speak. This is the blessing that God wishes for you to have and to know. To feel this grace is to know great peace and great joy. To express this grace in your life is to help establish greater light upon the world. To acknowledge that you are a child of God and truly embraced by God is to ensure that all these blessings may be yours. 

Seek for the highest, beloved souls. Seek for the blessing, the endowment of His Love within your soul, that you may truly break free of the human condition and live in a world that is of light, that is in harmony and that is of God. In this, you will know the joy of a soul awakening and flourishing in the grace of God’s Love. Seek that Love above all else, beloveds, and all these things will come to you in time. 

Even those who struggle to know us, in time, a way will be offered. An avenue of knowledge and acknowledgement will be given. God does not forsake you because you do not feel these things that I speak of. It is merely that you are a victim of the human condition. It is a struggle. It is a struggle to break free of these conditions. Firstly, you must free yourself of a mind so set in these conditions that it cannot break free of its own accord. Rather, you must ask for help from your angel friends and from God’s blessing to help quell the busyness of the mind and to put aside those thoughts that are unloving toward yourself or toward others.

Be at peace, beloved souls, not seeking to fight your way into acknowledgement and recognition of the material sort, but to be at peace and to know that you are with God. In this way, you will engender blessings and acknowledgement from others, for they will feel the beautiful, soothing and comforting condition that you carry. This will be a greater boon to them than anything you might offer in a material way. 

Be the light, beloveds. Do not forsake the desires of your soul, but acknowledge them, be true to them and you will find your way to all that is of God. To have the perceptions and the faculties of the soul, awakening by the Love, will give you that which you desire and acknowledgement and proof of the truth of this Love and the truth of our existence and the existence of God, so that it will be undeniable within you. In this state of faith and surety, you will be an example to others and you will be able to lead others to the great truth of God’s Love and blessings upon them.

I speak these things to again affirm the truth. Truth not only to you but to the many souls who are arrayed around you, that this truth is the salvation of which I spoke so many years ago and it continues to be the salvation that shall bring a soul to oneness with God.
May you be blessed, beloveds. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom and truly, I am with you, my beloved friends, and I love you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
