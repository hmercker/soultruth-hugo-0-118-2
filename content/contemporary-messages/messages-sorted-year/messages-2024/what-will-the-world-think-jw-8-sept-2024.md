# What will the world think of you? 

September 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

Oh My!

What will the world think of you?

Everyone wrapped up in their little ball 

Of self-limitation 

Endlessly rotating on its own axis 

Unaware of its rightful place 

In the Firmament of  Celestial bodies 

Why waste time 

In endless speculation

In useless considerations

Of what the world thinks?

Feast your eyes 

On the great banquet

That the King has prepared 

For all

His love is beyond compare 

But only His loyal subjects 

Sit at the table 

Choose your words wisely 

For they reverberate 

In the chambers of your soul

And throughout the Cosmos 

Allow if you can 

Each one 

Their own destiny 

As you focus on your souls

Endless journey in love

I am Hafiz
