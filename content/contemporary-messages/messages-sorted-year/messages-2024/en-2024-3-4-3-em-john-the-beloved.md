# God’s Divine Love is More Pervasive, More Powerful, So Much More Loving Than Anything

Online Prayer Circles, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John. You can almost hear the tenor of my voice. I am John the beloved. I and many others join you in this prayer today and in many of your prayers today. We desire to uplift you and all upon this Earth who pray to our Father, who ask for the Love to come into their souls to uplift them and to bring them closer to the truth of who they are and what they are.

They are God's children. They are God's true children. They are the ones who God embraces, cares for and allows to make decisions for themselves, if they so choose. Those who desire to be at one with His Will are brought forward to be instruments, to be channels of light and to brighten the world with their service of bringing the Father's Love into this world to a greater extent. For as the world continues to spin, there are those who prefer to look away from God and do their own thing, make their own choices with such limitations that there is great harm being done upon the Earth and in the Earth.

You who choose to follow God's Will are more of a counterbalance, stronger, lighter, brighter and more pervasive than those who choose to go their own way. Remember this as you go out into the world and speak to people. Remember that God's Divine Love is more pervasive, more powerful, so much more loving than anything that any individual can accomplish. As she has spoken, spend more time in prayer seeking a greater relationship with the Father that you may see more clearly what it is that you are and what it is you are to do.

I thank my host for allowing me to come close and speak so clearly. I offer you all my blessings. May the Father's blessings fall upon your souls that are open and receptive. May your souls accept, receive and integrate these blessings into your being. May God bless you with His Love, so very abundant and so willing to give to you, His children. God bless you. I am John the Beloved. I will step back now.
