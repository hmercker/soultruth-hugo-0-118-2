# Your Joy and Divine Love in Your Souls Touches All Those Around You!

September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Eastern United States Soul Awakening Tour, Nashville, TN, USA

Alec Gaunt received by Al Fike

Yes, I am Alec, and I have enjoyed your interactions, the levity with which you have shared your love this evening. It is good to allow the joy to come forward as often as possible in every and any situation you find yourselves in, for that too is of God. Your sharing is expressing the love with which God has imbued you with and it extends outward to all those souls in your immediate vicinity. So, this is a good thing, a loving thing. We too, in the Celestial Heavens, enjoy moments of frivolity. Although they are few and far between as we watch over you humans, chuckle, chuckle. As you can see, I too have grown in this joyfulness.

We look forward to the coming days of your visit with these souls in Nashville and yes, go on, go out and about. Spread your love. As you walk the streets, spend time in many places. Because all will be impacted in their souls by your presence. Not just your joyfulness, but your very presence brings truth to the souls of those who are open. In this community there are many souls who are open, seeking, desiring, but not really knowing what it is that they desire. This is a fertile, rich environment of souls. So, be open to many opportunities to be and to love. Do not be self conscious. Just be.

My dear sister, you are glorious in your work. I watch you from my home and feel satisfaction that we were once together in prayer in the human form. You are a joy to me and I look forward to many more times of being with you in prayer. You, my dear brother, you need not worry about souls, whether or not you have touched them. You will see the measure of your work in truer form when you join us in this world in which I live. You will be most surprised at your efforts and the results that they bring, and continue to bring. Rest assured, you will be gratified and perhaps surprised.

Now, I give you my blessings. I say to you that my love for you is very deep and strong and will always be, and even stronger. My love is with you, all of you in this room, all who are here. There are some who have come, have followed you, for they see the light and they desire to know more. So, pray for them as you continue your prayers and may God bless you. May the Father bless you with all that He has to give to you and may you open to receive all that you are worthy of receiving. God bless you. I am Alec, your brother, and I will be close throughout this trip, this part of the trip. God bless you. My love is with you and it is deep.
