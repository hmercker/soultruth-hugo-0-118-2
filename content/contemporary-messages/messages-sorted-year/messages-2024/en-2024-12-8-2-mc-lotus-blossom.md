# Hope Within Every Soul

December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you, dear friends. It is Lotus Blossom. As you pray for the great inflowing of God's Love, you draw me near. For within each one's heart, there is a desire to serve, to be a beacon of light, to be of good faith, and to experience the never-ending joy that comes through the peace that passes all understanding. All of this comes in the wave of Divine Love flowing into your souls, transforming your substance into one of divinity. As you approach what many on your Earth call Christmas Day, in this time of celebration where you can gather with loved ones, it is a time where there is the greatest light on Earth.

Within every soul that acknowledges this day, that is known as Christ's birthday, there is hope within the soul of the individual. Even in those who seem to be rather downtrodden or on hard times, there is a glimmer of hope that is ignited within the soul that brings some small bearing of relief to them. It is a time that those who are in the heavens and desire to bring healing to Earth come very close, for the hope that is in the hearts and souls of man draws us, attracts us. It allows us to come a little closer than at other times of your year. You can feel it in the air, some joy. There is a lightness that can be experienced.

Yes, it is true that this time of the year can also be very difficult for some. Yet even within those, there is a hope. A hope for better times, a hope for greater ease, a calling out for love, a more openness in the heart. So, dear ones, you can use this time as a catalyst for the collective energies that do help to establish some small shift in the consciousness that covers the world. Use this time to be of deeper faith. Come into alignment between your will and God's Will, knowing that God will show you and having certainty in what you feel within yourself. For the soul will give you promptings through the feelings and visions that can come to you, a knowing. You may not be able to explain or verbalise what it is that you know through your soul's consciousness.

Yet you align within all of that. You flow, you follow, and you trust. Allow yourself to soften your demeanor, to not always be so serious within your spiritual pursuits. For when you are very serious, your heart is closed. That doorway is not as open to the great inflowing of God's Love. God can be experienced as a deep and loving provider, but also as a playful friend, one who has a great sense of humour and wishes to see you experience laughter, joy and be light of heart, guiding you to follow, to be prompted, to listen to those prompts and to fulfill them.

It can be that these prompts may seem small to you. Yet it is the road to awakening, because as you develop your trust in following the promptings of your soul, your mind is seeing the way to harmonise itself with the energies of the soul. Within you, you can experience a beautiful exchange, a communing between your soul and your mind. Your mind will be willing to experience more of these promptings and also express desire and wonderment with curiosity about the workings of the soul it serves. For in its highest form, its highest demeanor, your mind serves the soul. It is an instrument, just as your body is, to be prompted, to be orchestrated, and to be moved by the energies of your soul, the spirit of your soul.

All of this awakens because of your obtaining of the Divine Love. You are fulfilling the Law of Love as you continue to receive more and more of God's Essence. As you do so, all things change. All parts of you become harmonious, filled with light, expressive with Love, the experience of the peace that passes all understanding, and feeling at home in your body, for it is the instrument that carries your true essence while here on Earth. As you continue to develop in your soul awakening, there is the possibility of experiencing that oneness within you where your soul, your mind, and your body are in great harmony, flowing together as one, these three parts of you.

So, dear ones, be of good faith. Trust the process of your awakening but also challenge yourself. What is it that you do desire? What are those desires within the soul? Ask God to awaken those within you. For when you move and you walk here on Earth with the desires of your soul generating a life, a creative life, you will feel deeply purposeful. It does not mean that you need to be on a grand stage of people, collecting other souls, introducing them to the Divine Love. What it means is to experience yourself, to truly come to know who you are, to embody your soul, and for you to live a life informed from this place within you.

May you all be greatly blessed. We are very close to you. We bring our light, we bring our blessings, and we walk with you. It is through the Essence of God's Love that the New Birth is possible. We walk hand in hand with each one of you as you develop, as your time, your gestation of this transformation, moves along. I am Lotus Blossom. My love, my blessings are with each of you. God bless you.
