…awakening and blessings, changes and many things that will bring joy. Surprises are coming, some changes within you. Some blessings that will come in the transformation of your souls will come in such a way that you will hardly recognise yourself and what is truly within you. Allow God’s Hand to make what it will with you, for God knows and is wise and will bring about the manifestations and transformations that will turn you into a formidable and beautiful force for good. Each of you are undergoing this transformation. Each of you will be surprised at what will come and how it will come. So many blessings are lined up before you that will be realised and given to you that you did not expect. 

Do not feel unworthy, beloved souls. Instead, feel joyful with great gratitude for the generosity of God. The bounty of God’s Touch that will bring to you the awakenings of your soul in all their glory and wonderment. As God brings the transformation to this world, you will know it within you and come to appreciate how God has prepared you for what is to come. God will utilise you in many ways to bring blessings to others, to ignite a transformation in them. You will see with the eyes of your souls what truly might be as God comes more fully into your life, into your consciousness, into your soul. You will be changed forever and that change will bring greater harmony, greater insight and greater gifts as love permeates every part of you and brings its blessings forth in all the light and love that you could possibly receive and embrace. 

So much awaits each of you. So much is given freely and abundantly, without restriction. Without any expectations from God, other than to dance with joy and feel deeply the great Love that He has for you. Be free in this Love. Be true to this Love and allow all that is meant to be to manifest within you and around you. In this way, you will be God’s perfect angels, instruments, harbingers of truth and light. Blessed, blessed are you, beloved souls. Blessed are you upon the road to becoming another of God’s angels entering into the Celestial Kingdom and being another light within that Kingdom. 

I am Goldie and I love you. At times I find your conversations strange, even amusing. At other times I am touched by your loving demeanour toward one another and how you care for one another, care for this world, care for your brothers and sisters. How beautiful that is and how it is truly God working through you. For when you have compassion, when you are graceful and loving, then you are truly reflecting God. That part of Him that continues to grow within you. That Essence reflecting the wonderment of God. You are truly my brothers and sisters and I look forward to the day when I can accompany you into Heaven. We will dance and sing our way in, a joyful event in acknowledging the wonderment of God’s great gift of Love. I will be joined by many others. Indeed, the great Master, Jesus, will be in front leading the way and bringing the light.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I love you so. I am with you so often. I know you do not feel me, my presence, so much. But I am there along with many others, seeking to guide and protect, envelop and to love. We are there, always. We are there because we love you so and shall never leave you. We will continue together on the journey toward at-onement with God. A journey that never ends. A journey that only gets better as we progress. A journey that brings many, many blessings, openings and awarenesses, truth and love. Deeper, greater as we discover how deep is God’s ocean of Love, how wide is His ocean of Love, how truly, truly awesome is His ocean of Love. 

Thank you for taking this journey with me. I am so blessed to walk with you and to love you, my beautiful mortal friends. I love you. I love you. I love you. God bless you. God bless you all.
