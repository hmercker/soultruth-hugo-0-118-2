# Faith

March 24<sup>th</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

Thomas Aquinas & Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am **Thomas**. I’ve been called “Doubting Thomas.” I would like to lose that nomenclature. For I am full of faith and love, the love of my Heavenly Father.  Developing faith takes time and more importantly, prayers, prayers to the Father to infuse His love and all those other blessings, including faith into the soul. But that is only part of it. Extending that faith, expressing that faith in those moments when the faith is most greatly required. Faith is a gift, one that must be used. It is also a gift that helps along your path of progression. The more you express it, the further your reach along your progress to your Father until eventually you reach that place where you know that God has you by the hands for each step that you continue to progress. And still, there is more to go but you know you walk with God.

It is no longer a question. It is a knowing. It is an absolute truth that you are with God as you exercise this faith. So dear children, now is the time for you to extend your faith even in little ways so that you may progress and come to that place of fully knowing the truth of that faith within you. God bless you. I am Thomas and I thank you for allowing me to speak today. It is our first time, but it won’t be our last. And to all of you who are here, may God bless you abundantly with this faith of which I speak. May God bless you. May God bless you as the love pours down upon you. God bless you.

Our beloved brother, Jesus comes, bringing gifts from the Father to each one within the circle. Pray to be open to receive these gifts and feel his light and love surround you and touch you. I am **Joan** and I accompany my Master today to also bring gifts for you to utilize in your progression and your varying ministries which are being developed as we speak. Stay open, dear children. You are being worked on as well as being gifted.
