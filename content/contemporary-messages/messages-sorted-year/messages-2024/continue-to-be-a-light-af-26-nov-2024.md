May the blessings of God infill your souls, that they may be brimming and overflowing in Love. My name is Miriam. You know me as Miriam in the Bible. I am a Celestial inhabitant, an angel of God and I have been in the Kingdom for a very long time. But that does not mean that I have forgotten my brothers and sisters on the Earth plane, for I continue to pray for you all and, at times, come to the Earthly Sphere to help and to minister to you. 

I am one of many millions of angels that continue to do the work of God, to bring the blessings of God through to all of you, to uplift you, protect you, guide you, love you and embrace you. For you are tender and vulnerable souls who continue to walk a road contrary to what is common in your world. I encourage you upon that road, for how else is change accomplished but through the efforts, thoughts, deeds and prayers of individuals who are determined to bring light and, when they recognise truth, are determined to live truth? 

We did so upon the Earth plane when we were there, following the teachings of truth, being loving and being lights in the world. So, I encourage you to do the same, for there is always a current of darkness. There are always the oppressors. There is always an element that foments anger, hatred and fear. This is the human condition and you know it well. It is important that you are a contradiction to that. That you continue to be a light, beaming forth for all the world to see, so those who are in need and those who are lost may find comfort in your light, may be blessed by your channel of love, as God uses each one of you to uphold your brothers and sisters.

There is so much work to do, beloveds. Do you have any idea how important it is to affirm your dedications to God, to be that light and be that beacon of truth in the world, to be loving to all you meet and to be loving to yourselves? For when you are centred in love, when you are truly a light, solid and in alignment with God, oh, how powerful the blessings can be, how many things may be accomplished through you to help contradict the darkness and bring greater light to the world.

I ask you not to falter, beloved souls, but to be true to all that is of goodness and light. You have around you many beautiful bright spirits, angels and even those from other worlds. What a great grouping of light spirits surrounds each one of you. How blessed you are to have this and to benefit from it. The world needs you more than ever. This is why God sends so many beautiful spirits to you, so that you are upheld, blessed, inspired and given much that is of light and expansive, protecting you and inspiring you. I come to uplift you, beloveds. I am with you often. Though you may not know me, I am one of the many who are with you and make efforts to uphold you.

God ensures that you are never alone. God ensures that light is always around you. I urge you to make that choice for light with every breath, every thought, every deed, everything that you are and everything that you do. Be a light. It is possible for you. As you make that choice, so you draw us closer by the Law of Attraction, by the benefits of your soul glowing in Love. You draw us closer and you have that feeling, that sense of upliftment and you are at peace.

May the blessings of God continue to uphold you, beloved souls. In this, you will know how truly blessed you are, that your lives are populated by angels, beautiful and bright, by bright spirits whose intentions are pure and of the highest, by beautiful beings that exist in other worlds that are making great effort to uphold yours. So much God gives to His beloved children, for He loves you so. Everything that He does is for your benefit and a great blessing to all those who are receptive. The world is being healed of the darkness and all the desecrations that humanity has made upon it. The world is being uplifted as you are, beloveds, and it will find harmony and peace in time.

Have faith in this. Have faith in your own journey toward God and you will be blessed and rewarded with much light, joy, love and peace. It is given and shall be given in greater measure as you seek out this blessing of Love and find your place with God. God bless you. I am Miriam and I love you, each one precious to God, precious to the angels and precious to many. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you in His Love, always.
