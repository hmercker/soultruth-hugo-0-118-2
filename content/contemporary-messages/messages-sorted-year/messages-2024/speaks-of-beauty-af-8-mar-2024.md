Beloved and beautiful children of God, I am Immanuel.<sup>1</sup> I come to pray with you today. I come to comment on this beautiful sanctuary of light that you have created, this place filled with God’s creations shining forth. The place within you, the beautiful garden of your souls shining forth in the Father’s Love. You are blessed in many ways. Indeed, God looks after each of you and ensures that your life is filled with blessings and much is given. Much is given to each one of you. In return, all that God asks is that you love Him. Love Him with all your heart and soul. Be in love with God. To have the simple and yet deep perception of the beauty of God’s creation, the beauty of your own creation, the beauty of God’s laws that govern creation and govern the re-creation of your soul with His Love. 

My beloved friends, what is there in life that is so precious than to acknowledge your Creator? Acknowledge what He has created within you. Acknowledge the beauty, the wonderment of His great Soul, His Soul’s expression in the world. My beloved friends, you will open your eyes even further. Greater perceptions will you have, and greater gifts reflecting the creation of your soul and what is within that creation, multiple expressions of a soul awakened in the Essence of God. These things are beautiful, their expressions profound, the light great. With this comes profound joy and upliftment as you reflect a transformation within that comes as you receive the great gift of His Love.

My beloved friends, I am Immanuel. I am a resident of the Celestial Kingdom, a soul reborn in Love. One who does not come often to speak, but I am here to acknowledge you. To acknowledge the beauty all around you and within you. My beloved friends, my love is with you. I come at times to inspire this dear brother in front of me so that he may continue to express the creativity and beauty of his soul. God bless you, my friends, in His Love. It comes as you long for its gift within. God bless you. God bless you all, beloveds. 

**Note 1**

It is not clear if this is Immanuel Kant, who expressed interest in Divine Love via James Padgett in December 1917, or the Old Testament Immanuel who to my knowledge we have not previously heard from. In the Old Testament this is no more than the name of a Jewish child who is referred to in a prophecy in Isaiah 7–8. The medium has confirmed he does not have any information on this spirit.
