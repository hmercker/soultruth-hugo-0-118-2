# Your Capacity to Receive Guidance Deepens

December 21<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Continue to walk upon the path designated beautiful, beautiful souls of service who endeavour to bring the Truth of Divine Love to the world. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am pleased that you are willing to keep the doors open and be open in your minds and your ideas as to how this effort will unfold and be effective in the world. Indeed, we are guiding you and you shall receive guidance. Do not put guidance aside thinking you are unworthy or that you do not have the faculties that will bring the guidance forward. This is not true. It is important that you realise that as you progress, as you continue to develop as God's instruments, then your capacity to be guided and to be shown the way will deepen and broaden. You will find your way. It will become clear, beautiful and blessed.

My beloved and beautiful children, students, God continues to bless you. Indeed, as you continue to venture forth into the world, you will find those blessings will multiply and, indeed, your instrumentalities and gifts will multiply with the blessings of the Father's Love. Though they may seem subtle day by day, if you take it year by year, they are quite tremendous and powerful. Acknowledge this, beloved children. Acknowledge your way, your journey toward truth, toward deeper instrumentality and deeper capacities to serve God. For is not all of this, all these efforts, all of these times and opportunities, are they not designed for God to reach out to many and for you to be an able, active and effective instrument for God? So you are, beloved souls. As you continue to grow in Love and desire to serve, so you are able servants for God.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine and we are pleased with your progress. We will continue to guide, and you will continue to listen and put into practice, into the physical reality, that which God intends and that which God plans on this great venture for the salvation of humanity. God bless you. Your teacher, Augustine, loves you. God bless you.
