# Thank You for Inviting Us to Pray with You

March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2024

Liverpool, NY, USA

John, from the 7th Sphere, received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, John and I breathe deeply in these waters, these living waters for the truth lies within them and I seek more of my Father’s truth. I am a 7th spherian who comes often to this prayer circle to pray with my beloved brothers and sisters, whose sincerity is deep, whose love is getting stronger, who participates in many of the circles so that more and more of the love will flow into their souls. I anxiously await your arrival into these upper spheres and into the Celestial Heavens where I hope to go very soon. But I have come to thank you for inviting those of us in the spirit world to pray with you. For this is how I came to be in the 7th sphere, by praying with you and opening my soul to God’s mercy and love. And that will be the way that you, too, will progress. I must go now and step back, but I will continue to pray with you as will many who are here and who are interested in progressing their souls in this love. We appreciate your circles of light. May our Father bless each and every one of you. I am John from the 7th Sphere.
