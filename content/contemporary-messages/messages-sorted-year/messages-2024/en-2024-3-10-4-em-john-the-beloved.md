John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, beloved brothers and sisters. I am John, John the Beloved. I come to you today to offer my assistance, to offer my love and to offer my blessings to you, dear souls upon the screen, those in the spirit world and those around the world. Wherever there is light, we, the Celestial Angels, come en masse today to bring blessings that you may procure by opening your souls and lifting your hearts and souls in love to our Heavenly Father, that He too may bless you abundantly this day.

My brothers and sisters, true children of God, it is true that you have come to this Earth at this time to be in service to your Heavenly Father and to your brothers and sisters upon the Earth plane. Willingly, lovingly, go forward in your missions, step by gentle step, lovingly in each step, for you are greatly guided, greatly cherished and greatly protected. Bring forth your willingness and meet the Father's Will. Join together. You will accomplish your purpose upon this Earth in helping God to transform what is a dark place into one of great light.

This is your purpose. This is your mission. This is what you elected to do upon your incarnation into this world. We stand beside you and around you. God's Love protects you. Let us go forward. Let us go forward in this Love together, joining Love in our souls, hands in hearts, to help transform this beautiful Earth into a harmonious, loving and peaceful place in which more humans who have yet to come will be able to reside.

God bless you, dear children. Our love is with you, as is the Father's as it rains down upon you. Now open wide, dear ones. Open wide and let the Father fill your souls. May God bless you all days of your lives upon this Earth, as well as beyond your mortal days. I bless you. I am John the Beloved. I will be with you.
