It is Bartholomew. It is good that you've gathered together in this way. The lights that you carry combined together to make a great light. A light that shines forth upon this island. A light that we can utilise to do our work for the peoples of this island and other islands. 

As you stitch together the tapestry of faithful souls who are willing to be with God and to be a channel of God, God's blessings for the world, this Lattice of Light builds. It expands the beautiful efforts of each of you and many, many more in the spirit of the world and the Celestial Kingdom working diligently to help clear away the darkness. It brings the hope, the awakening, the truth that comes with the blessing of God's Love upon your world. Much is still to be accomplished, beautiful friends. We will work together in this time together as we did in other places, as we will continue to do so in places that will be your visitation and efforts together in the future. 

You see how God works, His plan unfolding, the efforts being made. Though these things may seem subtle to your material mind and brain, they are powerful to the soul. This is where you must see, acknowledge and live within the soul consciousness. This we have beseeched you to do over and over again. It is the only way that this work may be satisfying to you, beloved friends. For without your soul awakening to God, without your soul being truly expressed to yourself, without the gifts of your soul being utilised by your angel friends and all that God has put into place to help awaken humanity, then your efforts will continue to be meagre and your conscious understanding of them will be slight indeed. 

You must awaken in your soul consciousness. That is done, as we have told you many times, through deep prayer and longing to receive the great gift of God's Love. This ignites the faculties. This brings to you a powerful insight and understanding that only the soul can bring. There is much work for you to do upon yourself. There is much work for you to do in this world. There is much work that God wishes to be accomplished before times in your world make it more difficult to travel and connect as you do at this time. Take advantage of these situations and blessings. 

Be together in harmony and peace. Pray together as often as you can. It is in these prayerful sessions that much is accomplished. The weave continues to become more complex and beautiful. The strength of this material is great and increases as you add your blessings, your love, your light to it in the willingness, humility and peace of the Father's Love.

May you be blessed beloved souls, truly, deeply, wonderfully blessed in this love, in your friendship and fellowship and in all that you do together as God's instruments in the world. God bless you. I am Bartholomew. I love you. Deeply, truly I love you, my friends on Earth, precious souls, each one precious beyond reckoning. God bless you.
