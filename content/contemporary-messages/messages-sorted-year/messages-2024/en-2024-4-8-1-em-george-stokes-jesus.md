George Stokes & Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now. I am George Stokes. In all the universe, there are those who pray to receive the gifts that God has for their souls, for their minds and even for their bodies. You, dear children upon the Earth, your prayers are deep and sincere. Your longings are great and true and yes, the love flows into your souls and into ours as we gather close to you and uplift you in honor to our Father who resides in the highest heavens.

The love flows deeply, abundantly. Open widely. Accept all that God has to give. Trust in your Father. Trust in the love that you have already. Trust in your brothers and sisters to help you to progress and love your Father. Join with Him. Join with Him. And let your love become one. I am your brother, George and you are blessed, mightily, abundantly, totally, completely by the Father’s hand and grace and love, each according to his longings and desires. Strengthen those longings. Strengthen those desires. Allow the Father to fill you with this love that is so available to you, each one individually, specifically. God bless you, children. God bless you mightily. I am your brother, George Stokes. We often pray together with you to receive the most high into our souls.

And our brother, Jesus comes in radiance and wonder to bless us.

You are beloved. You are all and each special to my Father and to me for the work that you do upon this Earth as my disciples. On behalf of your brothers and sister, whom you will love more and more as you receive more of this love, more of the Father’s will, more of the truth of your relationship to our Father and to your brothers and sisters, this is the gift that I come to bring that our Father has sent me to give to you: the gift of love for your brothers and sisters upon this Earth and even those in the spirit world. For you will work with both to uplift, to heal, to inspire, to point the direction to our Father. You are empowered with this precious, precious gift of love from your Father to your souls, to love all of humankind and all of those in the spirit world who are in need of your assistance.

I am your brother, Jesus and I come as the Master of the Celestial Heavens to empower you to love all who come to you, to bless all who come to you, to choose who you serve, how you serve and where you serve. I thank you. I love you. I am your brother and your Master in this work and in these Celestial Heavens and I look forward to greeting each one of you when you transition. May God bless you. May God bless you with peace, light, love, joy and happiness. I love you, my brothers and sisters, dearly. God bless you.
