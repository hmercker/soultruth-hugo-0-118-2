# Guidance for French Speaking Divine Love Circle of Light

Souls from all over the world are coming to a place of seeking truth. Souls all over the world are yearning and desiring to be in the Light of God's Love. My beloved friends, I am your teacher, Augustine. 

The challenges that you face in your countries, in this area of the world, are great. There is not often an overt desire to know the Truth of God in all its simplicity. There are many who are involved in dogma and church-like pursuits and are very dedicated. These souls, too, are yearning for God. But, the way that you are yearning for God, precious and beautiful souls that you are, is that of the simple connection between you and your Creator, receiving the great gift of His Essence within your soul. In this pursuit, you will find deep connection and deep rewards.

We are not putting to the forefront metaphysical pursuits, although, as you can well see, we do engage in mediumship in order to communicate. The angels of the Celestial Heavens wish to communicate with each one of you. But, the primary goal is receiving the great gift of God's Love, the foundation of Truth. In this way, the faculties of your souls and your minds come into greater alignment and you are able to perceive truth in this deep way, something that is not altogether of the mind, but rather the mind of the soul engaged and awakened with this beautiful gift of Love.

Be clear with your desires, your direction, your goals and your priorities. It is easy to have great distractions with many spiritual influences and spirits around you. This happens to every individual upon the earthly plane, though few are aware and few understand the laws that attract spirit. In the pursuit of God's Love, one goal is to attract the highest, to attract the Celestial angels who are of the greatest light and possess the greatest Love. They will crowd around you. They will help you and protect you. But, it is important that you seek that protection and that rapport, otherwise, the angels become one of the crowd of spirits that are with you. It becomes easy for you to not recognise or understand their presence, for there are other influences that may bring a more powerful presence with them.

Because you are of the earthly plane and the conditions of Earth, it is easier to make rapport, to connect and understand the influence of these spirits. I am not saying that this is of darkness or negativity. Rather, it is a different way, the way of natural love. I wish to help you discern the difference between the two. My desire and our desire as your guides and gatekeepers, those from the Celestial Heavens, is that you will seek for the highest and not allow this mixture of influence to carry you along a road that can be often confusing and contradictory.

It is a great challenge, beloved souls, to walk the road of God's Divine Love and to forsake other roads, other interests. It is a challenge. But, indeed, if you seek to open the faculties of your soul and the mind of your soul, then this is the way, the only way, to do so. All other ways open the faculties of the mind, the material mind, the spirit mind and the spirit experiences that come with the spirit body. There is only one way to open the soul that it may grow, expand and develop in alignment with God's great Soul. That is with the Divine Love of God, seeking it, receiving it, being focused upon it and not being distracted by earthly cares and curiosities about the spirit world and your own spirit body.

Though these things often bring questions and curiosities, I wish to maintain that in order to have these questions answered, first and foremost, you must be dedicated to developing your own soul. In this way, all truth comes, but it comes in its own time and in its own way, rather than forcing and deliberating upon the desires of the mind to know truth in the more material sense.

My beautiful, beautiful friends, we welcome you and wish to make a deep rapport with each one of you. It is your choice, the road that you might take. Indeed, God gives you great leeway as you take the road and discover for yourself the truth. God will not forsake you. But, if you wish to follow the Divine Path, the road leading to the development, awakening and transformation of the soul, it requires focus, prayer and dedication. Our wish is that you shall do so, my beautiful friends. That in doing so, you will draw us close and in drawing us close, you will have great benefits from this.

My beautiful friends, it is for you to decide, as it is for every soul to decide. Indeed, God is patient. God is generous. God gives all that you require in order to find your way. Be of good faith, be of good cheer and know that you are loved deeply and profoundly, that that Love might be yours, beloved souls. It never ends, this beautiful gift of Love. It never ends.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am happy to speak to you today. I am happy that you are here, listening and considering. I am happy to help you along the road, as are many. God bless you, beloved students. My love is with you. God bless you.


### Joan of Arc ###

I am Joan of Arc. I was a warrior in my day, a leader. You know of me well, one of your heroes in your country, in our country. But, now I fight for something different. I fight for truth. I fight that souls may come to God in Love, for there is no other fight worth engaging in than that of the soul seeking truth, that of the soul finding truth and that of the soul bringing truth into their hearts and into their lives.

This is what I fight for now and I will fight for you, beloved souls. I will fight for you, for I have great enthusiasm and desire for my countrymen to know the way of Love, to know the power of Love, the beauty of Love and the blessings and peace that come with Love. 

So, I will be with you on that journey and you will know me. You will know me in my presence. I am happy to know you and to be with you. May you be blessed with the Father's Love. I am Joan. My love is with you, beloved, beautiful brothers and sisters. My love is with you. God bless you.


### Jesus ###

I come to bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come to help show you the way to the Father's Love, to bring you peace and to assure you that this Truth shall bring you great blessings, great benefits, great openings and experiences beyond your imaginings as God's Love flows copiously into your souls and brings you what your soul's desire.

I am with you. I am with all those who seek this Truth and I shall be with you for all eternity, beloved and beautiful children of God. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you. God bless you.


### Matthew ###

Given the right approach, you will draw many yearning souls into your circles, many young souls who are seeking truth. But, it is a matter of humility and perception to try and use the words and ways that will draw your brothers and sisters close and bring you to that place where you might lead and be leaders.

The world is in need of those who can lead and those who are shining examples of truth. So it is for you, beloved souls, to seek within yourself that destiny, that soulful knowing that you are meant to bring the Truth of God's Love to the world, clear and simple, without dogma, without judgment, but with love.
God bless you. I am Matthew. God bless you, beloved souls.
