Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Joseph Babinsky received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Joseph Babinsky. I welcome you to this home that is already filled with our brothers and sisters from the Celestial Spheres. I welcome each and all of you to taste the Breath of God within you, to allow your souls to open wider, to allow your love to flow outward to each other and to build this rapport in this home, for God's Love is available and waiting. Open and allow it to flow in. As you do so, you are rising to a place above the Earth plane, to a place where you may heal and nourish your souls.

We have guided you to come here. As you know, there is a purpose in each gathering of souls. I pray for this Love of the Father and this too has a purpose. Some will be clear and some not so obvious, but your wills will determine the strength of fulfilling the purpose of this gathering. You have walked far, each of you, what may seem a long distance. Yet, you have still a way to go, as I do also. I encourage you to take your steps gradually, completely and, of course, with love.

It is my honour to be here today. I am just one of many and our brothers and sisters who guide us, who love us, are here and close to assist us in all that we have yet to learn. This medium is young in her mediumship, so I will not task her, but I will say each one has something to learn, a moment of growth, if it is your will, during this time together.

My love is with you. I thank you so much for responding to your guidance and for being willing to grow during this time. May we all receive the Father's Love in great abundance. I am Joseph Babinsky and I honour you, my brothers and sisters. I honour you and love you.
