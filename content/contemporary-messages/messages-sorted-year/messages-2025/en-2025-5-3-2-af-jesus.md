# Blessings and Praises to Close Anaheim Retreat

May 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

â€¦my beloveds. You have benefited not only yourselves, but many others who you are not aware of, but who have been praying with you and those in this area of the world who have been praying to God. There are many layers to this work, many possibilities that may be engaged and expressed in this work. Your presence in this part of the world, which is very much in need of love, light and truth, has benefited many through your prayers and our collaborations.

It is common that you engage one another over the wires, but the more powerful way is in person, as you create these Circles of Light wherever you go and will continue to do so. There is much that can be accomplished. We have worked diligently to assist you in your development, soul development and development of gifts. We have worked diligently to inspire you and to bring light into your midst. We are agents of God, as are you. Together we have accomplished much.

Beloved souls, may you continue to grow in the Father's Love. Expand, expand in this Love. The consciousness of the soul taking form and coming to the forefront of your awareness, the beauty of God's Love bringing the upliftment and the joy within you, the awakening that comes in His Love, all these things we wish for you. We wish that it continues and intensifies and so it will, beloved brethren. So it will.

I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to acknowledge you, to pray with you and to encourage you upon this path of service and love for humanity. May there be many blessings in store for you in the next leg of your trip. We will be close. Each one, no matter what direction they go, we will be close. God bless you, beloved souls. I love you and I am with you. God bless you.
