# Your Soul Condition

June 9<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Gibsons Prayer Circle, Nashville, TN, USA

Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, Judas, your brother and friend.

Brothers and sisters, you who come to be in the love of God, taking the time to remove yourself from the world, even if only for this circle, have recognized the desires of your souls to be at one, to be free in God. You have been told many times that the soul survives the death of the physical body and takes its place in a realm, in a sphere according to its condition. The beautiful sister (Maureen Cardoso) who has come up with a teaching, a healing, which she calls “Befriending Your Soul,” has done a great work in making you conscious of the soul’s existence and that you are, in fact, your soul. You are praying from your soul. Imagine, for a moment, if you will, that in this moment, you have crossed over into spirit with the condition of your soul, with its joy or its sorrow, with its light or its darkness, and of course, for most, this is a mixed bag, as you say.

If you connect each day in your prayers to God’s love, and you truly feel it empowering your entire being, lifted in love, weightless in the world, such a joy to have the weight of the world lifted off your shoulders, if even for a moment. *“Ahhh,”* you say, *“I am free”*. But then living in a world where so many have no consciousness of soul, you might even be reminded of the words of the Master, *What profit a man who gains the whole world and loses his soul?* That is the way of the world. And though you cannot truly lose your soul because you are your soul, you can certainly lose consciousness of it, awareness of it, lost in the material world, material mind, acquiring, and maybe overwhelmed by its circumstances. And so, it is.

The world is busy trying to overcome itself, but generally through misguided means. When one stumbles, it is wise to go to God and yet, creatures of habit, as you are, you may try and eat your way through a problem, you may medicate your way through a problem, or drink at it, or be enamored by the ways of the flesh, or simply material means. This is all around you. You need not be a genius to see what the world is up to. And so, in many cultures, those who choose spiritual life and wish to be free and transformed they go on a pilgrimage, and they often would fast as the Master did. The benefits of that being when one separates oneself from the usual habits that often do not promote healing, progression, happiness, but simply are like comfort food, giving one a temporary sense of well-being, a temporary separation from the knot in the heart, grief, anger, etcetera, you may wish to fast from one of your habits, just to see if it makes a difference. On the other hand, if your habit is to pray, I can’t encourage you to fast from that, and I would not. This group of bright souls certainly knows what I mean.

So, examine your soul in this moment. Feel its condition. Open your heart, relax your mind and its troubles, and as you go to God, your soul wishing to connect with the great soul of the Creator, your deep desire to be free, God blesses you. Being in this circle, this holy communion of souls, is such a blessing. Make use of it whenever you can and when you are alone, bring your soul consciousness back into this circle, knowing that you are at-one with others around in spirit, in the longing to be at-one in connecting to the soul of God. It is so simple, and yet it seems so difficult.

Ask yourself, what is it that I wish? What condition do I want my soul to be in while on earth and crossing into spirit? Aside from the great truth that the love of God transforms the soul, the great truth of prayer, remembrance, and living from your soul is the next very best thing.

May the love of God and His holy presence come into this circle and bless you. I thank you. I am your brother in Christ and your celestial friend in eternity.

I am Judas. God bless you.
