# Faith Must Carry You

September 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Matthew received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Matthew.

A child is born in faith. That faith allows the child to trust its parents for its nurturance and well-being. Within the soul of that child is a surety that it will be loved and cared for. When that child grows into a man or a woman, they may shift that faith and trust toward God. For God is there to uphold and nurture His children. Thus, faith is a great and beautiful attribute of the soul that desires to walk in harmony with its destiny, its life expressed in light and harmony. When you put your faith in God, you are saying and affirming that in the life that God has given you, He provides all that you require to have a life of harmony and light.

Yet, few understand this. Few walk in faith. Some are fortunate, like our dear brother, to find the way toward allowing faith to carry him in life. It is the same for you, my beloved brothers and sisters. Faith must carry you. Faith must guide you. Faith must strengthen you. For when faith is strong within, your guidance is clear and your journey is directed toward that which is meant for you, that road that God has designated for you. When you trust in God's guidance, God's Hand on you, then there are no true missteps. Yes, there are lessons on the road. Yes, there are obstructions. Yet, with faith, you overcome these things and you learn your lessons well.

You must realise that to apply faith to your life is to affirm that you are truly a child of God. When faith becomes the cornerstone of your life, and this I mean that when you pray to receive the great gift of God's Love, an act of faith in itself, then you are ascribing toward that which is of light, that which is of harmony, that which is of God. When you seek to empower yourself and walk that road alone, then you are vulnerable to the many pitfalls that come with this. Faith upholds you. Faith brings you wisdom. Faith brings you guidance and faith brings you blessings.

When these things come to you in abundance, what better life can be lived than this? Yet, it is all because you allowed yourself to trust in God, to walk that road with God and to be free from the pressures and the insistence of the human condition that often drives you along a road that is barren in joy, in truth and light. You must teach the value and power of faith to carry you upon that road of life, to be true to your soul's desires, which are to be with God and to allow the inner workings of your soul to bring to you the truth, the perceptions, the knowledge, the guidance that will carry you on the road of light, harmony and peace.

Faith will open the door to this. Each time you pray and ask for the blessings of God, you exercise your faith. As you receive more of these blessings, so your faith grows and that strength within brings you to a place where you are with God in such a way that it is immovable, that cannot be taken from you. That is a strength, capacity and tenacity that builds with faith, that builds as you grow in Love. Be a child of God. As you make those decisions in your life, as you act on faith, you become an example for others and you are a teacher of truth. My beloved, beautiful brothers and sisters, we have faith in our lives and faith carries us in our lives. Be of good faith, beloved, beautiful souls. Be with God, as God will carry you forward.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Matthew. My love is with you and I walk with you, for I too have faith. I have faith in you and your journey in light. God bless you.
