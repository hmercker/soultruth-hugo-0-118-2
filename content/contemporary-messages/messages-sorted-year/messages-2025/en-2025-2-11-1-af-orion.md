# Come to Know God’s Love for You

Orion received by Al Fike

May you come to know the wonderment of our Creator's blessing upon you, the power of Love that is a cohesive factor of the universe, the blessings of peace that are given to all of humanity. These things, when you know them in their fullness, in their beauty and in their glory, will go a long way to help you in your faith and your understanding of what it is we wish to convey to you.

I am your friend, Orion. I come once again to uphold my brothers and sisters, to help you find your way in a world that is so contrary to this way. Understand that you are children of God. There is no other way for humanity, no matter where they are situated in this universe. There is only the way to God, to understand this way, to acknowledge it and to fulfil it.

As you seek the great gift of the Essence of the Creator of all, then you will find your way. You will know your journey, your path. It does not come in a great revelation, my friends. It comes in the drop by drop, day by day realisation that God is with you. As you make your efforts to be with God, so you understand. So the dawning of awareness blooms within you. So you come to know who you truly are and how you stand with God, your Creator.

When these things come, when you come to know yourself in the richness and fullness of soul, then all that we have shared with you, all that your angel friends have shared, all that has been blessed toward you and upon you, within you, becomes clear and real, palpable and powerful. Yet, until you are able to put aside your mindful considerations, your detailed thoughts and constructs of what you call reality, these revelations are distant. Even though they are truly a part of you and they reside within you, you cannot know them by finding and realising the processes of your material mind.

The soul mind must come to the fore. This you have heard countless times. Indeed, you try. You try to sidestep the predominance of the intellect and the mind, but often you cannot help yourself. The mind has too much control. You give it that control. You live that control. You express that control in everything that you do, even in prayer. There must come a time when you let that control go, when you ease yourself into the beautiful, peaceful, serene blessings of God.

When you do this, and I know you have done it at times, but when you do this consistently, then you have conquered the human condition that resides within you. So, we are with you to help, to uphold, to reinforce, to teach, to bring our influence to bear upon you, and to walk with you for a time in your day. We see incremental progress. We see light growing. We see your soul thriving. Do you see this within yourself? If you do, then I congratulate you. I honour you, for with this recognition, you are well on the road to freedom. Yet, often, you are unable to recognise, you do not feel free and you are constricted by the processes and habits of the mind.

We have great compassion for you, beloved friends. We know how difficult this is for you. We are often amazed how you might overcome these things, for the odds, as you would say, are stacked against you. The conditions are so predominant in your world that it is difficult to overcome these things. It is an incredible task, huge in scope, to overcome the conditions in which you are immersed. That is what we call the human condition.

Yet, you struggle and try. You reap the rewards, small, incremental rewards, flashes of insight and understanding that come to you. Revelations that come and go, that seem so clear when they are in your soul consciousness and you are aware of them, yet you lose them so readily as the mind regains control and you are present in this particular condition of mind. Again, you seek out the revelations, the sense of God, understanding and acknowledging His Love for you, seeing for yourself, in the recognition, the understanding and the feeling of God's Love for you. Though this is feeble in comparison to what it truly is, it is indeed a respite from the judgments and conditions that are so often a part of your life.

Come to know the freedom, beloved friends. Come to know the Light and the revelation of God's Love for you. All the rest will follow. All the rest that is not of love, as our dear brother has prayed for, will melt and fall away. It is the truth revealed and expressed within you. You will come to that place. You will know that place. You will return to that place again and again, until it is truly a part of your daily understanding and knowing in the world.

We continue, beloved souls, upon this journey. Know that we are with you. God is with you. All that is of light is with you. For you try and you try so hard to be there, to be in the grace of God. This, in our perception, warrants great appreciation and honouring of these efforts. It is difficult, but not impossible. So, we journey forward, beautiful souls, seeking truth, seeking to live truth and to be truth.

God bless you. I am Orion and I love you so. My dear, dear friends, I love you so. God bless you.
