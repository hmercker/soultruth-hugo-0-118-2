# Your Souls Led You to God's Divine Love

June 9<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Peter received by Elizabeth Mack

The Father's Love is not apparent to everyone, but you and several others upon this Earth have found your way to God's Love. I am your brother, Peter. I live in the Celestial Heavens with many of my brothers and sisters, some of whom you are familiar with.

It is such a blessing that you chose. You made choices that brought you to the Father. Perhaps you were aware of the choices or perhaps you were not aware. But your soul's longings and desires were strong and your soul led you to find God's Divine Love. Here you are now, ready to serve, ready to proclaim the truth to all who care to listen, that God's Love is available for everyone, that God is One and only One and seeks to be at one with you in this Love.

Yes, you are special upon this Earth. For not only do you have this gift in your souls, but you are aware of it and aware of how to receive it. You are few among mankind. Now you go out and teach. Show them what it means to be a loving soul upon this Earth. Tell them the truth that, yes, there is a God. Yes, there is only one God and that God loves each and every one of His children and has a blessing far beyond their imaginations, just waiting for His children to ask for it. Now is the time. You are the souls and we will be with you. We are always with you. We are brothers and sisters in this Love. We protect you. We hold you close and comfort you. We help you in each step to see the truth.

May God bless you. We walk with you. We shall never leave you. As you do your work upon this Earth, we are right beside you. My love is with you. I am your brother. I am Peter. Many of us are here to uplift you, to pray with you and to love you. May God bless you, you beautiful souls. My love is with you. God bless you.
