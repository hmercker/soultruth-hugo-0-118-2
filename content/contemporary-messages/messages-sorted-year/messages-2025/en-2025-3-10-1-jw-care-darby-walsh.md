It is I, Care.

My dear ones, let us rest from the world for a moment or two. Let us feel the freedom. Let us feel the love of God and His holy presence in this circle. In the world, there is apparently much diversity and, at the same time, a connecting magnetism, and the vibrations of each soul. Creatures of habit. I, too, had my habits, my structures, and, as I have remarked, my deep longing to be free of encumbrances, especially negative ones, to be free with my children, with my beloved, with my friends. This became paramount for me, and so my habit became prayer. This increased, one could say exponentially, over a period of time, and do you know, the strange thing about it is that at first, I didn’t see how each prayer connected me with a higher vibration until I began to feel a light in my being and the emanations of love pouring down into my soul. I began to see that prayer could be brought into anything, any activity. It was not just removing yourself, although I did at times and often in nature, but being soulful in my actions, to be thanking God in the moment, and feeling the grace that comes into the soul longing to be at one with its Creator. In that condition, the celestial angels would guide me in ways I could not explain, and yet when I look back on the many miracles, big and small, sometimes recounted by my beloved, when I look back on those miraculous events, I can see it was simply a matter of being in prayer, being in grace and allowing the blessings, the interventions, the healings, the protection that was received.

One may wonder, if this was the case, how could I have met my end so abruptly in a way that seems very unprotected, causing the death of four people in that event? And for those who may question my passing over, I remind you that I had seen it, I had foreseen this event, and I had mentioned it more than once to my beloved, who did not wish to believe it. And who would? And yet, the passing over of the four souls into spirit precipitated great blessings, blessings beyond the grief, beyond the trauma, blessings that continue to this day on the loved ones’ families and friends. So, I wish to point out two things. Events that seem nefarious can often prove to be harmonious, and secondly, when one is in prayer and looking back, perhaps in a moment of grace, one can see the graciousness of God and how many times the angels intervened for one’s safety and the protection of those we love.

As your lives become more prayerful in the midst of a world often in denial, you create a light; you create the magnetism of Divine Love as in this circle. Each one who opens up feels the blessing. This is not a matter of having to give up the things that you need. If you bring prayer into your habits, if you bring the consciousness of your relationship to your Creator, everything changes. Your eyes truly begin to see as you walk in grace. Extending your arms to all, opening your heart to a world so in need, while God lifts you up and awakens you upon the earth. How blessed is that?

So, it may be helpful to keep a song in your heart. Hum if you feel that you don’t wish to sing. Hum the vibrations of love. Speak the vibrations of love. Live in grace. I wish this for all, and I shall step back to be in grace with you. I love you. I am Care. May God’s love be with you and bless you.
