Orion received by Al Fike

May there be peace amongst you, my friends. I am Orion. May Love shine in your souls. For this is the great gift given to all in the universe, the gift of the Essence of God's Soul to all the lights, all the beautiful creatures who possess a soul in this universe of ours. May you continue to grow in that Light, awakening to soul, truly understanding the gifts and abilities and the power of soul that is ignited by that great gift of Love.

How truly fortunate you are, my brothers and sisters, to know this gift as you do, for many in your world do not. They may have a sense of it, they may have an isolated experience of it, but to know it the way you know it empowers you to grow in this Love in a way that will lead you along the path of soul awakening and growth, your progress quickened by truth, your choices informed by truth and your motives informed by truth. The empowerment of both your mind and your soul in truth will continue to propel you along a path toward greater light and assist you to achieve your goals, to find your way along that path of service to humanity.

When the soul has wisdom and is receptive to divine guidance, then there is no telling where that path may lead or how beautiful may be the outcomes. You are exploring the potentials of your soul, coming to understand its abilities, coming to know the gifts as they open one by one within you, igniting a journey that will last forever, but also awakening potentials that most human beings have no idea exist. These potentials are what make my civilisation and others in the universe successful and capable in many ways, ways far beyond yours.

What is the lubricant of this success? What brings the fluidity of movement, experience and joy, knowledge and all good things of the universe of God's creation? It is Love, the Divine Essence of God. You must seek it, my friends, with great earnestness. You have been told this countless times, but it needs repeating many more. For without your focus upon the growth of the soul and without opening yourselves to that which stimulates its growth, then you become like most humans, living in a mediocre world, experiencing a very mediocre life. Yet, you want for yourself something extraordinary, something that will uplift and carry you forward, not only in this material life but in the spirit life as well.

You have chosen well to take this path toward at-onement with God. I urge you. It is far more important to spend your time seeking this gift of Love than it is in all the readings and the research, all the material knowledge that you may claim to know and accumulate, than it is to be in the great gift of God's Love. This is the focus. This is what is important. Often you of Earth put the cart before the horse, as you would say, piling great knowledge into the mind and neglecting the soul altogether. Yet, it must be the reverse, for when the soul is awakened the ability to know truth and knowledge is also awakened. You will find yourself with a deep sense of the workings of the universe, of the laws of the universe and the workings of your inner universe and what pertains to this.

My beloved friends, continue in your efforts to seek truth, what comes through your prayers and efforts to be in alignment, to be close to God. In that closeness comes an awareness of the soul. In that awareness of the soul comes the harmony and balance required to live a good life, a life filled with light. Indeed, a soul yearning for God, to receive the Essence, is a soul that is alive and is living its purpose. These fundamental truths you know and you know them well, but I urge you and remind you often of what is important, what are the priorities, what is necessary in order to truly manifest and in order to truly realise your potentials. It is not the mind. The mind is a minuscule instrument compared to the abilities of the soul, soul consciousness and soul mind.

The ability for the soul mind to expand and to absorb truth and to be in greater light and to express great love is what is required. When you can be in that state of soul consciousness, when you can truly explore and experience it and be with God in that oneness that is so beautiful and glorious, then you will have truly achieved something on this Earth. What you have achieved will be a gift to the Earth, an expression of light in the Earth, a beautiful example of where each individual soul must go in order to truly be alive and awake. My beautiful friends, seek out God's Love. Seek out the Consciousness of God with the consciousness of your soul and you will find that life will bedazzle you with all its glory and wonderment.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion and I love you dearly as we walk this path together with you and your many friends. Your Celestial friends are my friends. We are together in this effort to bring the truth to humanity. God bless you in the great power of Love, the Essence of God. God bless you.
