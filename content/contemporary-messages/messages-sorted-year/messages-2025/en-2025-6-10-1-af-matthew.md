Matthew received by Al Fike

My beloved friends, I am Matthew. I come to speak about compassion and how important having compassion is in your daily life.

With love comes compassion. It is the outpouring of love, that outpouring that embraces, accepts and nurtures another or yourself. As you come to know God, you come to know the intensity and power of God's compassion toward you, lacking judgement of any kind and expressing light that heals, uplifts and brings that sense that all is well and that you, as God's child, are known, accepted and embraced in love.

As God embraces you, it is important that you express that love toward others, for as you do so, the flow of Love continues to grow. The beautiful Light that is God's Love not only surrounds you but flows through you toward others. God utilises your beautiful soul, your light, as an instrument of Love and compassion toward others. Allow that flow to be unrestricted. As you cultivate compassion within your heart, your mind and your soul, so the Love may flow unrestricted and you, beloved and beautiful children of God, can see that every brother and sister is a child of God.

As you see and recognise this to be true, so you express a desire to embrace with compassion all your brothers and sisters, no matter their condition, no matter those things that you may in your mind feel difficult or repulsive, or that you wish to judge another. In your soul, there is compassion. Indeed, as you direct your thoughts and your expression toward the highest goal, which is of the soul, so compassion flows and the judgements dissipate. Allow yourself the luxury and the joy that comes when you release those conditions that are not of love and enhance those that are, so that you may be a light in the world, a light that says, *“I love you, I accept you, I embrace you, because you are my brother and you are my sister,”* and that all peoples of the world are interconnected and a part of this great family that God has created, His children inhabiting every corner of the world.

Indeed, with the diversity and expressions that come through all of these souls, there is a richness in the fabric of creation. As you can appreciate that richness, as you can examine that fabric of creation and the expressions of your brothers and sisters, then you cultivate and express love and appreciation. This is an example of compassion. There are many other ways you might be compassionate toward yourself and toward another, but they all have their roots in love. When love is expressed, love is felt, love is acknowledged, love is expansive and, indeed, an expression of the great gift of God's Love that resides within your soul, then you can only be compassionate toward another, for when you are true to this Love and this light within, compassion must come as an expression of your being.

Have compassion for yourself, for those flaws and parts of you that are not in harmony with God's creation. It is important that you are compassionate. In that compassion is the resilience and faith that you will, in time, release these conditions and adopt the great healing Love of God that will replace these conditions. It is a process. It takes time, but it is ongoing. God will not forsake you, my beloveds. God is always there in His compassionate self to uplift you and uphold you. When you stray, God does not judge or restrict. God is ever willing to embrace you once more.

The world that is an expression of compassion is a world that seeks harmony, that seeks light and that seeks to expunge the darkness that is the human condition. When you are loving toward another, you are expressing an act of defiance against the darkness and against those who are in a condition that causes pain. When you are compassionate toward those who are in the darkness, you are helping to dissipate those conditions. You are an instrument for God to bring healing, upliftment and peace. Be that compassionate soul, be that light, be that instrument of peace and may the Love flow through into you and through you, so that you are truly in alignment with the great flow of God's Love and the compassion that comes with that Love.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Matthew. I urge you forward in the light. I am with you as you struggle and as you learn the art and beauty of compassion, grace and loving expression. God bless you, beloved souls. The Light of God is upon you. Open your souls wide and receive this gift. You will know the power of God's compassion for you. God bless you, beloveds. Matthew loves you. God bless you.
