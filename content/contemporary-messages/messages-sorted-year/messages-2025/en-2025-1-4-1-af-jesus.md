# Deepest Blessing for the New Year

January 4<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May the blessings of the Father's Love be with you, my beloveds. I come. I am Jesus, your brother and your friend. I come to be with you to commemorate the beginning of another of your earthly years. I come to encourage and acknowledge you. I come to love you, to be with you in these prayers. For as you dedicate yourselves in a deeper way toward God's Will and God's Love, you forge a deeper connection with your Celestial friends, stellar friends and bright spirits.

All come together for the express purpose of bringing greater light to the world, to help to uplift humanity beyond the conditions that bring so many away from God, away from harmony and away from the laws of their creation. For as the mind continues to be engaged so fully in the chatter and irrelevancy of human thought and speculation, so the soul is buried underneath these disparaging conditions, the soul neglected, the soul alone, the soul unrealised in its potentials and abilities to bring harmony to the individual and thus contributing to bringing harmony to the world.

Your service, my beloveds, is to help others detach from this clutter of thought and come to the clarity of soul through prayer, through their capacities to be with God and to know God's Love for them. This is a formidable task. It requires deep dedication from you, deep prayers and desires from you. So, at the dawning of a new year, I come to encourage you to deepen and strengthen your commitment to God, your commitment to truth and your commitment to love. For without this foundation, all that you do, all the work that you speculate upon and endeavour to make real in this world of yours, will not have its desired effects. Without true dedication of the heart and soul to God, many of your ramblings, speculations and attempts to clarify truth will be lost within the clutter of human thought and endeavour.

Yet, if you are truly dedicated, my beloved and beautiful friends, then there is something more powerful, something different, that will come through you and from you to others. Your great challenge is to have that clear passage of truth and light expressed through your beautiful souls and your beautiful beings. Rather than being caught up in the clutter of human thought, you may be detached. You may walk upon the road of life, the road less travelled and be that light, that clarity, that strength, that dedication of soul, truly in love with God.

When you can do this and do it with ease, as your soul reflects its true longing and desire to be with God, then you become the teachers and the healers demonstrating the truth as you so long to do. Indeed, many blessings will manifest through you and many manifestations will affirm with others that you are truly an instrument of God's Will and God's Truth. It is for you in this coming year to continue in your dedications and preparations, for the time indeed does grow short.

This time that you have, without all the chaos and disruptions that are coming, is precious indeed. So, I urge you to use that time with wisdom, with fortitude, with faith and desire to be with God, to commune with your Heavenly Father and dedicate yourselves to the truth and teachings that come through your dedications, through your own instrumentalities and through the instrumentalities of others. Much is being given. You are being uplifted. You are in the light, and you will know the truth more clearly as you continue upon this path.

My beloveds, how precious you are to me and to all the Celestial Kingdom, to be upon this road seeking truth clear and true. It is time to truly step forward in your efforts to be with God, to truly be in alignment soul to soul with your Creator and to allow all the material conditions, the material mind and all the ambitions and efforts of that mind to be subjugated by the power and wisdom of the soul. For in this love of the soul, the wisdom and abilities that are inherent within will be manifest. The mind will understand in time why it is not the leader in your life, why it cannot truly take precedence in your life. For you come, each one of you, you come to demonstrate a different way of being, a different way of living, a different way where guidance from God is given freely, listened to and enacted with love, trust and faith.

It is time for you to reverse the trend of a lifetime of listening to the mind and having faith in that mind as having the knowledge and wisdom that you require. Instead, this is a quiet rebellion against this so-called wisdom. Indeed, the mind does carry certain wisdom, certain understanding of the material ways and means to be in the world, but this is not your focus, my beloveds. Your focus is to be upon the soul, the soul's desires and the soul's abilities to be that light, that channel of love and truth, to be that humble and yet powerful being filled with grace, filled with joy and filled with all it is of the divine.

I know this is a great challenge for you, each one of you, for you continue to step forward each day into your life with your mind well in control, deciding and anticipating as you live, moment by moment. Yet, we bring you all the truth, all the richness of a soul realised and awakened. What that can bring, what that can do and you have known in your own life how this may manifest. There are moments of clarity, moments of strength, moments of wonderment and moments of joy.

This awaits you, my beloveds. If you can overcome the schism of this contradiction of mind and soul, then you will manifest all that you desire to be as God's channels of love in the world. You know that we are with you. You know that I am with you. I pray for you so very often. I ask God to bless you, as do many angels. We are dedicated to your success, and we shall continue to be engaged in this dedicated effort to bring you to the truth fully, with great awareness and great joy and love.

It is for you to acknowledge the yearnings of your soul. It is for you to become aware of that which holds you from that yearning. It is for you to challenge your own self and patterns and ways of being in the world that are contrary to the truth you know. It is for you to seek out God's help and blessings to strengthen and bring to you the capacities to overcome these challenges, challenges that most in your world are not even aware of nor could they be strong enough to overcome them.

Without the efforts of your soul's longings and prayers and the longings and prayers of many around you, this blessing has brought you what you require and will continue to do so. My beloveds, you are truly blessed. We wait in anticipation for your daily choices and efforts to bring about the transformation of consciousness within you and, in this way, bringing your efforts, your daily choices, into alignment with God and all that God wishes for you in your life. God wishes of you in your life to be His beautiful channels of love, dedicated, strong and filled with grace.

My beloveds, I am with you. I shall not leave you. Will you be with God, never to leave Him, never to forsake Him, for the ambitions and illusions of a mind filled with so many distractions and irrelevancies? Be that child of God, humble, innocent and filled with joy. In this, you begin the journey of service. The dedications of the soul that you are longing to be with God, to serve God and to serve humanity start with a single prayer, humble and true.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus and I come to you with all earnestness and desire that you may overcome the restrictions and the barriers that keep you from God. God bless you, my beloveds. My love and prayers are with you always. I love you so. I love you so, each one in all their beauty and uniqueness, all their light and all their potentials to be God's loyal servants of truth. God bless you, my beloveds. God bless you. The angels are close. God bless you.
