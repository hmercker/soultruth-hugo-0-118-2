James received by Elisabeth Mack

Blessings from above, true children of God, blessings for each one of your souls from the Father. I am your brother, James. I once lived upon the Earth and surrendered myself to follow the Master and to find my way to the Celestial Heavens and there is no better way, no better path, no greater plan for oneâ€™s life as many of you have found out.

I come today with many, many others to not only uplift you, not only love you, not only to encourage you but to bring you blessings from our Father. There comes with me many who even now are touching your souls with the grace that God has given to them to express to you. This, because of your journeys upon the Earth, are arduous and you must see and know that there is better, much better and that you may feel it and know that this is part of the blessings that God has for you today and more so, into the future.

We attribute this blessing to your need to know and develop your faith in each step that you are taking. So my brothers and sisters, step into that place, than condition where you may learn of and come to know the truth of the blessing that the Father has for you today and know that there is much more to come with your prayers, with your service, with your love development.  I am James and I am humbled to be here today to bring you these blessings. May our Father open your souls and May you receive all that He has to give to you and may you be joyful along this path. God bless you. May God bless you greatly.
