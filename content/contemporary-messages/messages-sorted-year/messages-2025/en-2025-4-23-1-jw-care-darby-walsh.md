Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear ones, it is I, Care, your sister in Christ.

In these times of great change upon the earth, you find yourselves needing to be in prayer, needing the healing balm of the Father’s love, needing to be lifted up above your fears, your worries. Life, at times, can seem overwhelming; the things that arise, requiring your response, may sometimes seem like an endless cycle of obstacles, challenges, and perhaps insurmountable adversarial objects. So, you pray and you ask God for the gift of His love, to heal your heart, to free your mind, and to be in that state of oneness on a path that has no ending, unlike the events on earth. For, no matter how many times things recur, there is an ending which brings you into spirit, into freedom. Once you pass over and you feel the light and love in your new home, you will wonder how you ever feared your passing. From a world that is a blink of an eye into a world full of glory and surprises, and on the path of Divine Love, never-ending joy and bliss.

As you are moved here on Earth with the love in your souls to lift others up, so you will find yourself on this side also with deep empathy for those who are struggling in darkness. For a heart that is opened in love and most especially in the love of God cannot help but to serve others, and that is a part of the great joy and the celebration of each moment in God’s love.

So do not fear, for you are firmly on the path that leads to the celestial kingdom, and you have so many guides and have been given a plethora of truths. As you activate with your soul what you have learned it becomes more and more a part of your being, and even I, a simple pilgrim on Earth, began to feel this with the entirety of my being, the love of God, and what a wonderful thing it is to be filled with it.

I thank you for this time, and I remind you that you are blessed in the embrace of God’s great love. Be in joy, be in peace, and know I love you. I am Care.
