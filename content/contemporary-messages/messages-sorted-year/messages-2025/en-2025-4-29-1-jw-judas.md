# Sow the seeds of Truth to the World without concern

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother, Judas. I also wish to talk about this subject so dear to all of you about bringing the truths of God’s love and the gospel of the Master to the world and I remind you, those of you who know of the parable of the Master of the seeds, where some fall on the rocks, some are washed away, and some fall on fertile ground. So, as you go out into the world, in the fearlessness of God’s grace and speak the truth, you may come up with great resistance, as some of you have. You may find that some people cannot deconstruct their erroneous beliefs, and some may actively challenge you and yet there are always some who will hear, always some who will be open, receptive, and grateful that you have brought them something they had long wished for, their souls wanting, and you brought them the truth.

So, as the dear sister said, you need not be concerned where the seeds you plant fall, for those that fall upon fertile ground will grow in the grace of God and bloom with the fragrance of the celestial kingdom. As always, we encourage you, each one, to go deep, to open up your heart that God may open up your souls, that you may walk in grace and in His will, aligned with your own in oneness. Let this be your gift to the world.

It is no accident that we have brought you together for these days, for each one will receive the gifts that they are intended to receive, that they may progress, that as a group, you may coalesce in the oneness of our Father’s great love, a great light in the darkness and a healing balm for the wounds upon the earth.

Our blessings in the Father’s love to all. I am your brother and friend in the celestial kingdom.

I am Judas.
