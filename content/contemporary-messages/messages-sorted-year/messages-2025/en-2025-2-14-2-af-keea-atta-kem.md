Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

I come, too. I am Keea Atta Kem. I come in love. I acknowledge love. I bring my love for you.

May each one of you know that you are loved, loved dearly by God, loved dearly by the Celestial angels who inhabit the Celestial Kingdom, loved dearly by your loved ones, loved dearly by the bright spirits and all who espouse love, who are with you and express love toward you.

So, we are basking in the Light of God's Love, in the light of the love of those who love you, in the light that is pure and beautiful, a blessing to all. God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love each one of you. God bless you, beloved souls.
