# Guidance is given in Faith

June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Florida Retreat, Inverness, FL, USA

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother, Yogananda.

I welcome you to this circle, this Divine Love prayer, this Divine Love yoga. As you relax your body and find the stillness in your mind and go into the depth of your soul, to be at one with the Great Soul of our loving Creator, all that is required is the deep desire. For Godâ€™s love is already the case, waiting for your call.

When you open up the ears of your soul, you can begin to hear the guidance that is not always with words but is always clear. When you feel you are being guided and you are feeling the love of God simultaneously, I encourage you to proceed. It does not matter if you have formulated a specific plan or perhaps are concerned that you have not, for often, these considerations that the material mind finds so necessary are actually not helpful, sometimes even blocking the way. The expression, overthinking, describes kind of what I wish to say. For, if you could think your way to enlightenment, if you could think your way to healing, you might get halfway there. Much of what is our assistance is given when you are in a state of allowing, a state of faith. Trust that we may help create the circumstances you so desire. And, as you may know, there are many progressive and wonderful spirits who assist in material matters, and when this is in harmony, it is a very good thing. For we assist in matters of the soul, just as the Creator assists in bringing the love into your souls and the presence, the Holy Presence, into your midst. And what you will find if you put this first, seeking the kingdom first, seeking at-onement, is that all those other needs fall into place. So, it is not a matter of pulling oneself up by their bootstraps, as they say, but being lifted up in love and allowing the perceptions of your souls to guide you.

This is also true when it comes to realizing your gifts. Each one here has gifts, utilizing them when guided. Some reluctantly, as my brother here knows, are uncertain of whether or not they should step forward. I can tell you this: that whenever you step forward in faith, when you step forward to serve, and when you are in a state of grace, it is a perfect thing, and you enter into the flow in harmony with the laws of God, and that in itself is a wonderful blessing.

You put it out there, you do the service. God will take care of the rest for you. Welcome all. Embrace friends and enemies alike. Feel the oneness of God in and through all beings. You can do no greater service for humanity than to walk in love, talk in love, sing in love, play in love, serve in love.

I thank you for this time, and along with so many here. I bring you my love and blessings in Christ. I am your brother and friend always.

I am Yogananda. Be at peace. Be at peace.
