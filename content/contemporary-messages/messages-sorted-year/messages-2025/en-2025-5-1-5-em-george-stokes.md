# Pleased With Our Progress

May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am George. I come to praise and honour the progress that has been made thus far in this phase of your development. By “your” development, I mean each and every one of you, seen and unseen. The Father's Love pours upon you. You are open, receiving and accepting. The next phase of receiving that Love is to express it and share it with your brothers and sisters.

This is your responsibility that our dear brothers spoke of earlier. Your responsibility is to respond in love to each soul who comes to you, regardless of how they appear to you, whether downtrodden or “saintly”, if you will. Your responsibility is to love that soul. You are ready. You are more ready than you realise to love your soul siblings. Come to know this and all else will come to you: those souls whom you can best help and the Love from the Father to share it with your brothers and sisters.

You know that we will be with you, for we love you, too. Such progress has been made! Such beautiful souls sit in this circle!  Such love is expressed among you! Take this love as you travel and share it. Express it, manifest it and bring harmony to this world.

May God bless you. I am your brother, George, and it has been a pleasure to be with you.
