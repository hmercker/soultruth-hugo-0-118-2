# Be a Channel of God's Love Wherever You Go

Barbara Davies received by Al Fike

I am Barbara. I love you all so dearly and I have great compassion for your struggles on this earthly plane, struggles that I had and everyone has had living in the material world. Now that I have passed into spirit, I see the world differently. I see my role as God's instrument differently than I did when on Earth.

I want to talk to you about this. There has been a lot of conversation and concern about doing God's Will in the world, how this is accomplished. Who will do what? Who will play the role of leader, who will play the role of healer, etc? What you must realise is that God's plan is vast and intricate. You are but one small part of this vast plan that God has for humanity. In this realisation, you might feel small, but I tell you that you are an equal player in a vast orchestra of light and love that is being played out in the world.

This brings one to humility and faith to trust in God's Will and to do so with every breath. This world is focused on achievement, on accumulation and on empowerment. These are all human concepts, concepts that are not in line with the soul. The soul is about being and loving, about the joy of life and the experience and expression of life. This cannot be calibrated by another. Only you know how engaged and how in harmony you are with life and with God's Will. When you are in harmony with God's Will, you feel joy. You feel content. You feel all is well in the world. When you are out of harmony with God's Will, there is a feeling of restlessness and discontentment.

How do you feel, my friends? How are you in the world at this moment? Do you feel that you are attuned to God and that your souls are singing in praises for our beloved God? When that joy and sense of belonging rises up within you, meeting God in that place, so sacred and so beautiful, and enjoining with God in the joy and in the acknowledgement that you are loved by God and your love for God is great, this is an achievement. This is what is most important. For when you are in that state with your heavenly Father and you are open to the great blessing of His Love, that you are in that place of readiness and receptivity, and when that Love flows in and does so readily and abundantly, you are ready to do the work. You are able to hear God's Will and you are able to enact that Will because you are empowered by Love.

These things cannot be measured by others. It is your own personal relationship with your Creator. This I had while on Earth. This I continue to have and realise that my greatest strength was my love for God and my relationship with my Creator. When this relationship is strong, then whatever I did in the world reflected this. It was the outpouring of love from me and through me, wherever I went. Whoever I met, whether it be some poor individual, lost and afraid, living in the bush with no food, no direction and only fear as his companion, or whether I met politicians or those high up in their hierarchy of the world, my love for them was the same. The feelings I had for them were the same. I could go anywhere in the world because my motivation was not to seek the approval of others, but to be that channel of love in the world.

When you are in that state of loving care for your brothers and sisters, seeing them as equals, seeing them as truly your brothers and sisters, then God can use you in many beautiful and powerful ways. This is an achievement. This I encourage each one of you to strive toward, to put aside the reflections of a mind that considers calibrating everything and rating those things in mental ways. Put this aside. It is not important. What is important is to be in the grace of God at this moment and every moment. That way God will utilise you in the most effective and powerful ways that can be done.

Of course, there are limitations of your development and your gifts and who you are and how you see the world. These things are always entering into your consciousness and your expression. Yet, what infuses and overshadows everything is the power of Godâ€™s Love. This transformative power changes your perspectives, your ambitions, your fears and your judgements. These things are transformed by Love and when Love transforms these things, then they no longer have power. They are no longer relevant to your life and you are able to release the human conditions that you carry and walk in the world as a pure and beautiful channel of God's Love.

My beloveds, my beautiful friends, my family, I know it is difficult to see this perspective and to understand how profound it is to be within the grace of God in this way, as you walk the Earth. Yet, you are surrounded by angels. You are given every blessing and every scrap of love, everything that you need is given to you abundantly, without judgment and without restriction. Allow yourself to be in the grace of God's Touch, to make this your ambition and your desire. Everything will come from this. All will fall into place with harmony and grace.

When grace is the predominant condition that you carry, God will guide you. God will show you the way. There is no second guessing. There is no speculation. There is merely faith, faith in the moment, as you are with your Creator and walk in the world in this condition of faith, in this condition of grace. Trust in God. Trust that your soul knows and that the consciousness of your soul will carry you everywhere and anywhere. Any condition, any situation, will be seen as a blessing. There will be no fear, nothing to hold you from engaging in the world as an instrument of God's Love.

I love you, my beloved and beautiful friends. I am with you often. My dear sister, I am with you often. My dear son and daughter, I am with you often. I see your progress, all of you. I see your progress. Your beautiful lights are shining forth and it brings me joy to know that in the beginning, we were all fledglings, seeking the truth, trying to understand and supporting one another in love. I see that time we spent in the supporting, loving efforts, in prayer and in conversations and in doing together, has brought about many blessings and has helped each of us to grow. God provided the environment and the conditions for us to do so. He is at this very moment bringing you all together to pray and converse together, to consider your own progression and those things that hold you back. These are important conversations, important times and precious times to be together. Do not waste them, but expedite what is offered and use them to the greatest and highest benefit.

God bless you, my friends. Barbara loves you dearly. God bless you.
