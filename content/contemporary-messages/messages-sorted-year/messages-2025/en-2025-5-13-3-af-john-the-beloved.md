John the Beloved received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls of truth. I am John, the apostle of Jesus. I come to be with you because my love for each one of you is great. For each one who challenges the status quo upon the Earth and carries the mantle of God's Love into the Earth wherever they go, they carry a light. They carry the possibility of being God's channels of Love. I honour you and I love you. I know that this world is harsh. It is blinded to the Truth of God's Love often. Yet, you persist, beloved souls. You persist upon the path. You are dedicated and loyal to this truth as you seek to expand your souls in God's blessings of His Essence.

Angels are with you. It would be easy for us to gather within the Celestial Heaven and ignore the troubles of Earth, for where we reside is great peace, harmony and beauty, where God's Love permeates and where we are in alignment with that Love. Yet, this is not our way, nor is it the way of God. We are all one, all humanity. We cannot ignore the plight of our brothers and sisters. We must continue to work, to labour diligently, to bring the Truth of God's Love to whomever will listen. In this, we do God's work. In this, we are blessed to have the opportunity to serve, to be God's agents of Love.

So are you, my beloved friends. For without you, it would be much more difficult for us to make a substantial rapport and presence upon the Earth. We rely upon you. We rely upon your prayers and your desires. We rely upon the light that you carry within your soul. There is so much in terms of our need of you, though I know you see it differently. You see your need for us, our love that we bring and our upliftment and ministrations for your benefit. This is true. We are there for you. Yet, we are not only there for you, but for many, many in the world. We utilise this bond, this connection, this Lattice of Light that grows in the world, in order to reach the many souls. Many are longing for love. Many are longing for God, but they are entrapped in ideas, antiquated structures and religions that restrict their experience and their understanding of God.

You have the understanding of the expansiveness of God's Love, this unrestricted Love, this Love that is available to you not only for the moment, but for all eternity. How blessed you are to know this truth, to not be shackled or encumbered by religious doctrine that holds you from God. No soul is truly held from God, but the minds of mortals act as a buffer, a filter, acting to restrict the experience. Yet, the soul continues to long. There are times when the soul's longings are answered by the gift of God's Love. These are the individuals, the seekers that we desire to minister to and to connect you with, so that they may know the truth and they may accept it. You are the examples, beloved souls, truly the examples of the effects of the Father's Love upon the soul. As you shine forth in the world, know that we are with you reinforcing that light, accompanying you wherever you go. Together, this force is formidable, beautiful and transformative.

We seek to serve together. We are together a formidable and beautiful instrumentality that God may use in many different ways and with many different blessings. Continue to pray for this great gift of Love, for this is the key. It is the key that unlocks the door that brings the truth, not only to you, but to many others. You serve God well, my beloved friends. You will continue to serve God in deeper, more powerful ways upon your world. We will establish a greater rapport and bond with each one of you as you grow in this Love, as that door opens, as the key is turned. My beloveds, know that we are with you, that we love you so. We love you so. We honour you and appreciate your dedications. Your love for God, combined with our love for God, brings the light to the world.

God bless you. I am John the Beloved. I love you, beautiful souls, seekers of truth. God bless you. God bless you.
