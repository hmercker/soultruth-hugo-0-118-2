John the Beloved & Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

So we thank you for your prayer. I am John, John the Beloved and I come to you in following my Master, Jesus, who is here and has been here giving you blessings, each and every one. Open completely, dear ones. Open that your souls may be filled with the Essence of our Creator who desires to bless each child, each soul, each living creature upon this Earth and this Mother Earth as well. Tell your Father, from your souls, what it is you desire. Tell your Father your souls’ deepest, strongest, most loving souls’ desires that He may bless you.

We are here to comfort you at every moment of your lives upon this Earth. You need only ask. We are here for you. We desire to help you. We desire to love you as our Father loves us and you. For love is all that is required of any soul and it is all that is within the universe. Come to know how this love can transform you, rebuild you, if you like, make you at one with the Creator, our loving Father, our Source of everything. Why not turn yourselves to the Creator and allow His blessings, all of the love that He has for you to bring you above these conditions currently in the Earth. Reside with Him. Reside with the love. Reside with the power that the love has to clean your souls, to embrace you, to uplift you.

**Jesus:** Open and allow this grace to touch your souls. I am with you always, always. I am the Master of the Celestial Heavens and I bring with me a retinue of Celestial Angels, souls transformed by this grace of God that my beloved brother, John, speaks of. You are worthy of the Creator’s great love. So open and allow His breadth to come into your souls. I bless you. My Father has sent me to do so. He blesses you and we are many here surrounding you and loving you. These moments are rare that we come this close and this many. So drink up. Drink up the love that is so very present.

May the Father wholly, totally, completely bless you with His love. I am Jesus and I and all of us here, love you with this precious sacred gift. May the Father bless you and may you be open eternally to receive.
