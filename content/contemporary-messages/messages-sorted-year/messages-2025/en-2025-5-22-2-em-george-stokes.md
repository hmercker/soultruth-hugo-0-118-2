# Share the Love That is Within Your Souls

May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

My dear child, many blessings upon each one of you in this circle. God pours out His gifts to His true children, whose souls are open, as are yours at this time. We come in support of your prayers. We come in support of all of your soul’s desires and longings to be at one with God, for this is the true path to the Father. We come to support you all.

I am George. When we look to see all the souls here, we know there is a great mission being accomplished upon the Earth to bring about this transformation that our Father has put into place for the souls upon this Earth. His Love is so great and so powerful that one would think, by His mere fiat, He could transform this world in an instant. Yet that Love, that gentle Love for each of His children, moves Him to wait until His children recognize the opportunities being presented to each one.

The depth of His Love is great and yet the understanding of the souls upon this Earth barely reach a minuscule amount that is needed to move these souls forward, to help them to grow in this Love and to change their ways. You, dear children, continue to serve the Father in your prayers for these children, in your interactions with your brothers and sisters and with your desire to love them, regardless of where they are in their journeys. Yes, eventually they will move forward, but it is God's Will that they do so upon the Earth plane for their greatest happiness. Yet, still, there are those who resist, those who are unaware and those who are so immersed in distractions and unloving behaviours that they seem all but untouchable.

Continue your prayers. Continue your outreaches. Continue to talk to people and, more importantly, to love them. Share this Love that is within your souls. Touch their souls, if not their minds, so that when they do pass over, they will come to an awareness that there is a Love available that is greater than anything, any distraction, any amount of passion that they have for things material. Love them and the Father will continue to bless you with His Love, to reinforce all that you know to be true.

May the Father's Love touch your souls deeply. May you stay wide open to receive the sacred gift. My love is with you. I am George Stokes. I will pray with you, as will many, many, many Celestial Angels.
