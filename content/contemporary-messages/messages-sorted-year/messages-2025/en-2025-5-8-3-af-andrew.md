Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Andrew received by Al Fike

I am Andrew. As the waves carry you home, may you consider the blessings that have been given. May you see how, when a group of earnest souls gather together, much can be accomplished and many blessings can flow.

As we have told you, you are bonded. You have this link to assist you in supporting one another in your continued travels and journeys of receiving the gift of God's Love and the resulting blessings that come with the continued progression of the soul that will manifest and be a part of your conscious self in so many ways and be a part of your instrumentality for God in so many ways. You have grown within your soul. You have come to recognise the perfect gifts that God has given you. You have come to find joy. You have come to find fellowship upon a journey that is often lonely and isolated. Yet, you have one another and you have others.

My beloved friends. Do you see how God provides for you? Do you see how one step, one effort that you make to affirm God's invitation, brings many blessings and many steps forward on the journey? You will come to see yourselves in the light that you have received and understand the depth of the designation that our beloved Master has given. In many ways, you will come to express and embrace the gifts that God has given to you in your soul. The continued unfolding, petal by petal, of this beautiful flower of the soul will surprise you in the intricacy and the beauty that lies within each one of you, each one unique, different. Yet, the exquisite beauty that is you will continue to unfold in your consciousness and be adored by your understanding and love for yourself.

The adoration is not one puffed up in pride, puffed up in ego. It is one that is a humble acknowledgement of the beauty that God has created within you. As you embrace this beauty and embrace yourself, you become strong, of light and of truth. In this way, God will use you as His instruments. Indeed, the flow and power of the gifts that He has given you will touch many others. You are blessed, beloveds, beyond measure, beyond measure. How beautiful you are in this Circle of Light, glowing, glowing as the soul responds and acknowledges its Heavenly Father and comes to this in joy.

May you continue to be blessed, beloveds. Continue to understand how truly, truly wonderful you are and truly wonderful is God. God bless you. I am Andrew, one of many who stand by you at this moment and will continue to stand by you with every breath you take. Until that breath is finished, you will have your angel friends close and you will have God nurturing you, not only up until the end but far beyond that into eternity. God bless you. Andrew loves you. God bless you.
