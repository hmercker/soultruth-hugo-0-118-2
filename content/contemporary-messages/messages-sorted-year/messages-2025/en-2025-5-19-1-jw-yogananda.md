Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear friends, precious souls. It is I, your brother, Yogananda.

Let us be at peace in the love of God. I wish to talk about living in peace in a turbulent world full of anxiety, so many in need. If you examine with your soul, in grace, the daily interactions of those around you in the world, the leaders of this world, so-called, you can see that much is a reaction to a fearful heart. There are a multitude of reasons in the mind to be afraid. You might be harmed, physically. You may lose your job. You may suffer the death of a loved one. You may be in a warzone, a refugee. You may simply be reading the news, and pick from the plethora of inharmonious things, of events in the world. The reaction of those who do not have a spiritual foundation, those who do not cling to God, is often simply to try and protect oneself physically as one would from a dangerous animal. This fight or flight response has come down from ancient times, and it can be very helpful when it prevents you from a mishap. But no amount of arming yourself, building walls, or creating armies will ever overcome a heart in fear. It will simply, mindfully inform it that it may be protected. At the core is fear of death.

You who communicate with us on the other side know, at least intellectually, if not soulfully, that there is no death, that the soul shall travel on, albeit in its current state of harmony or inharmony. And so, being wise my friends, you have chosen to come together in prayer, and I can tell you that as your soul becomes more immersed in the soul of God, obtaining His love, you build a foundation in light and grace that is beyond fear, for it is already living in harmony with one foot in paradise and the other in the world, but in the world with love.

So, as was stated earlier, you are a blessing in this world, and as you remain in love, in the presence of God, in grace, in the flow and harmony that comes with Divine Love, you become fearless, a being of light, a blessing of love. And if you could only give one thing to this world, let it be that, for Godâ€™s love has conquered death, overcome fear. Allow your hearts to relax. Allow your aspirations to become more and more constant, so that your life becomes one of prayer. Embrace all in this love. Support each other. Be a friend to the friendless. But, above all, embrace all in this Love Divine.

May your souls outshine this world and know the peace that comes in grace. I am your brother and friend in the love of God, one in Christ, and I thank you for this time, and I thank my brother for allowing me to visit. May God bless you all and may peace be upon you.

I am Yogananda.
