March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come, my brethren. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you and to be with you, to help you unlock the doors of the great inflowing of God's Love, the blessings of His Soul to your soul. I come because I love each and every one of you. I come because you are in need of me, the blessings of God and the ministrations of the angels upon you. We come all, in the great onrushing of Love.

May you open your souls wide, beloved souls, to receive this gift in abundance. God gives you this opportunity, this great blessing, freely, because God loves you. God brings to you all blessings that are possible, all blessings that shall flow without hindrance. The grace of God is yours. 
Blessed are the children who seek the highest Truth. Blessed are those who are willing to walk the path less travelled. Blessed are those who release the conditions and restrictions that hold them back from God. They are truly God's children. They are truly blessed by God's Hand.

My beloveds, we gather together to receive this Holy Communion, to come to our Heavenly Father in all earnestness, humility and desire to truly be God's children, to truly walk in the grace of God's Touch and to truly be a light in the world. For the world needs each and every one of you. Every soul who commits themselves to light, to truth and to love, is a precious gift to the world, for they carry the beginnings of a new world. They are the harbingers for what is to come. They are the blessed ones, the disciples of truth.

So we are, beloved souls, those of us in the world of spirit and those of you in the world of the flesh. We band together in this great effort to help transform this world, so degraded by error and darkness, into light and harmony. Are you with me, beloveds, in this great effort? Are you willing to go beyond the restrictions of your own doing and mindful projections and be freed by the awakening of your soul, to walk in that freedom and express yourself in that light, to truly be God's instruments in the world? Are you willing, beloveds, to follow me, that we may change the world, not by our own doing, but by allowing God to work through us to bring that change so needed and to bring that Love so desired?

Every soul thirsts for this Love, but it is our work to unlock that desire within the individual by showing them the way to truth. When you are that precious example, free from the inhibitions of the mind, then you become the instrument to help bring others to the Truth of God's Love.

Do not tarry upon the path, my beloveds, but run swiftly to God and seek earnestly these blessings. In this, you will find all that you desire, the fulfilment that is beyond any other fulfilment. The expansion of your soul and its transformation by the great gift of God's Love is yours to be had at this moment. Yearn, my beloveds. Seek this. Drink of these Waters like a thirsty man in the desert. It is limitless and you may have all that you desire. For God's Touch shall give to you the great gift, a great blessing known to the soul and desired by the soul.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom, and your brother and your friend. I shall pray with you and be with you for all eternity, my beloveds, all eternity. We are bonded, for we each have this gift. We shall continue to receive it for eternity. God bless you, beloveds. I love you. Each one, I love you.
