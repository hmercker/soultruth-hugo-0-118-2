Orion & Jesus received by Al Fike

**Orion:** May the peace that passes all understanding be yours, beloved friends. I come from far away. I am Orion. I come in response to your prayers and desires for peace on this Earth of yours. I come because I am an elder and my soul is filled with the great blessing of the Father's Love. In this, I am one of His instruments that have dedicated themselves to service for humanity here on Earth.

The world is in need of your prayers. God can heal the Earth, but God is dependent upon the prayers that you offer and the desires that you have. For God does not circumvent free will. God gives in accordance to your will and desire. Thus, humanity must recognise the power that they possess to change the world. In the past, humanity has brought change, but that change has not brought harmony because, in many regards, humanity does not engage God as a partner in change. Rather, humanity goes about their will and desires independently. God has allowed this because God has given free will to all souls upon this Earth.

Now it is time to gather the will of men, the will of all peoples, to seek peace and to seek harmony in the world. When they reach out to God, then that harmony is multiplied. These blessings are given in such abundance, but the floodgates are controlled by humanity. Humanity must apply themselves in prayer, in thought and in deed in order to bring peace and harmony to the world. The greatest boon to harmony is light and the greatest manifestation of light is the Essence of God, it is Divine Love. When these laws are applied and when each of you seeks out the Light that comes with Divine Love, then you are contributing to the healing of the world as you contribute to the healing of yourself.

There is so much that humanity does not know or understand. Most of you are engaged in mental journeys, perceptions and expressions until the soul is not recognised. It is left behind upon this journey. Yet, the soul is not only a vital part of your being, but it is the more powerful and knowledgeable part of your being. Just imagine if you engage the perceptions and faculties of your soul, what progress humanity could make. Humanity could join us and many others in the universe in that harmonious condition of love and mutual cooperation. We all turn our eyes to God. We seek the blessings of the Creator in all that we do. We are God's children, as are you. Yet, this understanding, so simple, so basic, is missing in your world to a great degree.

Yet we, and so many others, persist in assisting you in your development and your progress, in the evolution of your species and the progression of your world. You must, my beloved friends, lay the foundation and make it firm. We will help you build something magnificent. There are few of you, I know, but everything begins with a small gesture, a small effort. When that effort is consistent and full of faith and trust, then it will grow. When the Love of God is involved, it draws light and light draws those seeking light. It will be in your world, the beginnings of something magnificent, something that will shift the course of humanity irrevocably and permanently.

You are a part of this, beloved souls. We are a part of this. Your angel friends are a part of this. Beautiful bright spirits are a part of this. This great momentum is building and God brings what is required to shift humanity toward light. It is given freely, but it must be received and accepted freely. You must find your way upon the path and you must find your way toward God. When that partnership is sealed between you and God, then the power of your service, your capacity to bring light, bring truth and bring harmony to the world is multiplied, added to such a degree that you are truly, and will truly be, powerful instruments for change, light and harmony in the world.

Do not underestimate the power of your own soul, for you barely know your own soul. Yet, you will continue to find your way toward soul consciousness and soul recognition. As you seek this great gift of Love, so it will bring you to your soul and your soul to your consciousness in such a way that you will see the world differently. You will see yourself differently. You will see your relationship with your life, this world and all that is God's universe in such a way that truth, knowledge, wisdom, peace and a great capacity for love and compassion will be yours. This is what comes with the power of God's Love, the transformation that it brings, transformation that must come to your world. It is coming, ever so slowly, but the momentum builds as you grow and others grow and you band together in cooperation, in harmony, to support one another, to bring love to each other and to the world.

This is the key to the healing of the world, beloved and beautiful friends. It is not complicated. It does not require technologies and mental capacities, the way humanity has suggested to cure the problems of this world. It is misplaced direction. Humanity must go within and seek God from without. Humanity must grow in this way. In this growth, in what comes in this growth of the soul, the wisdom and ability to correct and solve the dilemmas of your age will be found and applied readily and effectively.

This is done in every world where God has placed souls, your brothers and sisters. Everyone is given a choice. In making the choices that are in harmony with creation, they have reaped the benefits, the blessings, the joy and the harmony. We wish for you the same, my beloved friends. We pray earnestly for your upliftment and your recognition of truth. Many, many forces in the universe at this time are exerting their capacity, their light, their prayers and their efforts to uphold you, for you are in a perilous condition. You have garnered great power, but have no wisdom in order to use it for good.

Thus, there must be a shift of consciousness, a shift of understanding, so the good that may come of your efforts and good may come of your lives, individually and collectively. Be loving to one another, my friends, for love is the glue that bonds you all together and the Divine Love is the power that fuels your love and your capacity to love. Continue on this road, for it is the right road. You will find as you progress, the wisdom will come, the knowledge will come and much will come from a soul that is alight with the Essence of God.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. My love for you is great. Be at peace and know that God has you in His hands, that you are cared for and loved, that you are not alone, but you are embraced by angels of light and all that is of light. It is yours, as God pours His Love upon you. God bless you. God bless you, beautiful souls, earnest seekers. God bless you.

**Jesus:** I come on the heels of my friend. I come to bring light to you all. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I am here. I endorse the words of our beloved friend. I endorse all words that are of truth. I urge you to take into your souls the truth and to be an instrument of truth, love and light.

Put aside all conditions that are contrary to this and be of good faith. Trust in God, for all good that is in the universe comes from our Creator, our beautiful Heavenly Father. Be with Him. Open to Him and seek the great gift of His Love. All shall come into harmony and peace and many blessings given.

God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you.
