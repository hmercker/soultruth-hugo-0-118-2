John the Beloved received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, your brother John.

I am the apostle and the one they call “The Beloved”. All here are beloved by God. All here in this prayer receive not only the great essence of the heavenly Father but His gifts of the Spirit. Each one is on a journey to discover how to bring their talents to the world. Perhaps you are engaged, whether with your work or some other form of social interaction with several people during the day. If you feel you cannot be in a place filled with peace and quiet, I recommend this simple action.

Each person you encounter, ask God to bless them with all your heart and from the depths of your souls. Every interaction that brings you into contact with another soul, whether it is physical, verbal, or just a greeting. When you ask God to bless another soul, you are giving gifts of the spirit; you are not proselytizing, you are not asking anyone to read a certain book or follow a particular discipline, join a church, or even inviting them to dinner.

This is your moment, and I tell you that this simple act of asking for a blessing for every soul you encounter brings you into that state of grace that you felt you could not achieve in the hustle and bustle of your day. I would also recommend to those who are maybe not socially active during the day or evening but feel they are disconnected, perhaps having trouble quieting the mind, getting into their soul longings, but truly wishing to feel the love of God, you can also focus on someone in mortal or spiritual life. It may be a person you are at odds with. It may be a friend, a family member, or someone you know who needs a healing. And from your space alone, again, go to God, and with all your heart, ask for a blessing for this soul. You may intellectually feel that this is an ineffective exercise, but in fact, what gets sent out from God and your soul is not only powerful, prayerful, and compassionate, but has real substance, greater than any material gift you could give. Consider that for a moment.

I will not add more tonight except to say thank you for allowing me to give you this encouragement. It felt needed, and I thank my brother as well, who is very tired this evening but willing to receive. May God bless you with a great inflowing of His love, heal you, sustain you, and transform you. I am your brother in Christ. I am John. Go in peace.
