# Love Above All Else

Orion received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, beloved souls. I am Orion. You sit in the luxury of this time in your earthly plane, where conditions in the material sense are not so severe or challenging, that your needs are easily met and that you traverse the world in ways that were unheard of by your ancestors.

You are replenished and resplendent in these material conditions because humanity has put its focus and efforts toward accomplishing these things in the material world. Yet, humanity lags far behind in spiritual development. Thus, the imbalances which we have spoken of so often continue to affect your world and everyone within it, whether it be the systems that sustain the world, the creatures that are upon the world, or the souls that inhabit this world. All is in disarray, not particularly because of the intentions of humanity in a conscious way, but because the trajectory of human endeavour and desire has brought the Earth, all the Earth, into this condition that is disharmonious.

These challenges are subtle. I believe that you each feel these challenges each day as you attempt to raise your condition above that of this earthly plane of yours. The spiritual energies, as you would describe them, are in disarray. The kinetic and magnetic energies of your Earth are in disarray. The true condition that this Earth is meant to be in is far from what it is at this time, on many different levels.

You are challenged. Humanity is challenged and, ironically, humanity is the source of that challenge, even though it is fair to say that very few of you are aware of this. Most go about their daily business without any thought toward the consequences of their actions and their thoughts. The vast majority of what you call the western world is deeply immersed in materialism, has little inclination toward spirituality and, as such, is lost in their true way of being and purpose. Rather, they insist on all the distractions that are available to them as they live their daily lives. The momentum created by all these disharmonious conditions continues to drag humanity toward the abyss and continues to reinforce and to pull humanity toward that which is greater disharmony.

I know that you feel this, my beloved friends. As you become more sensitive, as you seek to be more spiritually attuned, you feel the momentum, the power of the human condition continuing to disrupt your efforts and, in many ways, discredit your efforts. This is a very unfortunate situation, a situation that is in great need of correction. God has put forth a plan, a plan that you may be a part of. In your own way, through prayers and gatherings such as this, you are a part of. Yet, that plan is so vast and so intricate, it would be very difficult for you to understand. You must sit in this light and this prayer. You must direct your thoughts toward higher consciousness. You must have faith in the workings and unfolding of this plan.

Faith for the mind is a challenge. For within the mind is a deep desire to know, to have the details, to understand every step forward and to feel confident in that step. Yet, you have been asked to have faith, to trust and to not be overly concerned or analytical about the future. I know this is difficult for you. At times, it engenders fear and confusion. Yet, when you step forward in innocence, in the light of soul, trusting in the Will of God, then you are at your highest condition, not obstructed by mental speculation and ideas.

Your capacity to understand is very limited indeed. Your capacity to feel your way through conditions is much stronger, for this comes from the soul mind and the soul consciousness. This is where you must lay your trust. This is where you must abide by your guidance. As you trust in this, and as you find that in trusting more harmony ensues and that you are not endangered by your lack of material knowledge, rather you are empowered by your spiritual knowledge, then you might move forward more readily and at a swifter pace.

I urge you, beloved souls, to not doubt yourselves. I urge you to be aware that the conditions around you and the propensity of humanity to disrupt and to surge toward greater disruption can be within your consciousness. Yet, when you empower it with fear, then you are doing yourself a great disservice. Remember that you are walking against the current of these conditions, not with it. As such, you are not truly a part of it. You are a part of something else, something of light, part of God's plan. Thus, when you engage in this human condition, this current of behaviour, an impetus toward greater darkness and disharmony, then you create a disruption within yourself, a discontent. You contradict the laws and the ways of being that you have been taught.

You are stronger than this, beloved souls. You are stronger than this. It is time to assert your light, your strength, your faith and your trust in God's Will. For the Divine Will will ensure that humanity will come to its senses and that harmony will be instilled upon your Earth. It will take some doing, some changes, some adjustments and some challenges, but God's Will, as you might surmise, is far stronger than human will.

God must work with what He has created. Within humanity He has created free will. He will not contradict this free will, but He will shepherd humanity toward the consciousness required, the understanding needed and the motivation within, inspiration given by God, so that humanity will, in time, shift toward that which is the current of light rather than the current of darkness. This is a great challenge. Yet, there are many forces arrayed to help bring this necessity forward. You are a part of this. Your prayers are part of this. Your light is a part of this. You will find that others will want to listen to what you have to say.

These two instruments will be speaking on the morrow. I will be there with them. There will be many there who wish to listen to what they have to say. For some, it will not be acceptable or popular. For others, they will be inspired. This is the way of the world. Each of you will have your opportunities and the possibility of speaking to others. When that opportunity is given to you, seek to be inspired, not of the mind, but of the soul. For when you speak from your soul and when the mind allows and accepts this flow of information to come forward, then you add light to the world. You add a degree of enlightenment to others.

The message of the reclamation of Earth must be given. It is not all doom and gloom. I say, there are great forces arrayed toward bringing harmony back and this will prevail. This will be your destiny as a race upon this planet that is out on one spiral arm of a galaxy, a small place in a vast universe. Yet, God's Love and God's creation that is this place will prevail and will, in time, express harmony.

My beloved friends, have faith in the Will of God. Allow your souls to show you the way. Step forward when that way is shown, when your consciousness comes to that place of understanding. You will not only be protected, guided and safe in a world in turmoil, but you will be an instrument for change, a beautiful channel of light. This is why we invest our time and effort with you. God's Love for humanity is great, beyond your capacity to know. With our development spiritually, our souls in the Light of God's Love completely, we have a greater understanding than you.

Still, we are not capable of fully knowing the capacity of God's Love. Yet, in His Love, He seeks to redeem humanity from its terrible fate created by humanity's desire to be empowered without knowing what true power is, to act without wisdom and to be unloving, rather than to put love above all other things. This correction is needed, and it shall be. In the face of all resistance of humanity, it shall be and shall become a new way, a new journey for humanity toward greater progress and harmony, peace and truth.

It is coming and so we prepare, do we not? All the ways that we connect are with our Creator. All the ways in which we correct ourselves in thinking, all the ways in which we express love and light and all the ways that we may express truth, these things come as you put forth your effort. I urge you to continue with your efforts, to continue to focus and make what you can of your life toward greater harmony and express your being in the harmony of truth and love.

We are with you, my friends. I am Orion. I am with you in your journey toward light. I stand beside you as you go against the currents of human endeavour. Know that strength is given, protection is given, and you will succeed in your endeavours, you will succeed. God bless you. My love is with you always, my friends. Intrepid travellers, beautiful lights, I love you.
