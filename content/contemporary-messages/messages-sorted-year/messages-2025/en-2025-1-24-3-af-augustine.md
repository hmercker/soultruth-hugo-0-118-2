# Describes Receptivity of Humanity's Minds and Souls and Conditions of Readiness Required for Manifestations

January 24<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Augustine received by Al Fike

It is your teacher Augustine. You speak of the yearning soul and you speak of how to reach that soul, to bring the Truth of the Father's Love to the conscious recollection of that soul. Every soul created by God has a yearning for His Love and closeness to His Being. For every soul created was in that state of communion with God before incarnating into the world. Thus, that yearning continues, for the loss is acute to the soul who has incarnated. Your dilemma and your question are how might you excite a conscious recollection of that yearning? How might you convince another that indeed that yearning can be fulfilled with the blessing of the Father's Love?

Since your world is that of words and thoughts, most commonly, your approach is to express yourself with thought and words to another. When you do so, remember that you have an angel by your side who is working also to excite a desire within the individual to seek the Father's Love, to initiate the process of reconciliation between the individual and God. We work together in tandem, you in the flesh and we in Spirit, complementing God's desire to bring that individual back into the communion and relationship the soul desires to have.

The ways and means of that being accomplished are varied, considering the individual who you are dealing with. At times, it is most effective to have no words at all but to sit with the individual, with the Love in your heart and soul flowing through you, from God to that individual. At other times, those who are very much in mindful concern find words important and the correct words are most important to that person.

We will help you. We will guide you as to what to say. You have all the knowledge within. Each of you have read and researched this Truth. Each of you are well-educated in this Truth, so it is not difficult for you to reveal this Truth. The difficulty lies in the way in which you may do so and do so with finesse and eloquence, that you might inspire and uplift that individual, that they may be captured within the words and within the Love that always flows.

Then there are those who are sensitive. First, they feel. Then, they seek to understand that feeling, that experience. These are the ones who are more likely than the others to come into the fold. For when they feel this Love, when they come to embrace it, the soul cries out in joy, in relief and in desire for more. Those of you who are sensitive understand what I say, that within you, when you heard of this Truth from another, or when you have done your research and found this Truth, within you the great bell of truth rang clear and loud. There was a recognition. There was an acknowledgment that indeed this is Truth.

Those individuals are the ones who are easy for you to gather. Unfortunately, they are not the common souls who wander the Earth. Yet, you find in your groupings and your work that there are those scattered around the globe who have been captured by the Truth and inspired by the Truth. They are the ones who we nurture, that God blesses and you befriend. There will be others. On the scale of the globe, there are many.

Unfortunately, in the smaller centres, your countries, cities, etc., they are few and far between. Many of these individuals have opted for the natural love path, the one that is easier to follow and understand, the one that stimulates the mind and the soul. But, you will find as the years progress, that you will accumulate many of these interested souls. You will have opportunities to teach, to gather together in Circles of Light and to visit and confer with one another. There will be those who are mindfully seeking, who will come upon this path.

Generally, the great majority of individuals in the world today will not be interested in this message of Truth. They are so well-entrenched within their mindful pursuits, their somnambulance, their apathy, their confusion and their darkness, that they are virtually unreachable at this time. Times come, however, when they will wake and find themselves in great need and in desperate situations. In this, the doors will open and the ways will be made obvious to you as God's instruments. They will be desperate and seeking, in great angst and fear.

You will be guided, beloved souls, in such a way that you will gather many and they will listen. You will be a light, a comfort to many. You will be strong and clear in the grace of God. You will find that God will use you in ways that will capture the imagination and attention of others. They will want more from you. In those days of great need and great change in the world, you will need to be strong, steadfast in great light, to exercise great faith and to walk not with the casual step of those who feel secure in God's Love, but with the earnestness of those who wish to serve God and all that God has in need of your service.

So the time comes, beloved souls, where you will be greatly needed and greatly supported, guided and protected. In those days, the thought that your efforts go unheeded and that many do not wish to hear what you have to say will be replaced by a great urgency and great clamouring of souls. We are with you in efforts to prepare and to uphold, to inspire and to inform. We are together, beautiful souls, upon a journey, not merely to fulfil you and to comfort you, but also to prepare you and to strengthen you.

As you seek out the Father's Love, as you continue to grow in this Love, as the pace quickens for your continued growth and strengthening in light glowing, you will come to that place of wisdom, strength and capacity to serve in great measure. You will not be forsaken by God, nor will you be weakened by your ministries and your purpose. Rather, you will grow bold, strong and capable in this.

The days of lamenting that you speak upon a deaf ear will be days that you will wish for in the future, for the demands upon you will be great and the blessings upon you will be greater. So, enjoy and appreciate the tender care that God gives you at this time, the opportunities that are laid before you at this time, that allow you an even pace toward truth and toward strengthening and growing in Love, for these things come readily to you. Your life is one of great blessings and peace.

**JF:** Augustine, may I ask a question?

**Augustine:** You may.

**JF:** What conditions of readiness do we, as Divine Love followers who have been preparing for manifestations through direct voice, need? What conditions of readiness do you suggest may be required, optimal for these phenomena to come through?

**Augustine:** You have received many pieces of guidance that will indicate the conditions required and what is required of you. In terms of what will come in the future, and we have indicated that direct voice will be manifest through each of you in the future, those conditions will be determined by humanity as a whole and the condition of the Earth. The demand for this, the hunger for this, will come as a result of the anxieties and concerns that humanity will have responding to Earth changes. As I have said, you must come to the readiness and physical, emotional, spiritual and soulful strength that will allow you to be that instrument, clear and capable.

These things are predicated upon your free will choices, efforts and preparations. God cannot use an instrument that is passive and lackadaisical in their commitment. God uses those who are inspired, strong, clear, focused and desiring of being an instrument of God, a channel of Love and all that that might entail with the individual soul.

These things are complex. I do not wish to reiterate what has already been spoken many times in regard to your own personal preparation, each one. But, indeed, the time grows short and the preparations are sorely needed. Each of you knows your weaknesses, your shortcomings and those conditions within you that are in need of your attention and your efforts. We cannot override your free will. We cannot tell you specifically what you must do.  Yet, within you, within your soul, within your consciousness, the wisdom resides there.

Often, you play a game with yourselves. You conveniently ignore the strongest need for correction. You ask God for help. You plead with God for correction, without your true participation, that by some miracle, you will be healed, you will be corrected and you will find a way that is easy and gratifying. Indeed, when it comes to the physical body, you are in control. Your decisions have direct consequences to the well-being of that body. Of your spirit, it is dependent on the well-being of your mind, thoughts and intentions. You are responsible for this. Regarding your soul, it is being nurtured and strengthened by the great gift of God's Love and you are responsible to seek this Love.

The responsibility lies upon each of you, your actions, your thoughts, your efforts and your prayers. This we have told you almost daily. This I know you hear to a degree, but there is a part of you that is still immature and requires that you are uplifted by us, by God, without much effort on your part. When you mature and realise that there is equal measure of this blessing of upliftment, then you become truly in alignment with what is required.

Do not shirk your responsibilities, beloved souls. We say this to you who are mature, who have followed this Truth a great deal. We are not speaking to beginners. We are speaking to those who are wise in the Truth. We lay out and remind you of your responsibilities and encourage you to continue to follow that road and be in harmony with the laws of God, God's creation and God's Love. It is not that difficult for a soul such as yours, each one of you, but it requires strength and discipline. It requires desire and dedication. It requires humility and grace. These things you are aware of. It is within your ability, within your capacity for truth, that you may abide by these things.

So, I leave it with you, beloved souls. Ask yourselves the questions. Am I truly walking the Path of Love in all ways, on all levels of my existence, all aspects of who I am? Or am I relying upon my angel friends to uplift me where I am willfully weak and upon God to heal me when my desire and pattern is that of sustaining habits that are not helpful and able to bring physical, emotional and spiritual strength?

These are the hard questions, I know, but I pose these questions to those of you who desire to commit yourselves as instruments of God. You must look deep within yourself. Introspection is needed. Prayer and understanding are needed. Forgiveness of yourself is needed. But, also, within that forgiveness is a decision to step forward in new ways that will counteract old patterns.

It is for you to decide. It has always been so. It is the case for every soul. You must, as you grow and strengthen in the Love of God, make those difficult decisions for yourself and stick by those decisions in loving acknowledgement that God will support every step forward, every way in which you make that effort to be in harmony with yourself, your creation and your soul.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, in the great grace and Love of God, for this will uphold you, this will heal you and this will bring you to harmony. But, in the path quickened and sure, it requires your commitment, your wisdom and your decision to be in harmony with God's laws. God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to speak plainly to you. But I come in love and desire that you continue to improve in all ways, to be strong in all ways and to know the joy of that strength and harmony that comes. God bless you. Your teacher, Augustine, loves you dearly. Bless you.
