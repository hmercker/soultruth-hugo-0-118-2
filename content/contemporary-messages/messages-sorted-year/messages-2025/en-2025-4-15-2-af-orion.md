# How Close Are You to the Will of God?

Orion received by Al Fike

Imagine yourselves on the forefront of the spiritual awakening of your world. I am Orion. This is our plan. This is the plan not only that we carry, but is subscribed to by your angel friends, bright spirits and those of you on Earth dedicated to the transformation of your world. Yet, for those who are able and willing, strong enough, clear enough, dedicated enough to carry through in their role and their way of instrumentality, to be a part of this requires a dedication that you have not yet been a part of or expressed in your life. It will take a great deal from you. It will ask a great deal of you. It will carry you to many places in the world. Indeed, your comforts may not be of the first priority. Rather, some of these places are quite primitive. Your situation may be taxing and challenging.

Are you prepared for this? Indeed, as changes happen in the world, there will be less comfort and more challenges. Are you prepared for this? To date, we have been very close. Most of you have had very comfortable lives and you do not know for want. Rather, you have been blessed mightily, in many different ways, materially and spiritually. God is generous with these blessings. We are generous with our time and efforts to uphold you. The universe is generous to those who seek light, but we cannot nullify every difficult situation and bring you into a place of extreme comfort and detachment from material challenges.

It is your responsibility to consider how far you are willing to go, how much you are willing to give and how flexible you are regarding what might be asked of you. I do not say these things to discourage you, my beloved friends. I say them to inform you and for you to prepare yourself also in this way, your bodies and your minds in such a way that you are in harmony with the desires of your soul to be a channel of love, to be an instrument of peace and to bring the Truth of God's great blessing to all.

Those who are in need do not inhabit luxurious hotels or live in first world, as you would call it, comfort. Many are poor, many are needy and many live in squalor. Are you willing to enter into these conditions? Are you willing to forgo your judgments and your disdain of these conditions and these individuals? It is important to ask these questions, to consider what you are willing to do, how far you are willing to go. With faith, ideally, you can go anywhere and do anything. Yet, it is a crucial question. How deep is your faith? How deep is your love for God and for humanity?

You may know and say all the right things. You may have all the information. You may be blessed within your soul with light and wisdom, but if you are not willing to go out into the world as an expression of those things, an instrument of God, one who carries great faith, one who is willing to surmount the obstacles that might stand in your way, both internally and externally, then you are on the horns of a dilemma, my friends. For where much is given, much is expected. You have been given a great deal. Not that it has been given with the idea that you must pay a price and that we exact a price. No, this is not the way it works in the universe of God. Rather, as you rise up the ladder of progression, within you is a desire to circumvent pain in others, to help bring harmony to others and to be a channel of love for others.

You do so in your own way, but often it is predicated by a desire to be comfortable and to have the ease of this expression and this environment. Yet, as conditions worsen and as need intensifies, how will you cope? Stretching the envelope, as you would call it, being in environments and conditions that you are not used to, being brave, strong and able to walk in the world wherever God may lead you, these are the questions. It is for you to contemplate, to truly ask yourself what you are willing to do. Some of you have impediments that would preclude going into conditions that are difficult to manoeuvre, but some of you have impediments within your mind that hold you back from this, that hold great judgment and fear of these conditions.

I must bring to you these questions and ask you, are you willing? Can you cope? Can you put aside your fears? Can you let go of certain expectations and be free in the flow of God's Will? For in that freedom comes many blessings, many blessings indeed, but you must be willing. You must look within to see where the impediments lie and to ask God to help you remove these things to bring that element of discipline within your mind and to circumvent the judgments and fears that you carry deep within.

You will receive all the assistance you require, but what is required of you is a focus upon those impediments and a desire to release them. That way, when you are called, you will act without hesitation, without fear and without judgment. We are here to help you remove these things and to fill those spaces with the Divine Love of God. We continue in our journey of progression. This includes the progression of mind, thought and deed. It is up to you, my friends. How far are you willing to go? How close are you to the Will of God? How much do you desire to enact that Will without hesitation?

May you be blessed in the great gift of God's Love, strengthening and brightening your soul and, in this, informing and cleansing your mind and being that true instrument of God. It awaits you, beloved souls, always. We wait. God waits. We all wait for your choices and decisions, but the time grows short, my friends. I urge you to have deep contemplation and consideration of your limitations, especially those that are self-imposed.

May you be blessed in freedom, joy, wisdom, love, compassion for yourself and for others, compassion for the world. God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. Oh, how I love you. Oh, how I feel for your struggles. So many challenges, so much to be addressed. May you be blessed. God bless you. Orion loves you.
