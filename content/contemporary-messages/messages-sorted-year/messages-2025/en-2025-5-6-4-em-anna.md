# Allow Your Light to Shine

May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Anna received by Elizabeth Mack

Allow your light to shine. Allow the Father's Love to enter your souls. Allow. Allow.

It is just that simple. You can let go of those things that impede you. You can drop them and open to the Father's Will. Open your souls. The world needs your light. Allow that light to shine brightly. You are such beautiful souls. If you could only see what we see. Let your love flow, dear children of God. We implore you, for time is shortening with every breath. Let your love flow.

I am your sister, Anna, and I love you. I love each of you. I pray with you. Whether you are together or you are alone, I pray with you.
