Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, your sister in Christ, Care.

May the love of God be upon us and in us.

In your walk on earth, in your wish to truly feel the Divine Love and to be at one with the heavenly Father, you come to this circle. Many of you have walked a multitude of paths seeking truth, seeking the source of love. As seekers, you may have walked ancient trails, ancient pathways, visited shrines, temples, places where miraculous events have occurred and been reported, perhaps seeking a healing. These inclinations come from the soul, a soul that wishes to feel the love of God. At some point, a leap of faith is required, that you may move from tradition and ritual and dogma to the engagement of your soul with its Creator. When I stepped out in faith, miracles occurred, and the more I trusted in my soul and my relationship with God and the angels, the more doors opened up. It was a simple walk, mine, but it was true, and I was rewarded each day with the glorious presence of the heavenly Father and His love for me.

As you pray, I ask you to release all your thoughts of unworthiness, all your doubts, your fears, and your anger. Forgive all those who have hurt you and ask for forgiveness for those you may have hurt, so that God may heal you and fill your soul with His essence.

When we communicate with you, we bring a light, a celestial light, to illuminate your soul, to bring healing energy and this vibration, where the magnetism of Godâ€™s love draws you in, lifts you up, showers you, and blesses you.

Your prayers not only bring the love of God into your souls but also activate your relationship with Him. This engagement is eternal. May your prayers lead you to ever-changing gifts of clarity, of healing, and of sharing the light in your souls with the world. In the mystery of where all things are birthed is the love of God throughout the universe, so vast, and yet, so near. Ever-present is this blessing. So be still. Listen with your soul, and together we shall walk in faith and in the great love of God. I thank you and I love you. May God bless you.

I am Care.
