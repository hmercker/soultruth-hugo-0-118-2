# Soul Development Will Bring You to a True Understanding of God and Spirituality

September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Josephus received by Al Fike

Thank you, my friends. I am Josephus. While I walked the Earth, I was an orator, philosopher, and writer. I used my mind extensively to understand the ways of the Earth. Indeed, I gained a reputation and acknowledgement for these tasks and gifts. The question is, did I get closer to God through exercising these gifts?

In the mind, I was educated and opinionated regarding who and what God was. I felt powerful in my words and my thoughts. Because of the confidence of my words and thoughts, others listened, but was I any closer to God? I would say not, for God became an abstract image of the mind rather than a true knowing of the soul. I did not come to truly know God until I entered into the spirit world and understood more fully what spirituality is.

I am pleased to hear you all speak of these things, to acknowledge that your articulation of what you call truth is not truth at all, but merely a shadow of the truth. Truth comes with experience, experience of the soul relating to God. As this relationship grows, as your ability to know God grows, as you receive more of this great gift of Divine Love that fuels the awakening of the soul, then the experience deepens. The knowledge widens, the profound understanding of God and Love of God and love for God expands and becomes the overriding reality of your life.

Every soul must go through this process. Often, first, they come to understand God from the mind and they believe that their beliefs are the truth. When they are humbled, realising that the mind does not truly carry the ability to know truth, then they must start again. As Jesus often said, to be as a child, to be innocent, to be open, to allow the Touch of God in, not through the mind, but through the soul. As that Touch deepens, as the soul grows and awakens, then the capacity for truth becomes something that will lead the individual into the great realms of conscious truth. Truth comes with soul perceptions and experience.

We acknowledge that many of you begin with the mind and are often endeared to the mind rather than the soul, for this is the place that is comfortable. This is the place that is familiar. Indeed, you must work beyond it and you must trust and have faith in the process of soul awakening. For you to be able to validate truth through the experience and perceptions of the soul, you will come to know God through your soul. This has been told many times. You will come to feel God, the power of His Love, the grace that is God's Touch. This is the foundation of truth. For without that experience, without truly knowing God in this way, you merely speculate and ruminate as to what God is. When the soul brings you to its Creator, opens you, opens your eyes and ears, your consciousness, to the Presence of God, then you have experienced a revelation like none other. As His Love flows into your soul, you experience the truth like none other.

These things come to you with diligence, prayer and desire, your soul speaking to God, and God speaking to your soul. As this communication intensifies and clarifies, the mind is left to be of itself, listening, absorbing and accepting that which your soul is experiencing. This is true humility. This is the state of being that brings the receptivity of soul experiencing consciousness, putting aside the desire to be dominant in thought and accepting the reality of the soul, which is all so different from the reality of the mind. In time, the mind of the soul will take precedence and in time will absorb the material mind. This comes much later in your progression. Until that time, I urge you to be humble yet intense in your desire to be with God, to listen, to absorb, to feel, to be at peace and to know that God, with every breath that you take, wishes to communicate with you and for you to communicate with God.

Be that humble child that comes to the Creator filled with hope and promise, wanting connection and love, seeking truth and harmony. You will know a life fulfilled. You will know your place with God and will feel all the benefits, all the blessings of God that come with this. I urge you forward, my beautiful friends. Know that Love awaits you, in abundance so great you could not possibly comprehend, that God is with you every moment. This is for you to realise, to feel it and to know it. May you continue on your journeys toward at-onement with God, and we will journey with you, for we know the way and we know it well.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Josephus. My love for you is great, sojourners upon the path of truth, children of God. Be love, know love, express love and all else will fall into place. Thank you for listening to me, and God bless you.
