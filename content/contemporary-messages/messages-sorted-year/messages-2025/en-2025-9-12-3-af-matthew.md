# Those Who Truly Seek God Shall Find Him

September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Matthew received by Al Fike

May God be your Will. May the Love of God be your Love. May the Truth of God be your Truth. May all that is of God be part of your life and your experience in life. I am Matthew and I come to speak to you of things of the soul.

The soul seeks God with every breath, but it must find a conscious expression, a way in which that desire to be with God is released from your being to God's great Soul, igniting the Laws of Prayer, igniting the response. When you ask for this great gift of Divine Love, and do so with the true longings of the soul, then you receive the gift. It is given freely and in accordance to the intensity of your prayers.

Many find God by accident. It is haphazard. It is not found in a direct way. Yet, those who truly seek God will find God. Those who want God will have God in their lives. It is an act of will and desire, an expression. I urge you, beloved souls, to know your own soul and the desires within, for this will lead to truth and the fulfilment of that aching, longing for truth and for God. Each of you have many feelings within the soul. You have many desires, even of the mind, to be in harmony with God, for without this, you know something is missing, something has not been fulfilled.

As you seek, as you pray, as you desire, so God hears, knows and feels those things from you. God will respond accordingly. Listen, my beloveds, listen to the Breath of God, the whisperings of God, all that God gives in His Love and you will find fulfilment there, the fulfilment of your questions, the fulfilment of your ache and longing for Love, the fulfilment of the expression of your soul in the world. All is given freely. All shall be given in accordance to your efforts.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, with the great gift of His Love and awakened with that gift and all that you are and all that you can be awakened with Love. It is freely offered. I urge you to accept the offer and to embrace God in Love. You will find that all that you are seeking will be given in time as you seek further, as you grow more, as you awaken to the deeper part of yourself on the journey of at-onement with God. I am Matthew and I come in love. I love each one of you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
