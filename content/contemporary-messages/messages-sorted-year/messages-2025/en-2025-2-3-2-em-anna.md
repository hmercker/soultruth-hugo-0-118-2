# You Are Acknowledged by God

February 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Rock Hill, SC, USA

Anna received by Elizabeth Mack

I come with the grace of God. I am Anna. I am the mother of Mary. I come to bring tidings of love to the children upon this screen and upon this Earth. Usually, I stay in the background, but today I come to speak to the gentle-hearted souls who are quiet in their love expressions.

You are acknowledged by God. You may possess this Love and exercise it in ways that many people do not see or are aware of, but know that God not only sees you, but knows you, loves you and acknowledges you as you do the work of building this Kingdom, quietly, humbly and cheerfully.

I too was quiet behind the scenes, but a mother can have a great influence on her children. God, our God, our Creator, our Father, has an even greater influence upon His children. Influence is not always loud, obvious and celebratory. To those of you who are quiet, as well as those who make more obvious contributions to building this Kingdom, God acknowledges you for your work and the Father does feel gratitude and joy when His children are expressing this Love.

I bring you blessings from the Father. Be joyful whatever you do and continue in your prayers to connect with God at every moment for the greatest measure of happiness. May God bless you.
