# The Power of Free Will and the Journey to Light

September 28<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May there be a great inflowing of God's Love into your souls, my brothers and sisters. I am with you. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you this day. The amount of this blessing to enter into you is determined by your receptivity, your desire and how much you want to receive this gift. This is the law in action. This is how God has created this blessing to be given to you. This is why you are given the gift of free will above all other creatures. You have this gift of choice. It is for you to exercise this gift in your lives, to bring light, to bring love, to bring the blessings of God upon you. If you choose to ignore God and say that God does not exist, then you close that door. If you are humble, open and receptive to the blessings of God, then that door is opened and much can come of it.

The power of free will is tremendous in scope. It determines your life, for with each breath, each moment, you choose something. I urge you to choose for the highest, to seek out the blessings of God, to seek out that which is within you, that beautiful gift of a soul. As you discover this gift, as you come to know it in all its beauty and ramifications, then you will find the key to opening the door to all that is within God's universe. When awareness comes, when you are empowered by truth, when that truth becomes truly a part of you, then the journey toward light and enlightenment comes swift and sure.

There are no back steps upon that journey. Possibly you will hesitate and make some time to integrate what you have learned, but you will always move forward, my beloveds, always move toward God, toward at-onement with God. That journey will stretch along the road to eternity. It will be given. It will be given in abundance. All that God has for you, all that is and can be for you, will be given freely. The only impediment is your will, your choice. I encourage you, my beloveds, to choose for the highest, to recognise the desires of your soul, to be in alignment with God, to be open to God's Will and God's blessings for each one of you. This way you become liberated from the human condition. The healing power of God's Touch, God's Holy Spirit upon your soul, is great and deep and shall expunge all conditions that are not in harmony with God's Laws of Love.

May you be open and willing. May you be humble and penitent. May you know the grace of God in all its glory and wonderment and feel the power of its redemptive qualities, to cleanse and to heal, to awaken and transform. These are the gifts given by God. These are the gifts which I espoused and taught while I walked the Earth. These gifts live within me. All that is of my soul reflects the great gift of God's Love. When I say, "These things I do, you may do also," I say the gifts within your soul, the blessings of God's Love that ignite those gifts, will bring the wonders and blessings to you and to those around you. For you will emanate this blessing, the power of this blessing, and you will be God's channels of love and light. You speak of Circles of Light. I say, engage within those circles. Help to ignite and form those circles around the world, so that God may be active through you and that, as the great Love of God inflows into your soul, you may be God's active agent in the world.

So much depends upon your dedications, my beloved brothers and sisters. So much is required of you. So much can be given through you. Yet, first and foremost, you must activate your soul with this gift that comes in prayer and blessings from the Heavenly Father. As you come into alignment, you will discover aspects of yourself that you never knew existed. You will express parts of you that are a stranger to you now, but will come alive, those parts, those attributes that lay dormant but require the gift and Touch of the Father's Love. It will show to you the wonderment of your own creation, the magnificence of your own soul. For God has laid riches within that may be ignited by His great Touch of Love.

May you come to know your true selves, my brothers and sisters. Come to know the power and glory of this self that is you, that shall be you, that shall become the wonderment of a soul awakened in the Father's Love. I bring my love to you, my beloveds. I encourage you forward, for I am the living example of this Love, as are many who inhabit the Celestial Kingdom. May you come to know us and be close to us. We will be close to you in great effort that our love for you will be known and felt, that the blessings of God's Love shall be known and felt and all shall work towards the glory of greater light within you and greater light within the world.

We shall continue upon this journey, my beloved brothers and sisters. We are lights that shall burn bright and bring, in time, peace to this world of yours. Follow me, my beloveds. Follow me. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom and a channel of God's Love. God bless you. God bless you all.
