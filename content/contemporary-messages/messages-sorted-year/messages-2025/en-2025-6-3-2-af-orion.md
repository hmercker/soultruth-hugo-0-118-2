Orion received by Al Fike

You are each progressing, my beloved friends. I am Orion. Each of you, in your own way, have overcome various hurdles and barriers. Each of you are learning the power of love and how to express love in ways that are in harmony with the Laws of Love. Indeed, you find your way along this path of love and light, seeking greater truth, seeking greater development of the soul, seeking to be in harmony with God, harmony with one another and harmony with the world. You progress, my beloved friends. Indeed, as you continue to put those intentions forward, then you will progress, and you will be in greater light with each step you take.

I know we have said this many times, but I urge you, do not underestimate the power of the Divine Essence and how it will change you, how you will shift in your attitudes, priorities and desires, how you will come to know yourself in a way that you have never known yourself, how you will come to know God in a way that you have not known God and how you will come to know life in a way that you have not known life. Yes, your enthusiasm and desire to be in the truth, to be in light and to know life continues to propel you forward. Yet, that desire is shifting from a conscious desire of the material mind and consciousness to that of the soul. As that transition takes place and you become more acquainted with your soul, the perceptions of your soul and the expressions of your soul, progress will be made. Shifts of consciousness will come about, a domino effect, one small choice affecting many choices, one experience informing many experiences and one prayer affecting all your prayers.

Yes, you do not know when that shift will happen. It may happen tomorrow. It may happen with some prayer that you make, reaching out to the Creator of all. Yet, it will happen, beloved souls. You will find yourself in a new world, a world that you perceive from the soul rather than the mind. Indeed, those perceptions and experiences that come with your fleshy body will still be valid, but how you interpret them and how you come to know them will be different, because rather than processing these experiences through the synapses of your brain and the consciousness of your material mind, you will be shifting toward the consciousness of soul. In this, everything changes. In this, you will find yourself a bit of a stranger in a strange world. Yet, as you integrate, as you change and shift, you will become more comfortable and more acclimated to this new way of being and experiencing life.

Indeed, all the possibilities, all that you require to make that shift, exist within you. It is a matter of time for acceptance, for eagerness, for openness and desire. You, and only you, may determine this, the timing and the place for this shift to take place. This shift will not be one great shift into consciousness, but will be one step into another, until the dawn of realisation comes to you, the openings and the “ahas”, as you call it, come to you, until you see for yourself exactly what we have been speaking of. You will feel for yourself what we have told you about. You will be joyful in this new dawning of awareness, this new form of experience and interacting with the material world.

It comes step by step, my friends. It is the opening of your soul to its awakening. With this awakening will come the expression of gifts, the manifestations of those gifts in ways that will astound you and astound others. The shift is just beyond your reach, requiring more prayer, requiring a concerted effort to put aside the old ways, the old thoughts, fears, angers, judgements, all those things of the human condition, all those things that you have experienced and that live within you to a degree. As you detach yourself from these conditions, the awakening of the soul is ushered forward into your consciousness and shall cause great movement, great thundering awarenesses and great joy. It comes because the power of God's Love is well beyond your comprehension, but it exists within you and surely will have its effects upon you. This is how this Truth operates. It must cause change, shifts and awakenings. This is the power of God's Love and it is within each one of you.

God bless you, my friends. May you know the grandeur of this great Love working within you and how it will change the landscape within each one. Your consciousness shall grow, not in the ways of the intellect, but in the ways of the soul’s knowing and understanding. The rest will follow, my beloved friends. I am Orion and I love you all. God bless you all in His Love. May the changes be swift but harmonious, be powerful but not so much so that you lose your bearings. Most of all, be loving and joyful, for this is what you seek, and this surely is what the world requires. God bless you, my friends. My love is with you always. God bless you.
