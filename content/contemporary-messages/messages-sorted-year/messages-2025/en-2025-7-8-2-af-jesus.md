# Welcomes Us to the Great Hall of Peace

July 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Indeed, I welcome you to the Hall of Peace. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. As you have called me, so I am here. I am here because the power of your prayers allows my presence to be with you. The power of the longing of your souls brings the great gift of God's Love into your midst, the Holy Spirit blessing each of you with this gift.

Indeed, our desire is to uplift you. God's desire is to bless you. All the resources of love, light and truth are at your feet, beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. There is nothing that can withhold these gifts and blessings to you, beloved souls, nothing on this world that can keep you from God. For God has given you the gift of a soul and in that gift is the ability to commune with your Creator. Indeed, as you exercise that gift, as you say your prayers and express your longings to God, so the fulfilment of the law is present. You are given what God wishes to give to you, which is the great Light of Truth and Love burning bright within your souls, keeping you in alignment with all that is in harmony with God's creation.

May you come to see and know this alignment in a conscious way. May you come to utilise the wisdom and strength of the soul that is imbued by Love in such a way that you are servants of God, channels of love and blessings for others. As you walk upon the Path Divine, know that many are with you. Angels come close and God's blessing is available to you at any moment. Any time that you pray earnestly for this gift, the response is the inflowing of His Love into your soul. We are all brothers and sisters in this regard. We are all walking along this road together and we shall do so for all eternity. We are God's children, claimed and transformed by the gift of His Love. We shall be truly in the harmony and grace of this gift. We shall know at-onement with God.

Feel the peace that passes all understanding, my beloveds. This peace comes with God's Love. Know the harmony that ensues within the soul, a soul that feels and recognises the Touch of its Creator, the soul that longs for at-onement, the soul that seeks the nourishment of Love, the Love of God's great Soul. All is given in peace, joy and light. Seek this out, beloved brethren. Seek out the gifts, the blessings of our heavenly Father. You will find fulfilment there beyond your dreams and reckonings. Fulfilment comes with the simple but powerful longing of your soul.

May we all yearn together, my beloveds, and seek the solace of the soul that comes by God's answering of your prayers. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I pray with you and I am with you, your brother in truth and love. May the Christ Spirit enter into you, beloveds, forevermore. God bless you. I love you.
