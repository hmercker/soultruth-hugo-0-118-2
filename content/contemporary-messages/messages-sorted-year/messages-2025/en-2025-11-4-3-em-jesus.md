# Recognising Some of God's Blessings

November 4<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Rock Hill, SC, USA

Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I am your brother. I am your friend. I am the Master of the Celestial Heavens. My Father sends me with blessings, some of which are already bestowed upon your souls as I entered this circle, for He has many blessings, many gifts to bestow upon His children who choose to possess this Divine Love in their souls and continue to progress toward His Light along the journey prepared for each one, that journey specific to each individual soul and with the help of a multitude of other souls who have walked their own journey.

Do you understand the blessing of these guides showing you the way, feeling love for you beyond measure, that which brings you closer and in more harmony? Do you understand this blessing of Celestial Angels praying with you whenever you ask them to join you? So many blessings, many of which your minds are unaware of, but your soul grasps onto, because your soul’s desire to become at one with our Father is significant and grows with each prayer, another blessing from our Father to His children. Your soul changes, grows brighter and sparkles with this Divine Love that activates every part of you, another blessing from our Father.

These blessings are but a few of the innumerable number of blessings set before you, available to you, that come with your prayers so deep, so sincere, from your soul longing to be at one with your Creator. Some of you know and are aware of some of these blessings. More and more will come to you because their souls feel the radiance that your soul is becoming. Let that radiance shine. Allow the Truth of this blessing in your soul to shine forth, that others may benefit, that others may learn from you and that others may seek what you have received from God. Allow your blessings to shine. Be open to that which you are being given [^1]. This too is a blessing, for you will be given more. I ask this of you now. I ask for your commitment now to continue your journey, to do your prayers and continue to assist in ways that God provides for you. For there are many, many souls desiring to know how to pray, who to pray to and many other truths that you hold within your souls. Now is the time. You are the souls, along with many others, who have chosen to bring about this transformation.

I am with you. I will always be with you, as will many of the other Celestial Angels. We will never, ever leave you as you stand in truth among your fellow brothers and sisters. I bless you. I bless you with God's blessings. May you be open to receive and continue to fulfil your purpose of your creation. I love you dearly, brothers and sisters, and God loves you even more. May God bless you each and every day that you are open to receive. God bless you.
