# Continues His Work Sharing the Truths of Divine Love in Barbados

January 26<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Starpoint Retreat, Christ Church, Barbados

James Tudor Snr received by Al Fike

Bartholomew and I are good friends. We work together. In my day upon the Earth, and you have probably heard my story, I tried to bring these truths to my fellow countrymen with a measure of success. However, people being people, there were disagreements, fracturing and a lack of unity.

So, we begin anew, do we not, to bring this to your countrymen and to bring this to the world. I am very pleased indeed to be a part of it. I feel something you would be surprised to hear me say, that I am humbled by the opportunity.

We will work together, my friends. Work for the good of humanity. Work to bring humanity out of ignorance, out of the low and dark places where they are lost, steeped in ignorance and falsity, steeped in their own humanness to such a degree that there is great unhappiness in so many.

I will be close and I will make all efforts possible to assist you in this work. Be true to yourself and be true to God. In this, you will find the way that will, in time, make you qualified to enter the gates of Heaven.

May you be blessed, my friends. I am James and I love you, each one. I am glad you are together, taking this time from such busy lives to be in prayer, to be with God and to be with one another. God bless you. God bless you all.
