# The Importance of Prayer

Greetings, my friends, I am Faith. It does my heart good to see friends come together in prayer. Praying in your world, in your cultures, is somewhat of a rarity, reserved for Sundays at church or other times designated, but you understand prayer. You see that prayer adds to any occasion and adds to any purpose. For when you pray and are close to God, then the blessings of God flow into whatever you are doing, wherever you are and whatever the gathering may be.

I understood this as well, in my day. I prayed a lot. I prayed alone. I prayed with groups. I prayed with friends. I was always encouraging prayer. So should you, my friends. So should you. Encourage others to open up to God, first and foremost, to receive that blessing of God, the blessing of His Love, to open to that blessing together. Together, you commune in the holy Touch that is God, His Holy Spirit.

It brings a sense of family, of bonding and of togetherness. In this world, it is a rarity as well to have that sense of connection with others. Yes, there are many occasions when there is a superficial bonding and people come together and speak of mundane things. At times, they are joyful and happy. So, I do not criticise this, but why not go deeper? Why not be in that great, holy communion with your Heavenly Father?

When that is done, when you feel that connection and you are rejoicing within it, then what conversation will ensue from that? What important matter will you share? How will you be with one another? Because you have shared your authentic self in prayer, so you are benefiting from that openness of sharing. Indeed, it makes possible beautiful and important openings of your being to one another.

I urge you to pray. Pray together. Pray often. Be with God. In this way, the pitfalls of this human condition cannot really touch you or cause you concern. Rather, you are in the grace of God and you are sustaining that grace with prayer. You are walking together, almost as a prayer, as you affirm the bonds between you, the soul bonds that are so powerful, important and eternal.

Truly be in the grace of God, my friends. Do not thwart that calling, but answer it with dignity, grace, desire and authenticity, all the beautiful aspects of your being. Shout out to God. “I am here. I am with You. I love You.” Three important statements that will bring the laws in action and bring the blessings forward.

God loves you and is willing to give all to you. First, you must ask and be with God, not with your mind and its distractions, not with the material body and its distractions, but with God and your soul, communing together and being true to both desires, the desire of God to bless you and the desire of your soul to be blessed.

How fortunate it is that you know the art of prayer, that you may put a prayer forth at any given time that is not only beautiful, but it is powerful in its authenticity and sincerity. We are with God. We shall be, over and over again. We build the light together. You build the light within you. You help build the light around you. You help the world by bringing light to it.
May you be blessed in all that is light, all that is beautiful and all that can change the world from darkness to light. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Faith. I love you and I pray with you now. God bless you.
