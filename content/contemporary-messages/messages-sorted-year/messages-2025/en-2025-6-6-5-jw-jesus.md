# I am the Captain of your ship

Jesus received by Jimbeau Walsh
 
May God’s love be with you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus.

I come to bless this circle and to inform you that your work is holy, that your circle is sacred, and that your humbleness, your humility, has brought you close to God and opened up your souls that the Holy Spirit may bring His love to each one.

You are like a ship on a turbulent sea, carrying precious cargo, hoping to navigate troubled waters. I am the captain of your ship, and it is God and His spirit that puts the wind in the sails and steers your ship to safe waters.

You may wonder, as you have been promised my protection and the protection of the celestial angels, that safety will be yours, and I will say, we do what we can to protect you physically, to protect your hearts, to ease your minds. But even I, who spoke truth to the powerful, had to often remove myself from the powers that be on earth who would do me harm. And so, I would go off into prayer, my soul at one with the Heavenly Father, and I would come back and instruct my followers, my disciples. Some who wanted to revolt and thought I was somehow their leader, but I did not come for this purpose, and as you have read through James Padgett, Albert Fike, and others, my truths were simple. My explanations of the soul and its journey these are things that were not understood by those who came after me, and yet, through the centuries, those who prayed, their prayers going to the Heavenly Father, they were transformed as you are being transformed. I knew that whatever harm could come to me physically, that they could not destroy my soul and so the more I lived from my soul, the less concerned I was about my physical safety, and as you know, I survived, and you also know the message was not about my blood, my dying for the sins of others, for each one must become responsible for their actions. But clearly, my message of divine truth, being born again, the soul being transformed from the mere image to the very substance, has found a home.

And I tell you, be not concerned about those who consider you to be enemies of what their truth is, and I would encourage you not to react in kind to hatred, to cruelty, to unkindness. Love them anyway, and if confronted, love them. For the love in your souls, the protection of the angels, and the laws of the universe are yours when in grace, and they cannot harm your souls. So, speak to them from the place of love. Do not be disturbed.

I can tell you that I was pursued by those in power. I was not welcomed by the hypocrites that I spoke out against, but I did not sway from being in the love of the Father. I spoke truth and I lived it, not perfectly, as you may imagine, but as perfectly as possible, and I was transformed on earth and now evermore so, but my heart will always be yours. My mission will always embrace you. My guidance and blessings are yours for the asking, for we are all God’s children and one in His love, as the song goes.

I thank my brother for taking this message, and I am pleased with it. I kept him up last night for several hours, so he’s a bit weary, but I protected his heart.  And so, allow the love of God to be yours. Know that you are bonified in every way and that your prayers have brought the Father’s love into this place, into your souls. So, rejoice. We are with you. God bless you, each one. I am your brother and friend, Master of the celestial heavens.

I am Jesus, and I love you.
