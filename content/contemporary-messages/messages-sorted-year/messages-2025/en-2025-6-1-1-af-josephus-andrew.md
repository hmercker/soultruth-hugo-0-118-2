Josephus & Andrew received by Al Fike

**Josephus:** Blessings to you, dear son. Your heartfelt prayer is known by God. I am Josephus. I come to speak about prayer, the power of prayer. Indeed, as prayer is intense, heartfelt, clear and directed toward God, beaming forth from the soul to God's great Soul, so the possibilities of the effects of that prayer may be great, even exponentially powerful. For when a prayer is said in this way, then the blessings that flow may be great and may touch many.

When a prayer from the soul is asked and directed toward God, then God's response is in relation to the power of that prayer. When we ask you to pray sincerely, directly and without hesitation, then it is that you may clear the channel, the connection between you and God. When you open yourself to God, not through the filters of your mind or the expectations that may be within the mind, but with the innocence and sincerity of the soul, then there is no obstruction to what may flow between you and God and what may come from God and infuse your soul with His Love.

Prayer is the key to opening that door. Prayer is an expression of the wonderment that is life, that is your life created and expressed through you, the individual. Prayer is of your own expression, your own desire and your own asking. In this way, it is unique. Indeed, as each individual hones their practice of prayer, that continues to awaken to the possibilities of prayer, that allows the feelings and the expressions of the soul to rise forth, touching God, then all that can be transformed shall be transformed in time.

For as you live upon this earthly plane, there are many obstructions to your life, to your consciousness and to that innocence that is within you which is often sullied by the atmosphere of this earthly plane. It is important that you practise prayer often and that you bring yourself to God with all the sincerity, all the desire, all the innocence, all the yearnings that you can bring forth from your soul. When you allow this to be expressed and directed toward God, you are fulfilling one of your soul's purposes, which is to be with God, to connect with God and to love God. In this connection and love, there is a response that is mighty, transformative and beautiful. As you ask for the inflowing of God's Love, so the laws come into effect and you receive this gift. As you pray and open yourself to God, you also open yourself to the potentials of your own soul.

It is through prayer that the soul is awakened, that the soul is cleansed and transformed. It is the beginning of the eternal journey toward abundance with God. Allow God to orchestrate this opening and receiving. When you ask in innocence and openness, you are exercising faith, trusting that God will awaken you. When you allow that trust and faith to blend with your desires and thoughts, and they are propelled by the intensity of your need to be with God, then you will hit the mark. God will hear your prayer clearly and respond in equal measure, if not greater measure, to your prayer.

The great benefits of this are many. You draw to you your angel friends. You draw to you light. You draw to you bright spirits. You draw to you individuals on the Earth who are of like mind and like intentions. You draw to you much that is of light. As that light grows within you, so the light intensifies around you. As you draw into yourself all that your soul requires, so your soul becomes strong and expansive, filled with the grace of God. Prayer is a simple act, but the response to prayer is complex, many-layered and filled with many blessings. I urge you, my friends, put prayer first. Sound the longings of your soul. Express those longings in a prayer that is of your design and your expression. Do not hold back from God. Whatever your feelings are, express them to your Creator. Whatever your longings and desires are, send them forth to the great Soul of God.

There will be an answer to every prayer given that is sincere. The answer may not be what you expect. The response may be delayed, but indeed, as you elicit the Laws of Prayer, then there will always be a response and there will always be a benefit. For prayer asks God to bring greater life, greater Light, greater Love and greater harmony into your life. As you continue to elicit God's blessings, know that God hears everything that you express and knows everything that you are. In that knowing, in that communication between you both, there is the blessing that shall bring further soul progression, light, love and truth. All that each soul desires is given in accordance to the intensity of the expression of prayer.

May you be blessed, dear and beloved souls, with the gifts that God has to give to you. With an awakening soul, may you come to know the truth of all things. With the blessing of life, may more life be added to you by the gift of God's Essence. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Josephus. I come to help inspire and teach, to pray with you and to be with you, as are many angels in your midst at this time. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. God bless you.

**Andrew:** Jesus is with us. As we continue in our prayers to receive the great gift of Godâ€™s Love into our souls. He is praying with us and he has come to each one to bring a blessing. Open yourselves, beloved souls, to all that God has to give and you shall attract the highest of blessings and angels into your midst. I am Andrew and I pray with you. God bless you.
