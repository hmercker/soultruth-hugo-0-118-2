# Make Every Moment a Divine Moment in Your Lives Upon the Earth

February 10<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Rock Hill, SC, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

Oh good and gracious God, these children are so precious, precious to You. We are grateful to be assisting them in their progression. I am your sister, Joan of Arc. I join you in your prayer today with many others. We come to give you our love, to surround you with our love, to bring to you those blessings which will help you to progress along your paths, to give you guidance and to help you move forward.

These are things we do each and every time we come and each and every time you invite us to come. Whether it be in one of these circles or in your own individual prayers, we come, for we are creatures of the Father's Will, serving Him by loving you and helping you. Bring us forward closer as we help you to rise above the earthly conditions.

Moment to moment, we are able to love you if you open to us. Understand what this means. Pray to know what this means. Divine assistance is always available to you, to God's true children upon the Earth. Make every moment a divine moment in your lives upon this Earth. Come to know what it is to express your divinity, even in the form of human beings. Each of you grows stronger. Each of you is bringing your light into this world. Come to know fully what this means for each of you individually, as well as collectively. Spread your lives, your love and your truth that is within your soul. Share it. Spread it across the Earth and bring the joy of this Love to your brothers and sisters.

I am your sister, Joan. I welcome you into our lives as you welcome us into yours. May God bless you. May God rain down upon you all His blessings, all of His Love that He has for each soul in this circle and without. God bless you.
