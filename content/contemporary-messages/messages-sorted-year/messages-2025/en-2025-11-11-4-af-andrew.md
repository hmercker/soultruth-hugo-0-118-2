# Sow the Seeds of Truth

Andrew received by Al Fike

The ground is ripe for tilling, my beloved friends. I am Andrew. It may not seem that way. It is, in truth, a time to sow seeds of truth. It is a time to step forward and speak. It is a time to demonstrate love and all that is of God's Love.

I know it is difficult in this world of yours to go against the flow of common thought and deed, to speak the Truth that Love is the binding agent in the universe and that Love in our souls is the saving grace. There are many who speak these words but have no true understanding of them and you who have a true understanding of them rarely speak the words. It is a bit of a dilemma, is it not? Indeed, we ask you to be in the world, but not of it. Yet, you have taken this so seriously that often you do not engage in the outside world. You would rather be together in love, harmony, and in prayer with God, with the angels and with one another.

There is certainly great merit to this, my friends. To be true to one another and to support and uplift one another, that is important. Yet indeed, for those who are drinking the Living Waters in great abundance, all around you, people thirst and hunger for truth and they have very little to turn to. Those who are all too willing to speak and share often have truth that is born of the mind, the intellect and not truly of the soul. Those who speak of truth with love, tenderness and kindness are often shunned, turned away and seen as weak and feeble in their minds. This is also a dilemma, for the hearts of humanity are hardened by the harshness of your world. It is hard to get through that layer of protection and suspicion, mixed with guilt of what they have done that is not of love.

Yes, the conditions are indeed challenging, but you grow in strength, my friends. You grow in love, in light and wisdom. Indeed, wherever you go, that light shines. There are many souls of which you have caught their attention. Yet, for them to truly awaken the mind with curiosity is difficult. We do not send you out to entertain, to boast and to be those braggarts that are in the world these days, the ones who garner much attention. Rather, the humble servant of God is barely noticed. We are here to help bolster your position in the world. When the gift of Direct Voice is opened, it will garner attention. It will bring curious eyes, ears and minds to you.

As we have said, you must be ready to address those who are sceptical, those who are hopeful, those who wonder and those who dare to wonder. You must step forward in all earnestness and strength, clarity, confidence and humility. To be that channel of love, my beloved friends, is to truly be in alignment with God, to be that channel of love in such a way that the hearts that are hard and protected will melt and be open and tender, that the minds that are full of error and misunderstanding are open to the direct and simple voice and truth that is given, that the souls of humanity may realise that there is truly hope, that there is truly a way to heal the wounds and to open the consciousness toward truth.

Each of you carry truth within you. Some of you are striving diligently to bring that truth forward and feel often that they are speaking on deaf ears, but we have a plan. God has a plan, my beloved friends, to awaken humanity. Unfortunately, the way to do so is to shake them to wakefulness in such a way, with such severity, that it will bring great discomfort and angst, worry to many. Yet, you will be unshakable, my friends. You will be the harbingers of truth and all that we have given you to understand the journey and the plan you must convey to others. You must truly study what has been given, take that in as truth and speak them in your own words, your own ways, to soothe and comfort humanity as well as educate and inspire.

We rely on you greatly, my beloved friends. God relies on you for your dedications, your faith and your love of Him. As we all love God, do we not greatly? May that love for God continue to grow and awaken and flourish into something beautiful and powerful and wondrous. We continue our journey, my beloved friends, a journey of awakening, a journey of service, a journey of truly understanding love and what that love is, what it can do, how it can flourish in the world. Be true to yourselves, my beloved friends. Be true to God. Seek out His Love. All else will follow in its stead.

I am Andrew. I love you so. I am here with my charge. With every prayer, every conversation, every time you gather, I am with you. I am in full support of each one of you as you continue on your journey of self-discovery, of service and of awakening. God bless you, my friends. May His Love continue to flow into you in great proportions, a flood of Love, the Living Waters. May it be yours, my beloved friends. God bless you. God bless you all.
