# Use Your Words Wisely and Only if Needed

May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Claire of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, Claire, once from Assisi. My group of sisters, known as *“the Poor Sisters”*, because we had taken vows of poverty did very little speaking and quite often, we would designate someone to communicate on our behalf but surely we communicated in service, in song, in the work we did and to this day my dear sisters known as *“the Poor Claires”* continue these practices. You may recall the words from Paul, *though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, if I have not love, I am but a clanging bell*. So, I wish to stress to you, not only the importance of the words you choose to speak, but the love you speak them with. You live in a world that does not often listen and when they do, does not often hear, a world that looks but does not see, and sometimes speaks upon deaf ears. As my beloved Francis said, go out and preach the gospel of God’s love to all, and if necessary, use words.

So, it is not the amount of words but the intention behind them that makes a difference in this world. People tend to remember songs of love because the music has drawn them in, and the words have resonated with their hearts. Your words, my dear ones, can resonate with the souls of all you encounter. And when they come from your soul and your blessed hearts, they will be heard. They will listen. And above all things and all words, they will respond to your love. There will be miracles when you trust in God and your soul aligns with the great soul of our Creator. There will be healings, and, above all, there will be transformation as you inspire those you speak to in the love of God to pray, to allow their longings to touch the Creator and be showered in the fountainhead of His great love as you are in this beautiful circle.

May God bless you, each one. I am your sister in Christ, once from Assisi, now an inhabitant of the celestial heavens. I am Claire, and I love you.
