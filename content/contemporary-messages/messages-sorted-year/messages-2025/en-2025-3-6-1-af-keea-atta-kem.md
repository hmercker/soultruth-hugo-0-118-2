# Affirms our Soul Progression

March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

I merely wish to affirm with you your soul's progress. Even though our dear stellar friend (Orion) has his concerns, I want to say that you continue to progress in light. Your souls are continuing to shine in that beautiful light, all the facets reflecting love.

I would agree with our dear friend that you must choose this always, for this is where your strength lies. This is where your beauty is. This is where your instrumentality comes forth. The soul is the way and means of expressing God's Will and God's plan. It is the soul that you must know well and acknowledge always, not just in prayer, but always. In this way, these issues that Orion speaks of will dissipate. They are not as difficult as you might think to dispel.

Be in the grace of God, beloved souls. When you feel you are not, pray. Say a silent prayer wherever you are. Ask God to bless you and the angels to help you. All manner of support will be given. It is for you to open yourself to this blessing, to be receptive and faithful in it and to be at peace. God wants you to be at peace. God delivers peace to you. It is for you to accept the gift, to wrap yourself in light and to be sure of your footing in God's grace.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea atta Kem. My love for you is great. We tend to you in every moment. God bless you. God bless you.
