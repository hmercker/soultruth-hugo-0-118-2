# Guardians Welcome

June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Florida Retreat, Inverness, FL, USA

Claire of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

I welcome you, for I am your guardian, or shall I say, one of the guardians, of this group. And I simply wish to remind you that we are here for you, and to remind you that if you find yourself struggling with your mind, allow the longings of your soul and the desires of your heart to be above that. When you are in love, your heart leaps with joy, and your mind cannot comprehend, but the feeling of joy from your heart overwhelms it. And so, as you allow Divine Love to come in and lift you up and restore joy and humor, your mind will take a back seat to the clarity of your soul. For God whispers in the silence to your soul. It is beyond words, and it is a response to your intention. We are one with you on this journey, and on behalf of all your guardians and your guides, welcome to this blessed circle. I am Claire, and I love you.
