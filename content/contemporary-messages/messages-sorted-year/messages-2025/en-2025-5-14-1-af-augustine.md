# Guidance for Happy Mediums

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. It is your teacher Augustine here. Remember that each individual has their own path and their own expression of gifts. In your world, it is most common to categorise and to box things up with different expectations and ideas of what you are doing in terms of mentoring and teaching. In our world, it is very fluid. When we have guided individual souls to come and participate in your beautiful gatherings, there are a multiplicity of possibilities with each of these individuals. I urge you not to categorise or have firm and specific expectations, but to have faith that God has guided each one into this circle and that they will receive, absorb and integrate the knowledge as best they can, in accordance to their progression and their experience of this time together.

As this instrument has indicated, it is a time of building foundations. Each individual foundation is unique, yet the knowledge and the effort that you make to teach is very much the same, though that individuall absorbs and integrates what is given differently. I urge you to have compassion and patience, to not judge but to love, to give each individual the opportunity to become a part of something that is beautiful, of light, truth and God’s Love. That is what is important, to embrace each one, to be an example for each one so that we might utilise those of you who are gifted to help these individuals find their way to understand and orient themselves toward this focus of developing a firm foundation of truth.

Indeed, each one has gifts of mediumship, but not exactly the same as the other. Still, we desire to establish the channel of communication with them. As we do so, they become firm in their understanding of truth and come to realise that each one has a journey to walk upon and a destiny to fulfil. It is not for you to judge or to delineate what that is, for it is a gift given by God, given to each individual by God. Your role is to reinforce and to encourage that individual to find out what it is that God wishes of them and to find out what God has put within them to fulfil God’s expectations, God’s desire and God’s plan for that individual.

You may call it mediumship, and it is an adequate name, but really it is a journey of discovering the soul and understanding the possibilities and potentials of the soul. Within each individual there is a measure of mediumship. It is something that many can grasp and focus upon. This is indeed what you are doing for them and what we are doing and communicating through you to them, but the layers and complexities of the journey are much greater than this. This is only the beginning of a journey that lasts for eternity. You can well imagine the numbers and complexities of gifts that the individual may have and that the discovery of these things goes on for eternity. It is one small measure of awakening to a gift. It is an opportunity to test out the gifts that one may have with those they might trust and those who have loving support.

We continue on this journey together. We continue to uphold and support those on their individual journeys. It is a gift not only to them but to you and to us, for God opens those possibilities, those blessings not only for one individual but for all involved. This is the way of God, multiple blessings poured upon everyone. As you continue to reach out to your brothers and sisters, you will be blessed. They will be blessed. Your angel friends will be blessed. The world will be blessed. What greater purpose is there than to be involved in and open to these possibilities. Blessings from God that pour upon us all, uplift us all and assist us upon our journeys toward at-onement with God.

You will be guided, beloved souls. You already know within your soul what you will be doing to assist your brothers and sisters. Indeed, we will help you come to that realisation and come to understand your role. Do not worry and fret about it, for this only engages the mind. Be of good faith and good cheer. All will fall into place as it has in the past and as it will in the future. It will indeed be harmonious, indeed be joyful and indeed bring many to a higher level of understanding truth and experiencing truth for themselves. As God’s Love continues to flow abundantly within, so the truth is revealed, so the understanding comes and so all comes into harmony, peace and joy as His Love heals, transforms and uplifts.

God bless you, beloved, beautiful students of truth. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I love you so. You are in harmony and in alignment with what you are meant to do. Do not feel otherwise, for you are blessed richly and loved greatly. God bless you, dear ones. God bless you.
