Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear brothers and sisters, I come in the love of God and to be one in Christ with you. I am Yogananda.

During my time on earth, I met many devotees of God, including Gandhi, whose [wise words](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2025/en-2025-3-17-1-jw-mahatma-gandhi/) came through my brother. Gandhi preached protesting in peace, “ahimsa”, to overcome the yolk of colonialism so that his country would be free. What a great servant and what a beautiful soul he is.

The one thing I came to realize as I would meet beautiful souls on my journey was that the most beautiful had become servants, had begun to live a life in service to others, and I was reminded of Master Jesus washing the feet of His disciples, something only a lowly servant would do.

When my brother here had his epiphanic moment sitting with a teacher he had followed (his guru), he began to go directly to God and was lifted up and truly felt the love of God for the first time and realized he needn’t be bound to any teacher except God. I too, had a guru who is with me now here in spirit (Sri Yukteswar). He was the one who told me, you must go to America, go to the West, bring what I have taught you, and be guided by God every step of the way. And there I was, tossed into a new situation, in a new land, in a very strange environment (for me) and I prayed, and I served and every good and perfect gift was provided me. Places of sanctuary and refuge, gardens, travels, every need I had was taken care of and the more I served, the more God took care of me. This did not happen instantaneously. It was a lesson for the learning. So, I say to you all, my dear ones, let the teachers be your guides, as we are your guides, but let God be truly your guru, your master. For God gives all to those who give Him their all. As you serve others, we are able to serve you and as you ask, you will receive every good and perfect gift.

So, take heart, ask God to take your soul and fill it with His essence. Relax your minds and be free in God’s love so that you may serve this world. You will make a difference, and as you serve each other, each one here and beyond in this community of Divine Love around the world, you bring your gifts to your brothers and sisters, lifting them up. For where one is weak another is strong. Where one is blinded, another one has insight. Where one is afraid, another has courage, and all come together for the love of God and in the love of God. This is the blessing you bring, and there is none greater.

I will step back and join you in this beautiful prayer in this circle so full of light and love. May God bless us with a great inflowing of Divine Love. I am your brother and friend. I am Yogananda. Go in peace and in the love of God.
