# Q&A in Running Springs

April 27<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Running Springs, CA, USA

Orion received by Al Fike

I am Orion. I have come because you have called me. I arrive because I am glad to be with you, beautiful souls of Earth, friends that I have made, friends who I cherish. I hear you wish to ask questions of me. I am here to answer your questions. If this will help you to understand the nature of the universe, the nature of the universe within yourself, then I am here at your disposal. I am happy to be so.

*Question: Thank you, Orion. We are just so thrilled to have you back with us again. Our first question is: we have heard messages that humans have been around since Adam and Eve and our moral compasses have gone up and down. The question is, cavemen such as Neanderthals, are they humans with human souls, but their souls are so degraded that they act very animalistic?*

Yes, there have been renditions and various branches off of the tree of humanity that have died out over millennia. They have been purposeful in their application and life upon the Earth plane. They indeed did possess souls and still do, and continue to thrive in the spirit world, but their strain, their branch of that tree, did not carry on to this day. Yet, indeed, they are your brothers and sisters.

*Question: A follow-up question. If it is true that they are with human souls, have a lot of them progressed in the spirit world to become Celestial Angels?*

Indeed, the entire purpose of life is progression. Since they were given and experienced the gift of life, then it follows that they must progress, whether that be on the earthly plane or within the spirit worlds. They will and do progress, and have progressed and some have entered into the Celestial Kingdom.

Now, it must be understood that as the individual progresses their human form, as you would call it, changes and reflects that progression. You would not recognise a Neanderthal in the higher spheres of spirit, because their image, their bodies, have changed in accordance with the progression that they have made. Certainly, within the Celestial Kingdom, they would be completely unrecognisable, as would anyone who would have lived upon the Earth plane and progressed into the Celestial Kingdom, that very high order and vibration, as you would call it, will look different, will reflect the progression of their souls, the reflection of their souls into an image that is truly themselves, developed and progressed into becoming a true angel, a human that is no longer human but is Celestial.

*Question: Orion, we continue to receive so many questions about what your life is like on your home planet. Today's question is: do you have hobbies? What kinds of things do you like to do? What do you do for fun? Do you have pets? Do multiple timelines exist, multiple outcomes of realities and does your soul access all of them?*

You have asked some rather complex questions regarding timelines and time in itself, but first I will answer the simpler question about our activities on our planet.

We have been created and incarnated upon our planet as humans. You are human and so are we. Of course, every culture has its focus, its expressions, its creativity and its way of living that has been created over time. What you might call “hobbies” are not actually hobbies in our minds, but true expressions of our being. Indeed, they are not material, as you would think of material. These expressions are more to do with communication, to be in rapport with one another, to explore the universe together, our soul minds commingling and rejoicing together in the wonderment of our souls’ capacities to express themselves, gifts that are inherent within our souls, abilities to create music, to sing, to create objects that are beautiful, to create gardens and create structures that are complementary to our needs and to the Earth that is our Earth.

Are these considered hobbies? I would not use that word, but they are activities that we engage within. There are many more, but it would be difficult for me to explain to you in this rather crude form of life that is your planet, compared to the refined life that is our planet. Suffice to say that we are very busy, very creative and express ourselves in a multitude of ways that bring us happiness and joy, that bring to one another happiness and joy. 

We are very content indeed. Boredom is not known on our planet. Our planet is a planet of joy, love and fulfilment, similar to what the descriptions of your Celestial friends have given to their place of domicile, the Celestial Kingdom. There is little difference in terms of that place and where we live, because we have brought what you would call heaven upon Earth and it is indeed a heavenly place and very refined.

It would be difficult for you to recognise this place, because the conditions, energies and vibrational reality, as you would call it, are different from yours, not so material and not so given to material ways of interacting with your planet. Our planet has responded to our energies, our beings, our light and is indeed quite etheric compared to yours. It would be difficult for you to see in detail what exists there  if you were to travel, which would take you many thousands of years of light years, as you would call them, in order to reach that place. Yet, when you had reached that place, I would think you would be sorely disappointed, for there would be nothing to see, nothing to experience, for you have not progressed to that place, that way of perceiving, that would recognise what is there.

As for dimensions and time, these are matters that are beyond your ability to conceive of. Indeed, we understand them quite well. We utilise the knowledge that we have, the conditions that are within us and capacity for continued travel and exploration, bypassing the limitations of time and space, folding these things together, as you would surmise, and coming through these things in such a way that instantaneous travel is obtained.

I could not explain to you through this instrument, who is not familiar with scientific and physical terms, that would allow me to give you the formulas, ways, perceptions and understanding of the material world, the universe as you call it, in such a way that you would be able to accomplish this. Yet, that time will come for humanity. As humanity progresses, as humanity continues to change and evolve, and as humanity continues to develop within themselves the perceptions and capacity to understand these material things and spiritual things, which must be combined in order to understand truly the nature of the universe and to utilise that understanding in ways of travel, communication and exploration of the universe.

I hope I have made myself clear.

*Question: You have given us so much to think about, contemplate and look forward to. Thank you. The next question: psychics who are not on the Divine Love path frequently use the term “Ascended Masters.” Is this another name for a Celestial Angel or a figment of imagination? Another thing they refer to is the Akashic Records and some claim to work with it. Is this a real thing or a figment of imagination? Can you expound?*

There are many evolved and wonderful souls in the universe. From your very limited perspective on the Earth plane and the perspective of many of these psychics and mediums who look to these wonderful spirits and beings and claim that they are Ascended Masters, they continue to project ideas and thoughts around these individuals in such a way that it brings to them the capacity to understand and to categorise these experiences and perceptions of other beings.

In your world, there are many thought paradigms that have been created to understand and to structure this understanding in such a way that it makes sense to the material mind. Unfortunately, the material mind is not truly capable of understanding these things or truly understanding these beings. Rather, the material mind then starts to fabricate ideas and concepts around these beings, which satisfies their egos, their desires for a firm and structured paradigm of explanation of these beings.

Unless that individual who is perceiving, delineating, describing and categorising what they may see, what they may experience and may call “Ascended Masters,” until their souls are developed and the perceptions of the soul, which is different from the material mind, come into play, they cannot truly understand what they are perceiving. They merely project a form, a level of understanding which gives some rudimentary description and understanding of that being, but not the full picture.

Are they truly Ascended Masters? In the minds of men, they are, but in the truth of the universe, they are something else. In time, humanity will come to understand the complexities and beauty, the levels, the layers, the expressions of what the Creator has created. It is complex indeed, layered, and filled with many things that humanity, at this level of understanding, cannot possibly comprehend in any significant way. Rather, I would not say that these things are figments of their imaginations, but they are certainly projections of their mind.

As for Akashic Records, that is a name that you put upon what is truly recorded history. Indeed, this does exist on a certain level or plane of existence. Nothing is lost in the universe, beloved souls. As you have come to understand, nothing is created or destroyed, but rather continues to exist. Often things continue to exist within the minds and souls of men. This is a personal Akashic Record, as you would call it. Yet, also the existence of acts, deeds and thoughts of humanity over many millennia exists in a place. Indeed, the thoughts and actions of all souls in the universe exist in a place that is recorded.

So yes, the Akashic Records do exist. Some have been able to tap in, as you would call it, into these records and come to realise that there is a great font of knowledge and expressions of the past that exists there. It is a wonderful place, a place that has been created by the Divine to help the children of the Divine to understand themselves, their histories and even fundamental laws pertaining to their existence. Thank you.

*Question: Thank you for trying to help us have greater understanding. The next question: how old are the pyramids and who built them? How did humans construct pyramids, Machu Picchu and several ancient cities that today are beyond human technology?*

As I have told you in the past, human history is far longer than you surmise and, within that history, certain abilities and capacities have existed to create structures that are immense and would baffle those who utilise merely material means to build these structures. Therefore, the understanding of how these things have been built has been lost, but indeed you can surmise that these structures were built in ways and means that were not just material, but also in a psychic and spiritual way.

The structures were formed by these ways and means of creating and utilising knowledge, understanding of the world, the universe, in such a way that would help these individuals create more easily and more readily than it would for you, who are very, very ingrained in a material perspective of life. Others have come to utilise gifts and understanding that was passed down through many generations. The pyramids are somewhat older than surmised, but not especially so.

*Question: If extraterrestrial beings helped in creating these places, why are they no longer here and helping?*

We, from other planets, have been engaged with Earth for a very long time, but we do follow edicts and standards that ensure that we do not interfere with human development. We indeed help to inspire and to show, even demonstrate certain things, but these demonstrations may be accepted and utilised in human life or not. We do not force anything upon humanity. We never have. There has never been a race of beings that have come to Earth who intended to force and to change the course of history of humanity. Rather, our intentions have been of the highest. Our intentions are to uphold our brothers and sisters, whom we see as brothers and sisters in the vast universe of God's creation.

Thus we have come in supportive capacities, but we do not and have not come to bring to you abilities and technologies that would be beyond your capacity to understand or beyond your moral fibre to utilise in ways that have been constructive and useful for the benefit of humanity.

Yet, this does not mean that in the past we did not help in a greater way than we have now. It means that in our efforts to help, there have been times when what has been shared has been utilised not for good but for evil and humanity has suffered the consequences of such things in the past. We do not wish to make the same mistakes again, but we wait for the right time, the right opportunities and the right individuals to share our knowledge and our abilities in such a way that will bring greater harmony and greater peace to the world. Thank you.

*Question: If those prior groups of humans had knowledge that was shared and they were more steeped in ways that were spiritual and possibly more in harmony with God, why did they not weather and develop, as your planet did, into greater and greater harmony with God through Divine Love? What led to their downfalls or misutilisation of the things that were shared?*

Are you referring to civilisations that I have spoken of in the past?

*Question: Yes.*

Free will is a very powerful instrument. Any soul that exists in the universe has been endowed with free will. Humanity has exerted free will right from the beginning and this willfulness has caused much suffering in the world. There are times when humanity has come to a place of greater harmony than before, but not great harmony as has been upon our planet. Thus, as you have a saying, *“two steps forward and one step back.”* This is a very true analysis of the progress of humanity.

Humanity does not truly understand the power of free will and the power of their own souls, their own beings, that can bring great harmony to the world, but can bring great deprivation and darkness to the world as well. Rather, humanity throughout the ages has decided that the power of the material mind is what they wish to engender and develop in all its ways and capacities, and they have done so. Yet, a great disservice has been done in the course of human history, because rather than equally developing the soul along with the material mind, it has been an imbalance of great material progress, lacking spiritual progress. Of course, religions and ideas of religion have sprouted up over the aeons of time. Man's use of mind has created religions, ideas of religion and their place within the cosmos, etc., but they have missed the point of the simplicity that the soul might have given to humanity.

It is not to say that all human beings who have existed over the aeons of time have not understood this, for there are a great number who have. Yet, it has not been great enough to change the tide of human history and progress to the point of creating greater harmony in the world. At times there has been harmony and there have been beautiful civilisations, but compared to those beings and those places in the universe that truly know how to utilise the understanding and the power of the soul and integrate this with the power of the physical, the spiritual and the material, humanity has been lacking these capacities and abilities throughout history.

The rise of human history and human abilities comes and goes like waves. There is a peak and a trough and a peak and a trough. Now you have come close to another peak and you are on your way to descending into a trough. Yet, in this particular cycle, there are great applications of assistance, love and beings who surround the world, because the dissension of humanity into this particular trough has the capacity of not being corrected, that there would not be the momentum for a further upliftment toward a peak.

We are hoping to bring humanity to a place that is not so much in decline and then to rise up again quickly. This is our plan. This is the Divine plan. In this, you have been ordained by God to find that level of understanding, that place of realisation, that awakening and opening of greater truth that involves the soul, that involves the spirit and that will come to an integration of these things. The time approaches for this to come about and you will witness something quite extraordinary as a result.

*Question: What specific actions can humanity take to align more closely with the higher frequencies of light and love, as guided by you, Orion, and others, to facilitate personal and collective spiritual evolution?*

I believe I explained this in my previous answers. Indeed, the integration of all parts of your being must be accomplished. How this is integrated, how this is accomplished, is up to your planet specifically, to come to the realisations and to come to the awakenings.

How this is done is left to the forces that are arrayed around your planet and to the Divine Touch upon this planet. These things will come in waves and will come in beautiful bursts of blessings, realisations, awakenings and the dismantling of the civilisations and conditions that humanity has built in a very short time, so that these new ways and new perspectives will flood in easily and readily for humanity to be receptive and to be open toward this.

It is a very dynamic time. There will be many ways and avenues in which humanity will find its way and will open and come to those realisations, awakenings and revelations that are meant to be given at this time. Thank you.

*Question: I know more and more new followers join us, and when you do a Q&A like this, I can see we are having repeated questions. This next question has seven parts to it. I believe some of it you have answered before, but how about if I go through each of the seven questions and leave it to you to decide how much to expand or not. Can you tell us more about the way you raise children on your planet? For example, how are mistakes handled? How do you correct? Do you use consequences in disciplining children?*

I find this somewhat humorous, because you are applying human concepts to life on your planet and projecting them to life upon my planet. Indeed, the way in which humanity exists on my planet does not involve mistakes, does not involve consequences and does not involve anything that may be remotely similar to your planet.

We have evolved to such a degree that to understand our culture, our way of being, how we raise our children, etc., would be somewhat impossible. I would like to say that anything and everything that involves love is what is applied to raising our children and their response to us is love. Indeed, we generate love constantly. Love flows. It is reinforced, it is given and it is received and it is given and returned and given again. The cycle of love grows. Our children understand at a very, very early age what love is and how to express love. They practise how to express love. Yes, they may falter somewhat, but the idea of faltering would be, in your terms, a great success of expressing love. In our terms, that love must spiral up higher and higher in its expression. This is what we teach our children, to refine, to express, to show, to demonstrate and to act upon love.

What love is, is something you, my beloved friends, have a great deal of trouble understanding. Yet, on my planet, we understand love from the beginning. For the entire atmosphere is saturated, saturated with love. It is our natural state of being, a state that comes from the Divine Love from God. It is infused in everything and everyone and continues to grow within everything and everyone. The progress of our planet continues infinitely upon that road that is the progress that comes with the Divine Touch upon this beautiful creation of God.

*Question: Are there diseases like we have here on Earth on your planet? What would be the most common types of death, of passing into spirit? We understand your life span is so much longer than what we have on Earth.*

Death is a fading from one state of being to another and it happens to every created being in the universe. There is no disease where we live. There is only harmony. Yet, there comes a time when the individual chooses to progress into that state of what you would call the spirit world. This is not an inharmonious, difficult or painful time. It is a time of joy where we celebrate this transition.

We do not lose contact with our loved ones. Rather, they are just as present with us as they were before the transition, just in a different form. We have within us the capacity, the perception, to see these individuals just as clearly as you see one another now together on your earthly plane. There is no difficulty, there is no disharmony and there is no pain. It is joy, my friends, pure joy.

*Question: Do you have crime, police, or prisons? What consequences? How do you handle any kinds of crimes?*

How can you be what you call bad in an environment where there is no bad? There is no darkness, there is no disharmony. How can this exist within a being that exists on a planet in a condition that has only light, only love? Yes, the individual has free will, but the contemplation of doing something, of expressing oneself in such a way that would cause disharmony, is by all means, impossible for that individual to do so.

*Questions: Will we see beings from your planet and other ETs in our spirit world or on our Earth plane? Will we be able to see extraterrestrials in our Celestial Kingdom?*

You have already become aware of beings from other planets manifesting on this planet. Some are truly beautiful beings that have manifested, who have come in craft, etc. These beings live rather close to your world, as compared to where we inhabit.

Yes, these beings exist. They are making efforts to bring help and assistance to humanity. Those that are to be wary of are not beings from other planets, but rather manifestations of the human condition. I will not go into those things, for they are not helpful in this regard of our communication.

*Question: On your planet, is it sentient like ours? With Divine Love so much more common on your planet, are there any natural disasters, accidents? Do you have similar events, less severe, less often?*

The weather, the conditions, the ground, the crust of our planet, the air we breathe, etc., all of these elements that you know of on your Earth, although they are somewhat different upon ours, are in harmony because of the conditions that we have created by our continued existence upon our planet.

Therefore, there is no disharmony. What you find as harsh conditions on your planet are the result of your harsh conditions manifested on this planet. There are many, many billions of you helping to generate these conditions. Until you have learned to be in harmony with one another and to be in harmony within yourself, these conditions will continue to manifest on your planet, but they do not manifest on ours.

*Question: Everyone is so interested to know what you look like and everything about you. Our dear friend Dennis has asked for a more detailed description of what you look like because he wants to portray you as accurately as he can on different social media platforms. He is sending you all his love. What can you tell Dennis about what you look like?*

We are similar to you. We stand upright. We are bipedal. We are taller. I am over seven feet tall. I am slender in my body. I have the anatomy similar to yours. The colouration of my skin is not similar to yours. Mine goes from red to magenta because of the atmosphere of the planet in which we inhabit. My arms are somewhat longer than yours. My legs are quite long as well.

My facial features are slender and in harmony with my slender body. My face is somewhat narrow. My eyes are larger than yours, but we do have pupils like you. It is not like your ideas of the aliens who have no definition within their eyes or are completely black. This is not true. In our case, we have irises that have colours from green to orange. They constrict and dilate, as yours do, according to conditions.

We do not have eyebrows. We do not have eyelashes. We do have eyelids. My nose is rather thin and slender. We do not have nostrils like you. We have slits in our noses that are on an angle. We have cheekbones. We have a mouth that is similar to yours, not as wide, but our lips are rather fleshy. Of course, this varies from one individual to another. The facial features are somewhat different from one to another on our planet.

Our foreheads are rather high, but not extraordinarily so. We have hair, as you do, upon the top of our head, but this hair is rather thin. I wear these follicles rather long and they stretch down to my shoulders. I am grey in my hair because I am old. I am 673 years old. I am close to that transitional state.

Of course, I have wisdom from age and this is why I was chosen to come to visit you, to speak with you and to be the emissary for our race with you. I am speaking as a reflection of several others who are with me and communicating the central thoughts that are generated by our combined presence. In a way, I am a medium for my people, using this medium for your people.

I hope this expresses my appearance adequately.

*Question: What is the best prayer to offer to God on behalf of another? Have you ever heard God speak to you?*

God speaks to the universe. The soul can hear. The soul can know. Yet, when you think of God speaking, do you think in words? For that does not exist. This is your soul and your mind interpreting God speaking to you. Yet, God speaks to you at this very moment. God speaks to the universe at this very moment.

It is for you to understand, to come to know, to recognise that Voice of God, which is the Voice of Love, the manifestation of God's great Soul in the universe, speaking, directing and guiding. Yes, I know God. I am humbled by God's Presence in my life, in all of our lives. It is wondrous, magnificent, beautiful and true.

Prayers that are offered are prayers of the heart. Whatever you feel, however you feel, express them to God in the authenticity and truthfulness of your being, This would be an appropriate prayer for you to offer to your Creator.

*Question: Is there anything else you would like to convey to us before closing?*

It is difficult for us to relate to a world and reality that you have created on this world. It is so heavy. It is so marked by material things, material ways of thinking of life, material projections, objectifying everything in your path, objectifying one another and seeing the world as an object. This is a very unfortunate situation.. It is time to look at the world differently, through different eyes, through eyes of the soul, through eyes that are compassionate, through eyes that are joyful, through eyes that are loving, through the abilities to understand and perceive that are multidimensional, that exist within each one of you.

Unfortunately, you have not been able to reconcile this material perception of the world and experience of the world with that of your soul's experience and perception of the world. Yet, these two things are operating side by side. To reconcile the two has become very difficult for you because of the atmosphere in which you live. I have great compassion for you, my friends, for this atmosphere is the opposite dynamic and environment in which I live and my brothers and sisters live. We may speak of our experiences in our world and how we are in our world. Indeed, they are relevant to our world and the conditions within it, but I wonder how much you understand what I am speaking of, as you compare and utilise your perceptions to understand what I have to say.

Oh, there is much progress needed, my beautiful friends, much ability to be developed that is within you, but must be honed, must expand and must become your reality. Of course, you know that what fuels this is what you call Divine Love. I encourage you to continue on your pursuit of this and to be within the reality and flow of the soul within and the Soul of God, so that you may truly come to that place that is harmonious, that integrates the perceptions of the soul and the perceptions of the mind together as one, in harmony, bringing you peace, joy and truth.

Where love will bind, will heal, will bring insight and understanding, where love will be expressed in compassion and truth and peace all about you. Bringing the blessings from God of healing, bringing the blessings of peace and of love. Light abounds from this. It is the secret that brings all humanity, wherever they exist, into the harmony and beauty of God's creation. Strive for this, my friends, and we will strive to help you realise it, all of you, all of this world. We will continue in our efforts. We will continue to assist you. We will continue to bring our light to help you and uplift you.

We are emissaries of God. The Love that is of His Soul flows through us, resides within us and this truly brings us closer to each of you who seek out this Truth and wishes to walk this road. We have the privilege, the blessing to walk beside you and to be with you as you witness and are a part of a transformation like none other in your world. So it will be and so it is, my friends. Our love together shall bring many blessings and much peace to all of you.

Thank you for listening to me. I shall come again and speak when the time is right. May the blessings of God's great Soul enter into yours and become a part of you, truly growing, expanding and changing you. Blessings from beyond. I am Orion and my love for you is great. Thank you.
