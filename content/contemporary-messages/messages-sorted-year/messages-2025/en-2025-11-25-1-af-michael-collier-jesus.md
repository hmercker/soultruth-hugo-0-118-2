**Michael Collier:** Greetings to you, my friends. I am Michael Collier. The question has been asked regarding how you may teach these truths to your brothers and sisters in the world, a world that is so thoroughly distracted by your material, electronic things that you have created, it is difficult to penetrate these conditions. Yet, within each one of you lies the creative soul, a soul that, if you use the analogy of being a diamond with many facets, so you have many gifts and many facets to your personality that may be utilised by God in order to reach others.

You need not worry about the opportunities to reach others, for God will facilitate these opportunities. What you need to do is be open and receptive to your own soul's capacities to reach out and touch another as children of God's Will, as channels of love. For without love being the predominant manifestation that you have in any interaction with another, there is no possibility of truly reaching that soul that is before you. You must be in that condition of love, the flow of love, the manifestation of love for any true connection to take place. The facet of your soul reflecting love is indeed reaching the other soul who is hungering for love and for truth. A very small portion of your communication would be in words in this situation. It is the manifestation of love that is important and effective in communicating truth. The simple words that you may speak may ignite a curiosity within the mind, but the wordless expression of the soul, the beautiful light that is being reflected through the soul, is what is important and powerful in reaching another.

This is how God plants seeds of truth. Though you may consider your mindful and wordful explanations to be the way in which you will plant those seeds, and indeed they are a part of this process, but when the Love of God reflecting through you is added to that communication, when light is all around you and when your presence and touch to that other individual is felt by that individual, then the possibility of those seeds taking root within them is far greater than when you merely intellectualise a concept of truth that is acceptable within the social and language structures that you live by.

Indeed, if you are expressing truth through these structures, through the paradigms of your interactions, it does indeed open a door to a degree, but it cannot be the only way, the only expression that is given. Indeed, you must be brave, forthright and clear and loving in your actions, in your presence, in how you reach out to another. You also must pray to be used as an instrument of God, to truly be within that flow of God's intention to touch another soul. You are the intermediary, just as this instrument is an intermediary for my message and my teaching. To allow this to be so, you must not let your mind be so predominant and so intent in thought and action that the flow of love and the light of the soul are overwhelmed by the power of the mind.

To be that humble, gentle but clear individual, to convey something so very important and crucial regarding the passage of the individual through life, both within the material and the spiritual, requires that balance of clarity and that light that comes as you practise and express your own gifts, your own capacity and ability to communicate on all levels to that individual. When you can do this in harmony, when you can express this with truth shining forth in all its facets, then you are truly doing God's work. God will utilise you in many ways and be effective in guiding you toward many souls where you have allowed yourself to be that multi-dimensional channel, an instrument of God, the beautiful facets of your soul shining forth. This is irresistible to a soul who seeks, the soul who wants to be loved, this beautiful expression of a soul that knows love, that knows that it is loved by God, loved by the angels, and a soul that loves itself, a soul that is loved by those around it in the material plane.

When love is predominant in your life, then you are quite capable of going out into the world and expressing that love in all its forms. That form may be a truth spoken or demonstrated, but it always must be as a reflection of the Love within your soul and a reflection of God's Soul beaming Love through you. This is the foundation of truth. It is the way in which truth may be expressed, demonstrated, spoken, all the different aspects. They are you, my beloved friends. Each of you is capable. Each of you has much to offer to the world, but often you restrict what is offered by your expectations and desires to be heard and seen by another. What you must want and yearn for and pray for is to be heard and seen by your Heavenly Father. When this is truly the case, then you are in that alignment with God that will bring the blessings forth, whether that be peace or healing, a word spoken of truth, a blessing, of love, of light, of all the goodness of God's creation that you are capable of expressing. Then indeed, you are doing God's work and you are having a lasting impression upon those you are connecting with.

Remember that the foundation of all that you do is love, expression, that all that you are is love. That love may be expressed in many different ways. Each of you have your own unique gifts that allow for that expression. My friends, be that channel of love in the world. Express it in all the beautiful and unique ways that are you. Be in alignment with God, so that that expression is clear and beautiful and powerful. It will help change the conditions of the world. It will help another individual on their journey, their journey toward truth. It will help bring light to the world and hopefully peace, but not always. At times, when you stir the soul of another, it is in the way that they might be open and seek truth and seek to be a light themselves.

There are many ways to be God's instruments. You, my beloved friends, represent a great many, many ways to express truth. Acknowledge your true selves. Acknowledge the gifts that you carry. Ask God to utilise you with each day. Surely that prayer will be answered in ways that will astound you, will sometimes gratify you, but it will always be a true expression of God's Will through you.

God bless you, my friends. I am Michael Collier. I hope you have learned something today which has been your will and your wish. It has been my great honour to speak. God bless you all in His Love. Open yourselves fully to this gift. All else will follow in its stead. God bless you. My love is with you, my friends. God bless you.

**Jesus:** God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus.

I come to assure you that when you speak truth in the world, God's Hand is upon you and an angel is with you. I urge you to speak truth, my beloved brothers and sisters, for how else will the world know the truth if there is no one to speak it, to demonstrate it and to be that individual that lives by it? It is your challenge and your responsibility, my beloveds, to live, speak and express the truth, that His Love may burn within you and the blessings of His Touch may flow through you.

As you seek to be God's instruments, so you shall be blessed in this way and in every way. It is yours for the asking. Each of you knows the truth, so each of you must carry the truth into the world and be God's channels of light and love. I am with you when you are the disciples of truth, when you carry the banner of truth, when you speak the words of truth and when you are truly channels of God.

God bless you, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. I am with you. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you all in the great gift of His Love. God bless you all.
