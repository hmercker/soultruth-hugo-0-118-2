# Healing Blessing for the Earth 

January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Mylora. I come to affirm this truth that you have the capacity to attune yourself to the consciousness of Mother Earth and the capacity to attune yourself to the consciousness of God. So, what does this make you, my beloved friends? A bridge between God and Earth, between these two consciousnesses and yourself, that all may be in harmony together, all may be a beautiful flow of love. That your awareness, your capacity to know, may give you that gift of being aware of Mother Earth and being a conduit, a channel of blessings for a beautiful Mother Earth.

As you allow yourself to be that channel, that conduit, then you are in a powerful position to bring many blessings forth. You also benefit from the blessings that Earth has to give to you. God created a universe that is filled with many blessings. Every creation has its place, its part to play. In your world, you may take advantage of the blessings that are available to you, and you may be a channel for blessings for your world.

Of course, it requires your desire and your willingness to be in that alignment, to be attuned, to be a part of the great flow of God's Touch for you, for others and for the world. Be that light, my beloved friends. Be the Love, the Love of God flowing through you. Be that beautiful facilitator of many blessings for your Earth and for one another. In this way, all will flow. All the capacities, channels, the conduits, the blessings will flow. You will know these things, feel them, benefit and know the joy of it.

My beloved friends, all of you have great capacities and abilities. It merely requires allowing yourself to be aware, to adopt and embrace the beautiful blessings that God must give and the beautiful blessings that God wishes to give through you. In this, the connection, the firm and powerful alignment between you and your beloved Mother Earth and you and your beloved Father God will bring many blessings to you and through you.

May you be blessed, my beloveds. Blessed in all things, in all love, in all light. Blessed and fulfilled in the ways and means that God supplies and makes available for you. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. I am Mylora and I love you, beloveds. I love you. God bless you.
