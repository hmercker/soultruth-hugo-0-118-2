Orion received by Al Fike

May the blessings of this great Love of God be yours, continuing to infill your soul, abundance of Love, blessing and transforming you all. I am Orion. I come once again to be with you, to pray with you, to speak with you, to tell you that you are not alone, to tell you that you are loved, to praise you, to guide you, to teach you and to comfort you. I am here to do all these things. I am happy to do so.

Your world is a very diverse place. There is diversity wherever you look. There is diversity in people, diversity in cultures and language, diversity in thoughts, diversity in action, diversity in interaction, attitudes, capacities to listen, to love and to appreciate. My beloved friends, this is so very different from our planet, which has become more homogeneous than this. It is fascinating for us to see this diversity, to appreciate the differences in individuals, to walk amongst you and realise that where one might be a light, another might be dark. Where one is intellectually astute, another may not be so. Where one is innocent, another has great insight and intentions. Some of those intentions are dark and without true harmony.

Indeed, you are a fascinating planet. Yet, the undercurrents that exist, what unifies humanity, is not love. It is materialism. It is seeking material benefit and gratification. You all indulge yourselves with the expectations that others will join you or compete with you, or that because of the differences of attitudes and intellectual understandings, you create hierarchies, divisions and situations that cause competition, jealousies, judgments and a lack of love.

It is love that is the universal force in the universe, the unifying force. It is love that will bring humanity into harmony. Yet, love is so poorly understood on your planet. Love has many definitions and many expressions, but most of these are of a more material way and form. Spiritual love exists. It is often seen between a parent and a child, an individual and God, but rarely is it seen between individuals in a group setting, in a situation that would benefit the higher levels of love.

That is because the yearnings for love that originate in the soul are not heard. They are buried in thought. When the individual ventures out into the world, they are not thinking of being a loving channel, a light in the world. At least, many do not. Thus, these other coarser inclinations are expressed and activate responses in others. The world goes around, as you say, not by love, but often by competition, fear and judgement, the baser conditions of humanity.

Oh, how far you must go in order to make love the currency of your world. Yet, each of you continues to thrive in the Love of God and to try to express that Love wherever you go and whoever you are with. This is the beginning, a start. This is the beginning of the revolution of humanity and the evolution of humanity toward light. You are revolutionaries. You are contradicting the flow and current of the individual pursuit of material favour and gain. You are truly the forerunners for what must be in your world.

Thus, with the love that you carry and the love that you try to express each day, you draw us, your angel friends, bright spirits and beautiful souls on Earth to you. This is the Law of Attraction working in your favour. This is the Law of Love bringing to you the blessings that love brings. You benefit greatly by your intentions and desires. Indeed, you wish to show others how this works and how this can benefit them. You will, in time, show many.

Yet, as the world turns at the moment, it does not turn on love. It turns on other things that are of the human condition and making. Thus, there must come a time when humanity willingly releases these conditions, behaviours, intentions and desires and adopt that which is in harmony with universal creation, where love is the binding force and love is the active agent to bring harmony to a world, to a species and to a planet.

You are teaching revolutionary thought. That thought is not in alignment with much that is part of the idea of love. That thought is somewhat contradictory to many of these ideas. Although these truths exist in your world and some express them clearly and beautifully, but generally, love is thought of as a sentiment, an idea and a concoction of the mind, rather than an expression of the soul. You must teach that love is truly an expression of the soul and that each individual must come to realise this, must come to understand, to express, to nourish and expand in love.

The Love of God, the highest form of love, is what will bring the transformation, the change within the individual. For this Love will compel each individual soul to express itself in harmony with universal Laws of Love, with the creation of Love that is of God. How different your world will be when this takes place, when you are all understanding and expressing this Truth. Then you may join the rest of the universe in this unifying force of Love that is the expression of the Creator of all. Then you will find your place in that great lexicon of human endeavour and existence. Then you will know how truly loved you are. You will find the great wonders of the universe, the great mysteries revealed and resolved in the minds of humanity.

There are great rewards for your efforts, my friends. Humanity will be rewarded if truly humanity can be bound together in the simple truth that they are loved that they may love and that the force of love has dimensions, layers, aspects and facets that are unthought of and unrealised at this time, but will come to the realisation and consciousness of men in due time. In this way, you will use and utilise these forces, this truth, in ways that will propel humanity toward far greater harmony, a life that is indeed resplendent in material well-being, but not so cluttered with material objects and conditions that are so prevalent today. Simplicity will come from truth. Harmony will come from truth. Love will be expressed in all the ways and beauties that are truly an expression of it.

My beloved friends, you have embarked on a great journey. You are only a very small measure within that journey, but now you see how this has changed you, how this is influencing you and how this will continue to bless you. This will become exponentially greater and more powerful in your life. You will find your way on this road toward truth. As you find your way, you are encouraged to share this understanding, this insight, this awareness and expression that all comes that is predicated upon love.

Oh, my beloved friends, you live in such a diverse place, so diverse it is almost chaotic. Yet, you persist. You continue on this journey toward truth and toward the expression of love. Thus, you have our commitment, our dedication to uplift you and assist you. For you are walking the road for the salvation of humanity, the truth that shall set humanity free from the shackles of its own making. You will be exalted, joyful and heard by your brothers and sisters as you share the power, the glory, the wonderment, the peace and the truth that comes with love.

May you be blessed, my beautiful friends, in this day and every day, as you journey toward at-onement with all that is of universal truth and love. These things come step by step and shall be expressed incrementally as you grow and become those instruments of light and of God's intention and plan. You will find your way, beautiful souls. May you be blessed. My love is with you always. I am Orion. I love you. God bless you.
