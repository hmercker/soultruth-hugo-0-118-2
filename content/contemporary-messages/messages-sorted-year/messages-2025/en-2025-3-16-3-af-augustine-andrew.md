# Guidance for European Trip

March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Other Prayer Groups, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine & Andrew received by Al Fike

**Augustine:** It is your teacher, Augustine. We are happy with the progress you have made so far in your plans. As you can see, you have been guided and protected. My wish is that you would exercise more faith. When you have a sense of feeling for something and that feeling is clear, that perception is solid, as you would say, then act upon it without hesitation.

As you continue to grow in faith, there will be less hesitation, more perception and more capacity to make decisions readily and without second guessing yourself. You continue to go between the fluctuations of your mental ruminations and the knowings of your soul. This adds more time and more effort in your deliberations and in ours. Rather, the way is clear and the decisions are simple. Yes, there are conditions and details that must be dealt with in the human, material way, but in terms of the flow of guidance and purpose, you already know what you must do.

Now, you have made a clear choice and we are happy that you have. We are happy that you might take time to be in a place that you enjoy. Indeed, even in those places, you will be used as an instrument, a channel of love. The place that you have designated is in great need of this.  My beautiful friends, students of the truth, do not hesitate and do not ruminate, but be at peace that God has guided you, that the means and ways of doing this will be provided and all will be well. All will be well, beloved friends, beloved travellers, beloved channels of love.

You are blessed and you are carried. You are uplifted and you are guided. Rejoice in this and be confident in your choices. You will have the opportunities to be a channel for many and to bring blessings for those who are eager and are seeking. God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. My love for you is great. God bless you.

**Andrew:** As you have your prayers in groups and retreats, as you call them, much information will be shared, not only with those present, but with those listening in and those who are following your travels.

You continue in your work. You continue as channels of blessings in the world. May you be open to God's plan and Will for your life. May you be blessed accordingly.

I am Andrew. I will be with you on your journeys, as will be many of your guides, gatekeepers and those who are with your acolytes and your students. God bless you. Andrew loves you. God bless you.
