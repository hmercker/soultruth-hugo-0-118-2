John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now. I am John the Beloved. We are raising you high above the Earth plane, free and clear of all of those distractions and negativities. We raise you high into the blissful condition of the Father's Love. Join together your souls, brothers and sisters. Join together in this Love and feel the embrace of your heavenly Father as He pours into your souls, each one, His Essence, His call to you to stand true, to stand tall in this Truth that you know so well.

God is One. God is Love. God's Love is available to each and every soul who longs for it and who yearns for it. Stand in this Truth in your moment to moment existence upon the Earth. You will see what a difference your life will be. Love your brothers and sisters. Accept them for who they are and love them. This will do more for this world than you can possibly fathom.

I am your brother, John the Beloved. I speak to you this way. It is a very simple declaration given by our Father's Will for the transformation of this Earth. You are blessed in knowing this Truth, so stand tall with it and exemplify it in your day to day activities, especially with your brothers and sisters. I am your brother, John the Beloved. I thank you for listening.
