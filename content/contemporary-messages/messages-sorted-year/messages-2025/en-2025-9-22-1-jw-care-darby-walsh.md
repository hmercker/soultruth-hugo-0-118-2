# Consider being busy in Prayer

September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

England Retreat, Newquay, Cornwall, UK

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Care, and it is my delight to be with my beloved and with you, beautiful souls. There are many here in your lineage and beyond. I wish to impart one simple bit of advice, a suggestion. You know the expression busy doing nothing because you tend to be quite busy in many ways. Consider being busy in prayer. Like flipping the light switch on, stopping the momentum of the world, which is so intense around you, around your bubble. So, create sanctuary if you can, not only in the comfort of this lovely space, this atmosphere, but create sanctuary in your souls, that your service to others goes beyond the material, goes beyond the natural, and draws those who are drawn to you with the magnetism of your souls, their light, their love. This will make a difference in the world, though you may not think so.

This will be the place of service that comes from the deeper longings of your beautiful souls, and we shall help you. When you call, we shall come. When you inquire, we shall answer. Perceive our guidance with your souls, and if you must discriminate as to whether one thing is better than the other, go in the direction of light and love. This always brings the answer that you are seeking. I shall step back and join you in this prayer, and I embrace each one of you and I thank you as does my beloved. God bless you.

I am Care.
