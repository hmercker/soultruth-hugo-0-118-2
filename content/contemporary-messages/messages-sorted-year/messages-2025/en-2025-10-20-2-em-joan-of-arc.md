# Earth Changes

October 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

God bless you, brothers and sisters upon the Earth and those of you from the spirit world. I am your sister, Joan, Joan of Arc. I come with blessings from our Heavenly Father to bestow upon each of you. His Love is great and contains many, many blessings, with those I have for you coming by way of my own soul, which also carries many blessings from God.

As your seasons change, you will notice you too are changing and the world is changing. You are in some ways in synchronicity with the changes upon the Earth because your souls carry this Divine Love. As God continues to pour more and more of His energies into this Earth, you are becoming more and more the truth of who you are, because it is consistent with your souls that contain Divine Love and the energies that the Father pours into the Earth. You have often spoken of Earth changes. These are the Earth changes: more and more of God's Love poured into the Earth and more and more of His healing energy poured into the Earth, as well as into your souls.

It is important that you take time to contemplate the changes in your lives and notice also the changes that have occurred, are occurring and will continue to occur on the Earth. Open your eyes. See with your souls and you will notice the synchronicity between your soul's progress and the forward movement of love arising among people upon the Earth. Your prayers are effective. The more you pray for healing of the Earth, healing of your brothers and sisters, healings for yourselves, the more changes occur and the more of God's Love will be permeating this Earth. This is all part of God's plan to save humanity. Open your eyes. See with your soul.

You are blessed. You are gifted with the greatest gift that is in existence. Contemplate upon this gift within you and how you may express it. I am your sister, Joan. It is my pleasure to speak with you today and my love pours out to each one of you. Please try to feel my love as it touches your souls, so that you will come to know me just by my presence. God bless you. My love is with each one of you.
