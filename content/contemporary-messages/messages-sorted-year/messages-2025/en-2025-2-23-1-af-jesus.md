# Intends to Demonstrate the Power of God’s Love for All to See

February 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May the Holy Spirit infill you with His Love in great abundance. May you know this blessing, this light upon you, for it is the gift of our Heavenly Father, given to you freely and with love.

I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you and to be with you. Know that, since the time that I lived upon the Earth, I am greatly expanded in light and blessings of the Father. Since the progression of the soul knows no limits, I have progressed steadily and powerfully since that day. The personage described in the Bible is not the person that speaks to you today, for I am greatly in the Father's Love and I manifest more light than I did then. Someday, I hope to manifest that light for all to see, for all to observe and acknowledge, a demonstration of the power of God's Love within a soul.

I am my Father's most beloved son, the first to bring this great blessing to the world. I progress every moment and every prayer, as you progress with every moment and every prayer. I feel the blessing and privilege to come to you in this light, in this truth, to assure you that the road I take is the road that you follow. The blessing of Love that burns within my soul is the same blessing that burns within your soul. Though I am further along the road, we are all brothers and sisters travelling this path of awakening and enlightening of the soul. In this, my love for you is great. My bond with you as my brothers and sisters is that of family. We are together, a oneness that is known by those who understand and have been blessed and touched deeply by the redeeming Love of God.

I urge you to continue upon this path, to continue to carry the light and to bring the Truth of this Love to others who are lost. My ministry has not halted by my death. It continues to this day and I will be with you. I will increase your light with my presence as you reach out to another soul and bring the Truth of God's redeeming Love to them. Not only I, but the Celestial Angels will come and be with you, for this is the law, the Law of Attraction, the Law of Love, working to your benefit and the benefit of those you speak to. In the multiplication of this light, in the increasing of this Love, so the soul that you are with, the individual or many individuals, will feel the emanations of love. The soul that they possess will respond and stir because of this.

Know that our work is not complete, beloved souls. The gates of Heaven remain open. They are open to all souls who put forth the efforts and prayers to have their souls redeemed by the Father's Love. We are eager to greet all who enter therein, all who are truly children of God. I urge you to continue with this work, the work that is your own redemption, the purification of your soul in Love and the sharing of this truth with others.

God asks you, we ask you, I ask you to carry on this work upon the world. The world is in great need of you. The world is in terrible darkness, ignorance and strife. My beloveds, you are my disciples. You all carry the Light of God's Love burning within you. Walk in the world knowing this. Express yourself in the world, knowing of your efforts as God's being instruments and my disciples. In this way, the work will grow. The numbers of individuals who have a clear understanding of this truth will multiply. There, in time, will be peace upon the world, a world transformed in love.

May you be blessed, my beloved brothers and sisters, in the great power and beauty, the glory of the Father's Touch upon your soul. We come to pray for this together. We shall receive the benediction upon our soul. God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom and truly with you in love. God bless you.
