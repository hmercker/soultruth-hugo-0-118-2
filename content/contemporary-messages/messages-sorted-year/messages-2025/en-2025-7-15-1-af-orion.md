Orion received by Al Fike

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. Since we had missed an appointment earlier in the day to speak [^1], I will speak to the wider family this evening. I wish to assure the two daughters who prayed (Maureen and Elaine) that I am not so difficult to look at, that indeed, I have certain features and facial expressions that they would find amenable [^2]. Indeed, God's creations throughout the universe are not horrific, but have qualities that are appreciable and beautiful. It is a matter of having an open mind and studying what God has created in such a way that you realise that the diversity of the universe is a great benefit to all who inhabit it.

My beloved friends, put aside your doubts. Put aside anything that holds you from God. For now is the time to solidify your faith, to be in harmony with God's Will and to know your own soul intimately and deeply, for the time grows short to have the leisure and the benefit of not struggling in a world that will, in time, turn to great difficulties and great challenges. Whether you have prayed for the great blessing of God's Love for a long time, or whether it has been a short time, the resources focused upon each and every one of you have been great. Angels and stellar friends have gathered around you. God's Hand has been upon you. Great blessings continue to flow to you. Take advantage of every ounce of God's blessings, every moment of His Love poured upon you, all that God wishes to give. For that blessing, the outpouring from God's great Soul to you, is continuous, so you may receive and be attuned to this at any time.

I urge you to continue to focus your lives upon the blessings and growth of your soul, for in times to come, you will see how this focus and your efforts have benefited you greatly and that many in your lives and in this world will wonder how you may walk in peace while there is great chaos, how you may know with surety of your destiny while others are lost, afraid and confused. How well do you know yourself? How well do you know your destiny? How well do you know God? These are the great questions of a life lived. We urge you to live your life in harmony with the Laws of Creation and the Laws of Love. We urge you to be centred within your soul, so that when you are up against great challenges, the wisdom of your soul, the guidance that comes to your soul and through your soul, will carry you through any situation and any challenge that is beset upon you.

My beautiful friends, you have come to know the great and highest Truth of the universe, that Love is surely the glue that holds all together, that ensures harmony in the universe, ensures harmony within you and the universe that is you. Continue to seek out this gift. Continue to be in alignment with God. Further truth and further understanding, perceptions and revelations, joy and awakenings will come to you. There is nothing to hold you back, since you are well aware of the barriers. You are well aware of the human condition that seeks to divert you from the truth. It is now a matter of choice for each one of you to walk upon the Path Divine, as your angel friends call it, and to be truly upon that path with every ounce of your being, every part of your consciousness, everything that you are, that it may come into alignment with all that God intends for you.

There is so much waiting, so much there available at this very moment. The resources of Heaven and Earth are focused upon you, my beloved friends. You will be needed greatly in times to come. Yet, you need, at this moment, at this time in your life, to focus upon the awakening of your soul through receiving the great gift of God's Love. As you turn your gaze upon God, as you turn your gaze inward, as you turn your gaze upward to your brothers and sisters, it is in your desire to know God and to know His Love that all will be realised. All will be awakened. You will be empowered with truth, with light, with love, with peace and with joy.

All things that are of God will be yours, beloved souls, for God does not withhold anything that will uplift and change and bring into harmony your being. It is given fully, abundantly and beautifully to each of you who desires to receive. Do not hold back that desire within you. Do not judge this as being needy. Some even believe that they are bothering God with these things. I say to you, my friends, God's ability to answer prayer, His Touch upon you, is infinite. There is no bleeding away of God's resources, merely tapping into the infinite qualities and blessings that God has to give. Open yourself fully and know that what you receive is barely a speck of what can be given. Open fully, beloved souls, and God will bless you fully and abundantly. You will come to know the Truth of truths, the Love of loves, the Light of lights. All is given in Love.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Orion. I love you so. I pray with you. I open myself as you open yourself. I seek as you seek. I receive as you receive, for we are truly brothers and sisters in this great universe of God's creation. We shall benefit from all that God wishes to give. It is part of your destiny and mine to be in alignment with His Truth and all truth. God bless you. Orion loves you. God bless you, my friends.

[^2]: That afternoon, the group had attempted to generate images of Orion using artificial intelligence, with comical results. Orion is humorously referring to that here.
