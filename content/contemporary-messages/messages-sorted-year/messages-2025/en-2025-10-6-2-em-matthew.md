# Another Purpose for Which We Are Called

October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

Matthew received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Matthew. I live high up in the Celestial Heavens and I follow my master, Jesus, who is Master of the Celestial Heavens, founder of this Kingdom of Divine Love. I am with each one of you in this prayer, for your longings for God's Love are strong and your love for the Father grows with each prayer.

I too love greatly our Heavenly Father, who at this time pours His Love upon each soul in this circle. Even those who are not in this circle, His Love blesses and graces them. For that is the Essence of God: loving, creating, blessing and gathering His children around Him to be instruments to further assist in developing love and more love, not only in this world but in this universe and every part of His creation.

This is why you are called to assist with the development of love, not only in the material, not only in this circle but across the universe. This Love travels and touches others, some of whom are in need, some of whom you can assist, even with the amount of Love that you have within your souls, if it is your desire to do so. For it is God's Will to spread this Love, to express it, to feel it, to accept it, to know it and joyfully exchange the essence of your being, touching the souls of others and uplifting them as you are being uplifted.

Great is God. Powerful is God. His Love touches everything and everyone, if they allow it. Allow it, dear children of God. Allow the Love to come in. Allow the blessings to come. Come to recognise the blessings as they are presented to you. Come to accept them and thank our Heavenly Father for the opportunities given to you.

God bless you, dear children of God. God bless you. My love is with you as well. I am Matthew and I long for the day when we meet in the Celestial Heavens. God bless you.
