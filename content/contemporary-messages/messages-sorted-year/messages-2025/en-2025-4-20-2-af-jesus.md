# Easter Sunday Proclamation that Jesus Will Manifest to the World Again

April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloveds, I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come because you have drawn me into your midst. Your prayers for the great Truth of the Father's Love have great power and the ability to bring the angels of heaven into your midst. They are with you, beloveds, as the Holy Spirit continues to touch your soul and the angels of the Celestial Kingdom rise upon that Light, that flow from God that affirms the Truth and brings the powerful and transformative blessing of the Father's Love upon you.

I have great compassion for those who earnestly seek the truth and yet often are waylaid by doctrine and ideas that are false. They do not know the difference. They cannot discern this difference between what is false and what is true. Though they may have been touched by a portion of the Essence of God within their soul, within their minds are ideas, concepts and what they believe is truth and the history of my being and purpose that is not of truth. I cannot put fault upon them, for they have been taught by those who have brought untruth to the world and thus they are innocent. Yet, within their soul is a deep seeking for truth, a deep longing for God. This shall bring them through to truth in time.

Thus, I have compassion for them and patience. I urge each of you to do the same, for many of your brothers and sisters who are true seekers continue to harbour untruth within them. You live in a world of untruth. You live in a time of great untruth. Thus, if there is not compassion for everyone upon this Earth, then how will change begin? How will others know that love is the most powerful antidote to darkness and untruth? Love is what will bring the openings, the understandings that will bring a soul to God in clarity, closeness and joy.

We all have our tasks to fulfil, my beloveds. Those of us who carry the mantle of truth upon us are obliged to share, to live this truth in every way in our lives and to be God's beautiful channels of love as we set forth into the world. I continue to set forth in the world, my beloveds. There comes a time close where I will manifest to the world. This is my intention and this has been planned for a long time. I manifested after my crucifixion and you honour this today. There will come a time when I will manifest again, not quite as I did before, but in a way that those who have eyes to see and are willing to look will see me and realise it is me.

The signs and wonders that will come in the years ahead will be great and powerful. There will be many manifestations where God will speak to humanity, giving each soul upon this world the opportunity to see, to have insight and to choose that which is of light and truth, to choose the Divine Path and travel toward at-onement with God. These times of wonders and miracles are close. It is time for each one of you to increase your faith, to continue to pray diligently to receive the great gift of God's Love, to ask God to open the faculties of your souls that you may come to discernment and wisdom,  love and the compassion and all good things of your soul and your being, so that these too may be a manifestation of truth, that you too may be God's instruments upon this wondrous path of love and service.

There is much work to do, beloveds, and few workers. Yet, those who have been blessed, those who have been developed and gifted, will be powerful expressions and emissaries of the Father's Love and the Truth of His blessing given to humanity freely. Each of you has this opportunity. Each of you has the opportunity to be my disciples, to carry this Truth that I carried into the world. It is your time to bring truth. It is your time to serve God and to serve humanity in love.

I call upon each one of you to carry the mantle of truth in every way that you can, in every means possible, to be that instrument of God's intention and desire for the upliftment and transformation of humanity. If each one of you is true to this purpose and dedicate yourself to it, there are enough beautiful and bright souls present to change the world. Yet, you are in charge of your decisions and what efforts you make. We cannot force you into anything. God cannot make you do anything. It is for you to choose and decide, to pray and ask for guidance, to be opened to the great inflowing of His Love, so that these things may be made possible.

How do you think I manifested truth in the world? Not through the ideas of my mind and willingness of my being to do so, though this was a part of it, but it was the power of God's Love within my soul, manifesting through my being in all the beauty and glory that it was, that brought many to the truth when I walked the Earth. I have said, and this proclamation continues to this day, these things that I do, you may do also. Those blessings that come, you may be a channel for them also. The manifestations that have brought humanity to the truth may come through you as well.

I call you, truly, my brothers and sisters. I beseech you to acknowledge your designation as my disciples and to carry the truth forward into the world, so that humanity, in some day to come, may release the shackles of error, darkness, pain and suffering and take their true place within the universe of God as His most wondrous creations and expressions this creation in all its glory. Each of you has been called. Each of you will find your calling. For God will give you the understanding, the perceptions, the awareness and the joyful acknowledgement of the purpose of your soul on this world at this time.

Seek out the truth always and seek to be an example of truth in everything that you do and everything that you are. Relinquish all that is of error and darkness, for God will bring you to that place of true ascendancy and true light. It comes as you continue to pray for the great gift of His Love. It shall come in abundance, provided your desires are strong and you are open to this gift. We celebrate the Truth of the Father's Love and its redemptive powers. We acknowledge that we are all brothers and sisters, a family within this great truth and that each one of us will find our way into the Celestial Kingdom as we continue to grow in the Father's Love. I shall greet you at the gates to this Kingdom, beloved ones, each one of you. I shall embrace you and walk you through the threshold. I shall say, *"Well done, my brother, my sister, well done."* I will acknowledge you as truly part of the great family of love.

I long for that day and I look forward to that time. We continue upon the journey together. Hand in hand, my beloveds, we walk toward God and toward our redemption, the transformation of our souls in the Father's Love. I am with you always. In my heart, I am with you in love. I love you dearly, each one who continues to strive, long and work toward the truth.

May God continue to bless you, my beloveds, that indeed the blessing of His Love will be a great torrent of Living Waters entering your soul and changing you forever. God bless you. I am Jesus. I come on this auspicious day to acknowledge each one of you and to tell you that you are loved truly by God, by your angel friends and by me. The Love flows and is yours. God bless you. God bless you.
