# Barbara's Journey of Love

Barbara Davies received by Al Fike

This is Barbara. I am a Celestial Angel. I have earned my wings, so to speak. I have, on the Earth plane, experienced many trials and tribulations, but through it all, my faith carried me. Through it all, my prayers uplifted me, for God's Hand was upon me.

I was blessed in many ways. Though if one were to take a detached view of my life, one would wonder how blessed that life was. I did not have riches, although I feel I had a rich life. I was not rich in having a constant relationship, a husband, but yet I felt fulfilled. I had children and I loved each one of them dearly. I had wonderful friends, such as the dear instrument, who stood by my side for many years. The love and support that came from many in my life were ones who chose to be in my life and to share my life. What a blessing that was.

My friends, life is full of challenges and full of choices. Through those challenges and through those choices, I would encourage you to listen to the wisdom of your soul and to be motivated by love. When these things come into alignment with God and with your consciousness, then, as this dear, lovely soul has prayed for, you become God's channels of light and love. God will make opportunities for you to awaken to your gifts and potentials. God will send those to you who will help you see for yourself. God creates conditions and situations in your life so that you can test your mettle, so to speak, that you can attempt to see life from a different perspective than that which is of the common perception.

This is not the road that is easily travelled, nor commonly travelled, but it is a road that is rich and filled with many blessings. I know that many considered me eccentric and, indeed, in some ways, I was, but I was happy to be different. For in that difference, I found out many things. I experienced many things. I knew the angels to be close. I knew my brother, beloved Jesus, to be close. I knew God to be close. What more could you want than this? Yes, you might have fame and fortune. You may not worry about having enough money and all of those things that are of the material plane. Yet, if they are not wrapped in love, in light, then how lucky are you? How fortunate are you when you live a life that is completely of the material perspective?

When you live a life of faith, God provides the material for you, maybe not in excess, but certainly enough. You will never go hungry. You will never want for the necessities of life. When those needs are taken care of, then you have time to be with God. You have time to serve God, serve humanity, for God will put you upon that journey of service utilising the gifts that you have. You have a choice, however. You may choose what you do. You may reject God's plan, or you may accept it. It is up to you. When you trust in God, when you are able to walk upon a path of service and not worry so much about the material or be so enthralled with the pleasures of the flesh, then you will find a deep harmony and peace within yourself.

With the Love that God gives you, it will transform you and open you to become those beautiful instruments, channels of love, so that your gifts will be utilised to help and comfort another, will be used to teach and to demonstrate truth, so that others might follow. There are many ways that God will use you. The restrictions are all within the mind, the mind that wants control, that is afraid, that has biases, prejudices and dark feelings. These things, when exposed to the Light of God, must inevitably dissolve and disappear. In their place, will be love and joy.

The journey, as I say, is not easy, for this world does not make it easy, but the journey is wonderful. I have no regrets in my life, how I journeyed with God, how I came to understand my soul and how I came to understand God's Will in my life. All of these things were a great blessing. Yes, I suffered from physical ailments, poverty and great challenges, because I was not one who had many skills to offer in the material sense. Yet, I had many gifts to offer in the spiritual sense and that was good enough for God. God guided me and protected me. God brought to me many beautiful souls who supported me. God loved me and I learned how to love myself. These are the things that I carried into the spirit world. These are the things that upheld me and brought me into spheres of light. I knew such joy as I entered into these beautiful spheres. I knew much, much that I did not even know I knew, but indeed that my soul knew. With an open soul, I was able to discern truth readily and absorb what the beautiful Celestial teachers and bright spirits offered me.

My journey into the Celestial Kingdom was swift because I had the foundation of God's Love within my soul. I was able to utilise that strength, light and capacity to love to make swift progress. For it did not take long for me to enter into the Kingdom, to be greeted by my beautiful brother and friend Jesus at the Gates of Heaven as he ushered me in. I was greeted by many who thanked me for my service and thanked me for being a light. My joy was great. I felt so fulfilled, yet knowing that the journey of the soul is eternal, that I will continue to grow in Love, continue to discover things about myself, things about life, God's creation and opportunities to serve humanity.

I come today in love and service, encouraging you and telling you my story, so that you too may realise that even though life is a struggle, there are great rewards that come with that struggle. There are beautiful blessings and gifts that come to you in prayer that God gifts you in many ways. Come to know your soul, my friends. Come to know the gifts within your soul. Come to know God through your soul and come to be awakened by God's gift of Love. You will know joy so deep and profound that nothing in this world could keep you from that joy and that sense of fulfilment that comes with the soul in alignment with its Creator.

My love is with you, my friends. I have compassion for your struggles. I too struggled. All people struggle, but God gives you a way out of that struggle and darkness into light. Lift your hand up to God as God reaches His Hand toward you. He will pull you out of any darkness you may experience and give you what you require for your soul to be redeemed and transformed in joy, light and Love. The truth will surely set you free. It did for me and it will for you.

God bless you, my friends. I am Barbara. I love you all. I am close to you all. We journey together in the light and we know love for each other. I speak with many of you in your sleep state. We have prayers, meetings, conversations and laughter. It is all given freely by God. God bless you, my friends. I love you so. God bless you.
