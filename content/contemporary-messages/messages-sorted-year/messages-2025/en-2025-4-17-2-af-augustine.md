# Walk in Faith When Met With Obstructions

April 17<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Your world is full of challenges, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I know there are times when your plans do not reach fruition. There are times when obstructions follow you upon your course of action. Yet, God's Will will be done, beloveds. It will be done despite any obstructions upon your path, provided you are of faith, you walk with faith and trust in the Will of God.

Where there is anguish and anxiousness regarding unfulfilled plans, this is your mind interfering with the peace of your soul. I urge you not to engage in negativity and judgement, rather to pray for answers and to ask God for peace, for His Love to infill you so that you may be at peace and that you may act in harmony with God's Will. Where there is the possibility of healing and of bringing harmony, you can be assured that we are there to assist, to influence and to bring about that which is of light.

We do this, and we are motivated to do this, with a concern of your soul's continued progress, healing and harmony. Where you often get confused, my beloved and beautiful students, is that you think the subjectivity of your mind and the expectations thereof are what God will bring harmony to and bring peace toward. This is not always the case, because the level in which we are operating and working with you is not of the mind. It is certainly not the priority of the mind, but it is the priority of the soul seeking harmony, love, truth and peace. You are continually challenged by the back and forth between your mind and soul, the two realities living together, seeking to have harmony within you and around you.

We understand your dilemmas and your plight. We have compassion for your frustrations and your anguish, but we cannot change your world. This is the world of free will. This is a world that makes its own choices, soul by soul, individual by individual. Thus, it is for you to engage, if need be, with a world that is intransigent and difficult. This is not easy. We understand it is not, but you are strong and you are wise. You will find your way through that maze of the human condition, finding greater harmony and peace. We are with you in this always, my beloved students. We shall be with you always.

What may appear to be a setback may indeed be a blessing. What may appear to be something that is unjust may be a situation and a condition that cannot be righted or put to that condition that you expect it to be in. This, too, is part of the human condition. As angels, we are limited by what we can do. We cannot change the minds of others, but we can influence with love in the hopes that their mind will gravitate toward loving action. Yet, we cannot countermand the Law of Free Will, and we will not. It is for you to understand the limitations and consequences of your actions and to be wise.

If you pray about an important act that you are contemplating, we will be with you in that prayer. We will advise if you are receptive. If you continue to go ahead, filled with determination and desire to act in a certain way, then you will not hear our guidance or feel our presence. You are in that state completely within your mind. You will have difficulty discerning the wisdom of your soul. There are always lessons to be learned in this regard. There are always consequences to headstrong action compared to the wisdom of soul and the gentleness of love informing your actions. You are human and you make mistakes. You continue to challenge what is harmonious. As you continue to reap the outcomes of your actions that are not in harmony with God, then it is for you to discover and to realise what it is within you that is not in harmony, that does not comply with the flow and Truth of God's Laws of Love.

Your entire life has been spent realising the difference, being challenged by the difference and being compelled to act, changing your ways and your attitudes in order to be in greater compliance with the laws. You cannot judge another in this regard. For each of you has your challenges in this way. Each of you makes your own mistakes. Each of you carries the burden of that. Yet, you know that God loves you nonetheless. We love you. You are loved and we do not judge, but we are compelled to speak the truth and to help you understand the truth. It is for you to monitor your own responses, reactions and decisions as you continue to plan and be a part of God's great plan for the salvation of humanity.

As you continue to act and make your way along this plan, the divine plan, then you feel the harmony that is part of it. There is no doubt that this harmony exists. You walk in between these two worlds, these two conditions. It is difficult to be clear at times, whereas, at others, it becomes evident what is in harmony. Indeed, as you continue to seek out harmony, you will be guided, and you will be blessed. Even when something happens that does not seem to be in harmony with your expectations, it is, in fact, in harmony with God's Will.

Discern the difference, beloved souls. Come to understand your failings, your blind spots and your lack of wisdom and perception. As you continue to see yourself with the eyes of compassion and of truth, you will come to understand how you may proceed in a way that is in harmony at all times. This is not impossible, but it does require shifts in attitude, in perception and in desire. These things within you that are all too human need the transformation of the soul in God's Love and what that will bring to your consciousness, your capacity to discern, perceive and to act in harmony with truth.

The journey continues, my beloveds. These issues that you have been speaking of will not in any way harm your efforts. They are strictly of material concerns, and you will find your way through them. Our hope is that you will do so with love, compassion and patience. We continue upon this journey together. We continue to act within the Will of God and to be God's instruments for the benefit of humanity.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, in God's Love always. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I love you dearly. God bless you. God bless you all.
