# God's Love is All Encompassing and Includes Mercy, Forgiveness and Compassion

May 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

Godâ€™s Love is all encompassing. It includes many gifts within it. It includes mercy and forgiveness. It includes such compassion for each one of His children who struggle upon this Earth. Do not forget these aspects of the Father's Love. One can always, always come to God for the comfort and permission to be forgiven, for that is the nature of God's Love. It is all-encompassing and so available.

I come with blessings from the Father. I am Jesus. My love for all of you is so great. My compassion is great for all that you have to contend with upon this Earth. Yet, you seek the Love of the Father to uplift you, to bring you peace, joy and forgiveness, all that you need and that your souls require along your paths of progression. All you need you may receive from our Heavenly Father. I come to bless you, to allow the Father's Love and Will to come forward through me to you. This blessing will bring you forward as you open your souls to receive it.

May God bless you all. May you open and feel this blessing. May your Love be activated by this blessing. I am your brother. I am Jesus. It is my honour to come this morning with these gifts from our Father.
