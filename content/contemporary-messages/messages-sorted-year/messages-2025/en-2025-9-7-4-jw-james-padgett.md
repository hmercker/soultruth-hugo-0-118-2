# Humility is the Key

September 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Harrow Retreat, Harrow, UK

James Padgett received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother and friend, James Padgett.

You honor my work by suggesting to all the truth that it contains, the truth that I received, and I thank you for this.

I wish to give you a key to unlock the door that sometimes prevents you from being closer to God. This key is humility. For when one humbles oneself before their Creator and sends out true longings to be closer, to be at one, as the dear brother said, there is a response. One needn’t intellectualize the simplicity of prayer, and each one here has been in that place where they called out to God. *“Dear God, help me, touch me, heal me, save me.”* So, I encourage you to call out from your soul, with words, if necessary, and ask God to open up your soul, that His holy spirit may bring His love in a great inflowing, infilling your souls with His light, with His love. This is the leaven in the bread. This is the substance that changes the soul from the mortal to the immortal, from the human to the divine angel. These are the truths of Divine Love, and all here are at your beck and call, and our most gracious God, Father of all, loving Creator, will answer your call with His love.

I shall step back now and join you in this prayer. All my love and blessings to all here. I am your brother and friend, in Christ. I am James Padgett. God bless you.
