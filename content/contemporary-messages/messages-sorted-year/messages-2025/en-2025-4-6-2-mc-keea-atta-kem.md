Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

I am Keea Atta Kem. God bless you as you open your souls to allow your longings to pour out to God and, in good faith, open to receive God's response in accordance with your desires.

Always remember this, dear ones: that it is all in accordance with desire, the power of your desires and where you appoint your desire. Each one of you is growing. Your soul is developing, expanding and brightening every day, with every prayer and with every thought toward God, because as you think of God, your soul is connected to that. Within your thoughts, your loving thoughts for God bring you into a state of gratitude, anticipation, and glory, knowing that you have found your way. You have discovered the path that leads you to at-onement in God, where the Celestial Heavens await you.

I encourage you to enjoy your experience and to enjoy your path, knowing that you will reach the Celestial Heavens. Every day, acknowledge your path to your destiny. In this way, you will experience a profoundly grounded connection to God's Love, present in your current moment, allowing yourself to feel that oneness with God to the degree that you can at this moment in time. When your heart opens and you feel that beautiful leap of joy when you think of God, that is your moment to experience the at-onement, because in those thoughts, you are wrapped in the arms of Love.

It is like a moulding that is occurring, with a chiselling away of those things that are no longer necessary for you to carry. God is sculpting away, bit by bit, to reveal the masterpiece inside, the work of art that He has created in you. You become aware as these aspects fall away. They are chipped away and smoothed over into something that is harmonious, that is creative, that is beautiful. You begin to see who and what you truly are. You begin to perceive the love that you are, the joy, your power to give unconditionally, your power to stand in your light, where you need not compromise or dim your beauty in order for another to feel comfortable. Rather, you understand that this is God's glory shining through you. As you continue on your path of change and awakening, the glory of God shines brighter.

This is where you put your attention. How closely am I walking with God? How aware am I of God's workings through me and upon me? How aware am I of the wisdom of my soul? Do I allow that wisdom to inform me? How comfortable do I feel within my own skin? There are many things that you begin to ponder as the awakening from deep within your being rises, and you have a sense about this. This is what motivates you to continue forth, because as you become stronger in your being and the quality of the Love that is within your soul, the substance of your soul, having received the Substance of God's Soul and His divinity dancing through you, it is an experience that you will become conscious of.

It is all available to you and comes to you in accordance with your desires. Meditate on this, beloveds. What are your desires? The real desires that are inside of you, not the desire that humanity says one should have, or even a close friend. For no one can know you like you can come to know yourself. Only God knows you in your fullest. Allow yourself to dance together with God in a beautiful affair of Love, close and intimate in a way that only you and God can experience. As you keep this relationship close to your heart and make it an absolute number one focused relationship, all things will fall into place in your life, because as you go about your day, you know God is Hand in hand with you.

In this way, you are strong. Together, you dance your life, a life of light, a life of joy and purpose, a life of peace, a life where you truly know where you belong. Soul to soul and Heart to heart with God, you demonstrate a love, a light that is only possible when the Divine lives through you. Bless yourselves each day. Deepen your desire to receive the blessing of God's Love. Enjoy the dance of life that you and God can dance for eternity.

I am Keea Atta Kem. God bless you all as you step onto the dance floor with God. God bless you.
