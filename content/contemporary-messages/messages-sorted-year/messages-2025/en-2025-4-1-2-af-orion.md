# Answer the Call

Orion received by Al Fike

It is not an easy one, my friends. I am Orion. At least for you upon this Earth, there are trials, tribulations, struggles and obstructions. Yet, each of you are strong enough, having deep enough commitment and faith to endure these things and to continue on in your journey toward God and toward your own soul.

I would urge you not to let your mind have its say and determine your course, for this is error in terms of development of the soul. Yes, each of you has experienced and has been educated in the development of the mind, some of you very much so. Yet, this is a different journey, a different course of action that does not require so much in mindful considerations, although, because of how you live upon the Earth plane of yours, it is a part of it and will be, undoubtedly, until the day you pass in the spirit. Yet, you continue to inch along that development of consciousness of soul. You continue to eke out the truth of the soul, the experience of the soul.

For some of you, the mind is so predominant that it is difficult to acknowledge and to experience this part of you. Yet, where does inspiration come? Where does true insight come? Where does truth come? Even though it filters up into your material consciousness, it begins within the soul and the soul is connected to universal truth through the great Creator of all. Indeed, through the power of the soul, once it is developed, once it is recognised and once it is expressed in such a fluid manner that you go rapidly between soul consciousness and material consciousness, very much is given in truth and understanding, in capacities to move and have your life upon the Earth plane in harmony with what God has created.

Very few upon your Earth are able to accomplish this, but some do. Many are not known to you or to anyone, for their perceptions, their experience of the world varies so greatly from the vast majority of your brothers and sisters that they are reluctant to share. They often hide away from this material world. They are afraid of judgment. This is where you must differ, beautiful friends of truth. You must stand forward in truth, in your perceptions and your experience of truth, your perceptions of the soul and its experience of God. You must share these things with great sincerity, humility and grace, for the world needs for you to share to bring truth to them.

Many will baulk at your revelations and your descriptions. Many will challenge you, but there are some, and our hope is that there will be enough, who will subscribe to what you say and put into practice the truth which you share. If this is possible, if there are enough, then this will be the momentum required to change the world. For now, the very, very few on this planet of yours who are aware and are dedicated to this awareness must be steadfast, strong and consistent, not allowing the percolations of the mind to overshadow the true perceptions of the soul.

The language that you use, the way you express the truth is far too intellectual, too complex, so that the simple meaning of truth is lost. I urge you to use simple words that anyone can understand, to share these truths with such sincerity and grace that even those who are sceptical can sense your sincerity and the truth within. When you are strong in this truth, when you do not allow doubts to creep in because they do not exist, when you use simple words that indeed inspire the soul and often the mind to look deeper, to reflect upon these truths, then you will have accomplished something, something in your groups and those who come, those who are seeking, those who are in need of upliftment, support and love.

When you demonstrate the truth in healing, in love and comforting others, then this is a powerful example. Words can be spoken, but actions are more powerful. Love can be aspired to, but truly loving is the example. If you can do these things, my beloved friends, demonstrating the truth, living the truth, being strong and steadfast in the truth, then such things as direct manifestation will come readily and come often.

Yet, you must come to that place of true expression, of true alignment with your Creator and true rapport and communication with us, your angel friends and the bright spirits. If we are in alignment, if we are truly on the same page, as you would say, then, oh, what powerful manifestations can come. Oh, what we can accomplish and do through you and with you. Oh, how you will draw many others who are gifted. When they come to understand this truth, truly feel it and know it for themselves, then you create a great body of gifted souls willing to set forth in the world and be the agents of change so needed.

I share my aspirations, I share my thoughts. I share all that I desire of you and for you, for the time grows short, my friends. We are in great need, desperate need of true and clear instruments of God's plan and Will for humanity. Step forward. Be counted. Answer the call. You will be deeply blessed. All your dreams and aspirations will come true, maybe not in the way that you imagined, but in the way that God imagines and wishes to be. Be true to yourselves. You were born to do this work, beloved and beautiful friends. Answer the call within and you will find the fulfilment and joy like none other.

God bless you, my beloved friends. Keep you in His Love. Keep you strong and steadfast. Pour His Love and healing blessings upon you. God bless you. Orion loves you, loves you so, dear friends of Earth. How privileged I am to know you and to know this place. It is a unique creation of God. Like all habitable planets, they are unique upon themselves. This one has such beauty, such diversity and such potential. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
