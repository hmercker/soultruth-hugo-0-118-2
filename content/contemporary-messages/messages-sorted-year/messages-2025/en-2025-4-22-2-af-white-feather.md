White Feather received by Al Fike

God bless you, beautiful souls of Earth. I am White Feather. I come to remind you of how precious life is, how beautiful are the blessings that God has bestowed upon you that has brought you to this place, that has brought you here and now in the origins and expressions of your soul, to be together now, to acknowledge what God has done for you, the grateful expression of your soul acknowledging how much God loves you and how much God loves the Earth that He has created, the great White Spirit that has brought life to everything, even the stones beneath your feet.

Those things that seem inanimate are indeed alive and have their spirit. All of nature has its spirit expression and life abounding within the creation of God. You are the highest of creations. You have the greatest of potential to be a formidable and beautiful expression of God's creative power. With the blessing of a soul, you are able to bring through blessings from God, blessings of love, blessings of healing, bringing harmony, bringing the rainbow spirit to the world. In this spirit, it brings harmony. It brings a diverse Touch of God, His Spirit into the world.

You are very diverse in your gifts and in your abilities to bring light, healing, harmony and love to those you meet and to the world that is often so far removed from the creation of God and so far removed from what is intended by God. Yet, you seek to come to return to your Creator, to listen to the Creator's Will, to listen to the flow of His Love, the gentle breezes of His Soul, caressing your soul and bringing you into alignment and harmony with all that is intended to be.

You are beloved by God. God loves all His children. God loves all of creation. This great White Spirit, as we call it, is in everything and loves everything. The spirit of life touches the universe, and the universe responds in joy. The birds sing their songs of joy. The animals rest upon the Earth in contentment. Only humanity is restless and does not know what song to sing. Yet, within their hearts and souls there is truly a song unique to each one. They must find that song, find their voice and sing amongst all life, acknowledging in loving terms the beauty of creation, the blessing of the great White Spirit upon them and upon the land.

You will find your voices, my friends who seek the light and the truth. You will find your voices and the song of joy that wells up within your heart and walk upon this land acknowledging how magnificent is God, the Creator, how wondrous is life, the expression of God's great Soul. You will find your way as you continue to seek that which adds life to you, the great blessing that is the Essence of God flowing into you, bringing its wisdom, bringing its vision and bringing its song of joy. It all is gifted to you, each of you who asks, seeks and allows that expression to flow freely through you to the world. Be that channel of love, that instrument of peace, that beautiful expression of a soul close to God, close to love.

I thank you for listening to me today. I am White Feather. I have great love for you, each of you. I acknowledge your struggles, but I also acknowledge the light that you carry and the desires and ambitions to walk in the world as a light and to live a life within the Truth of God. Be that spirit of truth, light and love and God will carry you through the land, many lands, so that you may sing your song of truth and join all of God's creation, acknowledging the wonderment and the beauty that is creation. God bless you, each one, powerfully within your soul, that you may truly sing a sweet and powerful song for others to hear and for God to smile at your beautiful voice carrying through the universe, a song that is uniquely yours. Blessings to you, my friends. Blessings to all.
