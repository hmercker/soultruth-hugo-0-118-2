Yogananda received by Al Fike

I am Yogananda. When you pray like this, you often lift the veil between our world and yours, making this connection between your friends from high places and you on the Earth plane. As you pray, you dispel any conditions that are not of love, bring light and upliftment to you. God blesses you as you open yourselves to that universal Love that is God's Essence. Continue to be open, to seek to refine your understanding and to bring into alignment all that is of goodness, light and love. For as you do so as a daily practice, then you are well on your way to true, soulful connection with God, the Creator of all.

Put aside the thoughts and conditions of the earthly world and feel the expansion and upliftment of your soul, awakening to Love. As you feel this, recognise it. Be sure to add your desires, your longings that come deep from the soul, for this is what will open the passageway to the great blessings of God more fully, clearly and profoundly. As that passageway opens, as you awaken more fully to God's gifts, blessings and guidance, then your life will become more harmonious, more beautiful in its experiences and expressions. For you change the perspective of your consciousness from that of a mind that has striven to be in harmony and yet still its restrictions do not allow for greater understanding and experience compared to the soul. Yet, when you go directly to soul, when you open directly to God, there are no limitations. There is the experience of the moment that continues to awaken the potentials of what can be.

Live for this moment, my friends. Live to be truly in alignment with all that is of the divine. You will find great, great blessings, great benefits, great awakenings and, most of all, a great transformation of the soul. As you walk step by step, as you place your yearnings and desires to God, seek to love God and to be with God, then all answers are given. All true desires of the soul are fulfilled. All that is a mystery becomes your reality and the truth of it will anchor you in the great journey of the soul toward at-onement with God. There is so much to be discovered, so much to know and feel, so much to be experienced, so much to be seen. God will guide you upon that path, the path of discovery, the path of enlightenment. It is yours for the asking. Seek out God. Put your mind at rest and seek out God with the consciousness of the soul and you will find the wonders of the universe within, with this blessing from God, this Divine Love, the Essence of life eternal.

May these blessings be yours, my friends. May you truly come to know your origins and your destiny, for this is all contained within the soul's awareness. It is the great well of truth that comes as you open your souls to God and God fills you with all manner of blessings. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Yogananda. I am close to this dear one, this beautiful soul who seeks with such earnestness and sincerity. With this as your guide and motivation, you will not fail, dear daughter, but find further truth. For the truth is eternal and as you seek this great gift of Love, so you too shall be eternal. Blessings to you, dear friends. My love is with you all upon the journey of discovery, awakening and transformation.
