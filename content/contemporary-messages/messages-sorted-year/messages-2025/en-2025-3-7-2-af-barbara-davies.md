Barbara Davies received by Al Fike

I am so happy to be with my beloved friends. I am Barbara. As you may have suspected, I have been with you for the whole time, enjoying your company and your conversations, reminiscing about the past, thinking about the future, praying to God, being with God and receiving this Love, this blessing.

I want you to consider how diverse the world is. Each of you has travelled and you understand this. You see the differences in the world. You have encountered many people who have different perspectives than you do. With this in mind, think of how God gathers the different colours into a rainbow, how beautiful that is and how, when you see that vision of a rainbow, all the colours come together in harmony. It is beautiful.

I would encourage you to accept the diversity of your community, all the different colours of that rainbow and how, when they are together in harmony, they create a beautiful vision of truth. For each one sees truth somewhat differently. Each one has a different hue of perspective and vision. Yet, when love is the foundation of your being and how you are in the world, then that love for another brings respect and harmony between you.

It is important to understand, because as this movement of love grows, there will be many different perspectives and many different individuals. It is a great gift to be able to harmonise and bring together these individuals into something that is beautiful. You have, for the most part, put aside your judgments and your fears. You want to love another, even when their perspective does not harmonise with your own. You realise that with love, you are not in disharmony. You may not agree mindfully with their perspectives regarding certain issues and material things, but when it comes to soul to soul, you are together. You are in harmony, for you both see, know and feel the Love of God that exists within one another.

This is the most crucial thing, to acknowledge that Love in another soul and to be loving toward that individual. Even when you encounter someone who does not have Love within their soul, this is not important, you must still love. Do not judge or be fearful. Be that light, that beautiful light of compassion and love. If the opportunity arises, be able to uphold and support that individual in love. This is what builds harmony in the world. This is how the rainbow of humanity may come together, not by distancing or judging, but by seeing and acknowledging that each soul is a living creation of God. As such, you honour God when you honour that individual. You honour God when you honour all of life.

I urge you to continue to seek out ways to love and to put aside any judgments you might have. When there are concerns, if you might intervene and assist in bringing greater harmony to a situation, then listen to your guidance. Listen to the wisdom of your soul. Most of all, listen and express that Love that abides within you. For with Love, all disharmony dissipates and becomes harmony, love and light.

Yet, often you concern yourselves with petty matters that really are not so important and not so crucial. Individuals in the world will be on their individual journey. People will follow their own perspective and their own way of expressing their lifves. It is not for you to judge. You may wish for something different, especially when you see that individual faltering or in pain because of their choices. That is the hardest thing to do, is it not, to see so clearly the error and yet still love, still accept that individual and still honour them.

This does not mean that you are turning a blind eye or that you are ignoring the pain and the suffering they are causing themselves. Yet, it is the faith that you might have in Love and the power of Love to change that individual. Change cannot happen without love. Change will not be accomplished without the expressions of love in patience, perseverance, acceptance and compassion. If you do not carry these things for another individual, then you are merely part of the human condition that continues to judge, condemn and perpetuate darkness.

This is not what you stand for. This is not what you pray for. I encourage you to look at each individual as a beautiful hue of God's great rainbow of life. To appreciate the uniqueness of an individualâ€™s soul,and see beyond the flaws, the pain and even the darkness, seeing a soul that is of light, struggling in the world. If you are that light and you are clear as a light, loving and accepting, then many who are struggling will be drawn to you. Many who are seeking will come to you. When you overshadow these things with judgment and fear, then that is all they will know and see within you. The attraction is broken, not because they have broken it, but because you have.

It is important to look within yourself, to search your own biases, your own fears and weed them out from your garden. That only love may exist there, that only the beauty and light of the purity of your soul may exist there and blossom in its unique way. You need to be aware of these things. For when you are purified of these things, when you reject the old patterns and old ways of being, then you make room. You make way for the soul's expression in all its beauty. You do God's work in a powerful and effective way.

God's work always begins with love. God's work is the expression and upliftment of love. You must be love, my beautiful friends. You must be love and move beyond anything that is not of love. I know how hard it is to do. I know that when I was on Earth, I had my own judgments and my own biases. Now, I see so differently. Now that I am a worthy inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom, that I have been purified of all of these things, I wish to share with you why it is important to let them go, so that you may put in the work and the effort to do so before you even enter into the spirit world. For it will put you in good stead. It will bring you to a beautiful habitation of light and love, joy and harmony.

This is what I want for each one of you. This is what I want for everyone in the world. For why suffer when you can be free? Why judge when you can love? Why get caught up and entangled in the human condition, when you can be in the harmony of God, with His Love pouring upon you and within you with every breath? This is what your souls seek. This is what, in many ways, you seek in your mind, but you get tripped up. You falter in those old patterns that are no longer truly a part of you. If you are to make a distance, distance yourself from the darkness that may still inhabit you. Distance yourself from the judgments and fears that still reside in the background of your existence. Put distance between you and darkness. You will find that the liberation and joy that comes will be tremendous, awesome and filled with joy.

I love you, my dear ones. I am Barbara. I love you so. I want only the highest and the best for each one of you. I dedicate myself to your progression, to cultivating and nurturing your light and to be at one with God, His Laws of Love. We continue on this journey together. How fortunate you are to have so many on my side of life who love you and who walk with you. You must and you will, in every way, grow and blossom in the purity of God's Love. God bless you, dear ones. God bless you.
