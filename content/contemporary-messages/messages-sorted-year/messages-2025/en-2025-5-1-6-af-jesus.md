# Your Light Draws Angels Close, Empowering Your Progress and Development

May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come, my beloveds. I am Jesus. I come as your brother and your friend. I come to pray with you. I come to be with you. I come because your light draws angels close and God's Holy Spirit upon your soul continues to bring this gift into you, brightening your soul, empowering your progress and development, bringing joy to your heart, bringing wisdom and deep understanding of spiritual truths and laws. All these things come because you have made a sincere effort to be with God and applied the Truth of His Love to your lives.

My beloveds, feel the inflowing of this Love, empowering your soul and its blessing, touching your spirit and bringing peace to your minds so that all is in harmony. All is within the grace of God. All is as it should be, my beloveds, for we continue upon this journey together that will continue for eternity. I walk with you. I am with you and my love for you is great. I too acknowledge your efforts. I too am pleased that you have come together in harmony and that you continue to pray together, creating a great light, a beautiful light, surrounding you and emanating from this Circle of Light out into the world, a light that we might utilise to touch other mortals and spirits who are in need and who seek truth.

You do the work, my beloveds. You shall continue in your efforts to serve God. I acknowledge each one of you and I love you dearly. We will continue upon this path of service, this path of truth. It shall bring many to you and you shall be guided toward many. It is God's Will and plan to bring light to the world and each of you are a part of it. Each of you must grasp your purpose and understanding of this part to play in the world. We are here to help you to understand. We are here to inspire and to guide. We are here to help you attune yourself to the revelations that God wishes to give to each one. We are here in love. That love grows. That bond continues to grow and deepen between us and you and through you to many. Continue in the work, beloveds. We will be with you always.

God bless you. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come on the wings of this light that you have created in your prayers. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
