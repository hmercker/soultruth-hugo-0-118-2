# Introduces Herself as Sonja’s Guide on her Birthday

January 17<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Isabel received by Al Fike

I come to you to acknowledge this dear child, this beautiful soul, for I am close to you, my beloved and beautiful friend. I guide you and I love you. I have been with you all your life. I have protected, influenced and been with you in every moment, for I am your guardian angel. I shall be with you all the days of your life. Indeed, I come to acknowledge you because I have the opportunity to speak. I come to encourage you to think of me.

My name is Isabel, and I come in love. I see the graciousness of your soul. I see your intentions and desires to serve in light and to help others. Your focus is always to help others, and you are humble and gracious in this way, though you do not see yourself in the light that you are truly in and express.

Yet, indeed, with the humility that you carry, and the grace of your life expressed, you are a beautiful soul, one who is remarkable in gifts and talents, one that is loving in many ways. As you support your family, as you embark upon a journey of service fulfilling your soul's purpose, the light will shine brighter, the way will be clearer, and the grace of God will be stronger.

As you seek out the realisation of your true being and what you are meant to do in this world, you have angels surrounding you and you are receptive to this. So, the gifts that God wishes to give to you, the blessings that are available to you, the beauty of God's Touch, His Hand upon you, is evident and will be a powerful catalyst and motivation for your efforts and your being, continuing to grow and progress as your soul is awakening. With this awakening will come the power and grace of your gifts, your light and your wisdom.

You will express these things in ways that others will understand and will be deeply moved by. They will flock to you for your what you would call down-to-earth wisdom. But, indeed, this down-to-earth wisdom is really that which emerges from your soul. It is truth. Truth is simple and truth is glorious.

God bless you, beloved soul. On this day, I recognise you in love. I acknowledge your efforts. It is and has been such a gift to be with you all this time. I honour you and I love you. I am Isabel and I love you. God bless you, beloved soul. God bless you. God bless you in love.

**Al’s comments after the prayer:** She had strawberry blonde, curly hair down to her shoulders. Amethyst blue eyes. Just gorgeous. With full lips. Just a beautiful, beautiful woman. Very willowy, kind of tall, with a flouncy gown on her. She is Celestial. I have never met her before. She must be European, I would think, based on the colouring. She’s white, very white, with strawberry blonde hair. So, Northern Europe? Maybe German? I don’t know.
