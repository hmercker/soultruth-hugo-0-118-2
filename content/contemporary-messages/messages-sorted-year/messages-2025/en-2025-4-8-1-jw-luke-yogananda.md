# Give the Gift of Prayer for God’s love

April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Nashville, TN, USA

Luke & Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the breath of God’s love be upon you. I am your brother in Christ, Luke.

(You may ask) how do we heal the world? Heal ourselves? Heal the planet? How do we move from so much negativity and inharmony to a condition of love? What currency do we trade in in a world full of material needs, material aspirations, material desires, and such inequality upon the earth? As you turn to God in prayer with deep desire, with deep longings from your soul, these questions that arise dissolve into truth. One begins to see with soulful perceptions, with a clarity that cuts through materialism because it is a clarity of soul. A soul with the love of God informing it, changing it, dwelling in it. One begins to be peaceful in a seemingly chaotic world. One begins to realize how much or how little they need; what is necessary.  Of course, I advise you, in spiritual terms, to trade in the currency of God’s love with each and every soul you encounter. Whatever your material status is, if you can help another by providing shelter, by providing food, and comfort, we encourage this. But, to simply ask *“May I have a prayer with you?”* And in this prayer, regardless of one’s beliefs or non-beliefs, of their faith, sect, or status on earth, when you include the simple prayer of asking God, our glorious Creator, to bestow the gift of love, which is the highest prayer, the highest intention, it brings the greatest gift.

So, whether you can help another materially, or psychologically, when you give the gift of love, when you teach another how to pray, 

> Dear God, I ask for your love to fill my soul. I give you my doubts, my concerns, my unforgiveness, my troubles, my worries, my anger, and my judgment that you may dissolve these barriers with your love. That your most holy spirit may bring this love, Your essence, into my soul. This I ask and pray that each one hungry may be filled, the lonely may feel the company of angels, and the sad may be uplifted in the true joy of Your presence. May this world receive this gift and be changed and may my world be changed. May any darkness I hold be brought into the light of Your love.

Any form of a prayer that asks God for love, Divine Love, is a sharing unequaled by any prayer book, any belief system, for it is a deed unrivaled; it is a wish for the highest and it is healing and freeing and eternal.

Be the blessing and blessed be the children. I am your brother and friend, in the love of God and I thank you. I am Luke the Physician and I love you. Go in peace.
 
I am here, your brother Yogananda. I wish to say a few things and I thank my brother Luke for his beautiful message. I wish to remind you that Master Jesus fed the hungry with physical food and soul food, that he gave up what one might consider a career as a carpenter to become a beggar, a wondering sadhu for the sake of others, reminding his followers ‘that he that gives up his life for me shall gain it as an eternal reward.’ So, I simply wish to say, that whatever you do for the sake of another, you will be rewarded tenfold. Give what you can, and you will receive much joy, not only on the earth but here in the heavens.

I thank you. I shall step back and I love you. I am your brother Yogananda, a follower of the Master and one with you in the love of God.
