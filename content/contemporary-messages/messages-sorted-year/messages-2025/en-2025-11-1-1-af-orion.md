Orion received by Al Fike

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. Your road continues to be paved in love, its way lit by God's blessings and Will. Each of you is obedient and eager to take this road, to live within the Truth and Laws of His Love. We walk forward together, for it is your willingness, your desire to be upon this road, that makes our communications possible, that brings our rapport close. Each of you is escorted by us, by the Celestial Angels, by the bright spirits. Many walk with you, my friends.

It is most certainly a road less travelled, but nonetheless, it is a road that needs to be travelled by all. You break the barriers. You are the first and the foremost. To explore the direction and experiences that this road will take, your soul is opening daily. Your experience is a reflection of your soul's awakenings and transformation. You are indeed coming into greater alignment with all these things that are a reflection of truth. Our wish is that this pace of development on this journey will quicken, so that when the time comes when you are needed, you will be thoroughly prepared and your feet upon this road will not wander but continue to be firmly planted thereon.

Be sensitive, my beloved friends, to the nuances, the subtleties, the experiences that come as you walk this road. Awareness is key. In this world of yours, being aware of these subtleties is difficult. You are often distracted. Your mind is playing its dominant role in your life. Yet, beneath this, is a soul most active and most aware. As we have told you many times, you must go beyond the mindful physical awareness and enter into soul consciousness. This step is most crucial. This need is most evident. For if you cannot truly align yourself to soul consciousness and recognise the difference between the material and the spiritual, then, the instruments we wish for you to be and that God intends will not be truly manifest.

You must see the world from that different perspective. It is one thing to travel the road. It is another to truly comprehend that travel. At the moment, the duality of both consciousness continues to be evident within you. For most of you, the consciousness of the material mind is your reality, is your focus and is your desire. Of course, you must navigate the material world, so there is a need to be in alignment with your material consciousness. Yet, you must practise flowing between the two, being comfortable in that flow and truly being in alignment with the reality of the soul. When you can do this with ease and walk with comfort in these two places, then you are truly ready for the next step, a step that will be a giant leap forward, a step that will take you into realms of consciousness, experiences and soulful awarenesses that will be truly astounding.

Many will want to know of your experiences, will want you to share them, to articulate what is happening to you. You will not be out and beyond the reach of humanity in this consciousness. Rather, you will be able to apply these things to everyday life, the wisdom, the loving expressions, the knowings and the feelings to your daily life. You will be living in two worlds simultaneously and, once adjusted to this, will be equally comfortable in both. You will receive much assistance and support in this, beloved souls. Though in the beginning, it will be disorienting and challenging, in time, as you continue to travel these two roads and merge them, you will become that new person, that individual who has made the transition, the transition that all on this world must make in time.

You will be the forerunners. You will be the examples. That experience and that transition will be unique to each individual, for your gifts and abilities to perceive and to experience soulful awareness will be a reflection of your unique selves. As a group, you add many beautiful perspectives and awarenesses that will help others to see. Those who are most in alignment with you will garner the most blessings and tutelage, reflecting your individual capacities and gifts.

Oh yes, there is much to do, my friends. You stand on the precipice of that great leap. Many of you hesitate. Many of you prefer the comfort of the tried and true, the familiar. You have fear regarding taking that first step, but indeed, we wait patiently. God waits patiently, knowing that as you continue to grow in this great gift of Love, you will garner the strength. You will have the impetus and the desire to leap forward and so you will. Our hope is that that time comes soon and that you are ready to make that great leap forward.

Time will tell, my friends. Time will tell. Remember that we are close and that as you take the risk and make that leap, there are many who are there to catch you and to uphold you. You are not alone, nor will you ever be. You will be loved and cared for. Even as the initial shock of this transition is with you, you will be upheld, not only by us but by your beloved friends who surround you in the flesh. Be brave, my beloved friends. Be sure of your footsteps and, with any leap, it is a leap of faith. Remember this, when you trust in God, trust in God's plan and Will for you, there cannot be any harm. There is only a period of adjustment, a period of acceptance. That is the worst of it, my beloved brothers and sisters. The rest will come easy, for your soul is well prepared and equipped to be within that reality, that conscious reality that comes with the soul, open, flourishing and aware in the Truth of Love.

We are with you, my friends. Indeed, Orion loves you so, precious and delicate creatures of Earth. We will surround you with love, protection, light and wisdom, as will many others. Be brave and be sure. Be truly committed to the awakening and transformation of your soul, and all else will follow in its stead. Truly, this must be the way, and it is the way.

God bless you, my beloved friends. Orion loves you. My delicate flowers, we anticipate the magnificence of your bloom, revealing the wonderment of your soul. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
