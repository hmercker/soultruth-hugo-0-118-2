# The True Church is in Your Hearts

May 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Peter received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Peter, sometimes called “the Rock”. My Master said he would build his church upon this Rock. I say to you, the true church is in your hearts. God's true church is in your hearts and your souls. You may build that church individually or together, but the Love is the church.

I am thankful for all that you have done here. I know this is a beginning. Each of you has your own beginning. There will be many followers. For what you do, you do in Love, in the Love that the Father gives to you. We will pray in your church whenever you ask us.

I am Peter. May God bless you always. With an open soul, may you accept these blessings.
