# Feel God's Love Flowing Into Your Soul Every Moment

April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Mary. As I birthed my son, I birth this new entrant into the Circle of Light, that she may be with us in every circle. In every loving moment, may she feel God's Love surrounding her, flowing into her soul.

May God bless you, child. May the Father walk with you in your soul from this day forward. As each of us and all of us possess His Love, His Essence, in our souls, making us brothers and sisters in truth, light and Love. **Our Father's Love fills the air, this atmosphere. The only challenge is to open and allow this Divine Love to come in.**

Pray with your souls wide open. Allow the Father's gifts to come in, for there are many here. My love is with you all. I am Mary.
