# Be Strong, Confident and Eager to Embrace a New World

February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

The world is about to open to you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. You are well aware and cognisant of the material world. It has been your reality for many years. Now a different world is about to open, a world that does not have the same markers as the material world, a world that is more fluid, a world that has within it great possibility of spiritual growth, learning and awareness.

A part of you, each one of you, is a bit reluctant to open that door. A part of you is eager to open that door. A part of you feels safer within the confines of a world that you are very familiar with. We help you to be strong, to be confident and to be eager. For only you can open that door, beloved souls. Only you are able to take in, absorb and embrace a different world, an awareness and reality that is needed in your world.

Through the ages, through the aeons of human existence, each has worked to crystallise and make solid the reality that you now experience in your everyday life. But, that crystallisation, that creation of the material world, is merely a figment of your mindful considerations combined with your material experiences and sensations. The mind has put together an elaborate reality. You all share this because humanity has created a very powerful wavelength, an existence of reality. You, indeed, participate in this with each day as you continue to receive and broadcast the thoughts and impulses of mortals upon the material world.

Now it is time to break open that mythological perception of reality. For that perception of reality and all that comes with it is conspiring to deplete the world of harmony, peace and vitality. There is certainly an absolute perception and reality that God has created that is your world, but you only glimpse this, beloved souls. You only see it through the eyes and filters of the mind. Our hope is that you will see it beyond those filters and beyond that mind to the mind of the soul and the openness of the soul. As you go through these exercises and make efforts to awaken to a different reality, then you are contributing to the revolution that is at hand, the revolution of insight and the recalibration of reality that every individual must go through upon your planet.

In times to come, conditions will force your brothers and sisters to look beyond these things. It is far easier to do so now through your own volition to see than it will be under the pressures and circumstances that are coming in the material world. When that time comes, our hope is that you will be prepared. You will be open and considerate of these things. In this openness and consideration, you will have wisdom and strength to share with your brothers and sisters what is truly happening upon this world of yours.

We are there to help you. We wish to communicate with you in a full and rich way so that we are as one, you upon the Earth and we in the Celestial Spheres, the bright spirits in the higher spheres and even your stellar friends, all collaborating together to help birth humanity into a new reality, a shift of consciousness, a shift of perception. So you try, you yearn, you pray and you make effort to see, to look, to accept and not to be fearful, judgmental or skeptical, but to encourage that innocence of the soul to be aware truly and to be open to what God wishes to give to each one of you so that, in time, the entire mass of humanity will find their way to a new world, a new perception of that world and a new way of being within that world.

It is a great plan and a complex one. It is important for each of you to find your way within it, to truly be alive within it and an active agent for God, to bring about the changes that are necessary. So, you continue to fumble about. Often, you feel unprepared and not very confident in your experiences and perceptions. Yet, the more that you enter into this space, this place, this perception, this grace of God, the easier it will be for you to accept it and to embrace it. Putting practice to your desires to be open and cognisant of these communications and experiences is most important at this time.

Beloved souls, we are giving, God is giving, all that you require to open yourself in this way. Indeed, the old habits reinforce the wavelength, the perception of the old reality. You must challenge this. You must exert yourself in a way that does not feed and reinforce these things of the old ways. Instead, have faith and eagerness to be with God, with your own soul and with us in this new way, this new reality, this new world. You will find fulfilment and joy in this. You will find extraordinary experiences, perceptions and wisdom.

You will learn to love the new way, for the new way is full of love, full of love and the grace of God. It comes to all humanity, but to you, it is coming in a more forceful and beautiful way. The power of God's Touch upon you is great, beloved souls. Feel it, absorb it, embrace it and you will find your way on the path that I have described. You will know yourself within the reality of this path of God's new world. It will be glorious, beautiful and fulfilling.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I encourage you forward, beautiful students of truth, beautiful, gifted souls of God's great creation. We travel together, each day a new blessing and a new challenge. May you, indeed, find the joy and the wonderment that God has bestowed upon you in Love. God bless you, beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am encouraged by your efforts. I encourage you further upon the path. God bless you. God bless you in His Love.
