# The New Way

June 19<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Baptist. Discipline is part of this life upon the Earth: disciplining thoughts, disciplining actions, making choices that are the highest and best. I know it is a challenge. Yet you have so much help, so many blessings and such truth within you. Discipline yourselves so that your soul is speaking to you and you, as soul, are understanding what is being told to you. Be in that place where your mind awaits the soul’s directions and applies what soul is giving to it.

Yes, at this point, it requires discipline on your part. I knew well how to discipline myself, but I did not have all the blessings that you souls have as you walk this Earth. Mine was a discipline of the mind: strict, unyielding, not the true discipline of love. Mind you, I came with a purpose and I did fulfil that purpose. When my brother, my Master, my cousin, came, I knew my purpose had been fulfilled. He brought a greater Truth, a greater way of being upon this Earth. I did not possess what he possessed. He was the New Way. I was the old way.

The old way is very different. Many people, even today, still rely on the old way. But the New Way—the way of Love, the path that brings you eternal Love—this New Way is completely different from the old way. It is not based upon discipline of the mind. It is based upon the expression of the Love within your souls and continuing to receive that Love that is everlasting and infinite. This is the New Way. This is what my Master taught and now that is my way as well, as I live in the Celestial Heavens with my brothers and sisters who obtain this Love and receive such amounts of it that they are souls, complete, totally soul, and that soul is Love.

Now, I say to you, you have a choice. You can choose the discipline of the mind, as I did when I lived on the Earth, or you can choose the discipline of Love. Our Father offers you this choice. When you choose, open your souls and allow God to help you in your progression, every moment of your existence.

I am your brother, John the Baptist. It is my enjoyment to come and speak to you today. My love has grown. I love you all with such an intensity and I express that love to each one of you in this circle. May you be open to receiving it. May God bless you ever so much more. God bless you. We will be with you to pray with you. We are coming closer because you are open to receiving our love and our ministrations. God bless you.
