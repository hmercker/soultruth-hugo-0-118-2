Orion received by Al Fike

â€¦ be yours, beautiful friends. I am Orion. The blessings of a soul yearning for God. This is given freely. Whenever you ask, you shall receive. The blessings of the flesh and the material plane, the wonderment of God's creation all around you. This is given freely. The blessings of the mind and spirit, engaged in appreciation, creativity and all good things within you, express through you. This is given as a gift to you and may be expressed freely. There is so much that God has given to you in your lives that is of great value and blessings. Whether you are rich or poor, whether you are downcast or uplifted, these blessings are available to each and every soul, provided they choose to engage within them, to appreciate them and to be joyful in this appreciation.

Yes, so much God gives freely to his children. I have been with this instrument while he toils in his garden and how he appreciates nature rising up in the spring, greeting him with life and beauty. In this simple service to God and to his garden, there is much joy. For some of you, it is in your relationships with your brothers and sisters, acknowledging your life and aliveness in the world. For some, it is in the creative acts that bring about beauty. These things rise up from the soul and are a wonderful manifestation of what God has created within you.

Oh, the many ways and means one can engage in life, engage in the wonderment of life and all its pleasures, engage in all the layers and levels of life in all its intricacy and beauty. Indeed, we encourage you to be engaged. Do not worry and fret about various material concerns and obstructions, though there certainly is time and requirement for this if it is done in faith and lack of concern. Yet, even in this, joy can enter within it. For when you live a joyful life, a life that is resplendent in the beauty of God's creation, then these conditions, these worrisome conditions, are less burdensome and less difficult, because joy overshadows all. Love is the touchstone of all.

We encourage you to continue in your pursuit of joy, pursuit of love and pursuit of the appreciation and perception of the wonderment which is God's creation and the wonderment which is of your own creation. These things in harmony with God's Laws continue to bring fulfilment and continue to nurture you. All things of God, all the goodness, all the wonderment, all the beauty, all the creativity and all the joy, this is what is meant for humanity. This is what we wish for you to live within and to express within the parameters of God's great creation.

If you can do this, if you are willing to open yourself fully to these things of light, then there is no more pain. There may be observation and perception of conditions and situations that surround you, but with joy washing over your perceptions and your experiences in life, the pain lessens until it is no more. It is not that you release all care and concern for your brothers and sisters. Rather, with joy, you become a channel, an instrument for healing and upliftment, to give people hope and to inspire them toward that which you have and that which you express.

Make those choices, beautiful friends, toward the wonderment, the pleasures, the depth and breadth of God's creation in all its beauty. You will be happy, fulfilled and you will see truly the meaning for life, which is to know joy, which is to engage in life, to engage in God's creation and to engage one another in love. These things come on the heels of the soul awakening in the Love of God. These things come because God makes it possible for you to see and perceive, to experience and to feel all that which is of light.

My beloved friends, we join you in celebrating life and acknowledging light, goodness and creation, and acknowledging the beauty that is your creation and God's creation of you. How bold and wonderful is it that you exist, and you are a creative force unto yourself, that your soul, continuing to be infilling with God's Love, will be an ever greater force of light. How wonderful this is. Progress, ever moving forward. Creativity, ever expanding. Joy and love, deepening and growing within you. Beautiful children of God, I am your brother, and I share in the joy. I share in the experience. I share in my acknowledgement and your acknowledgement of our Creator. You are blessed as we are blessed. You are alive as we are alive. We are joyed as you are joyed in the aliveness of life.

God bless you all. I am Orion and I love you. I have great joy in acknowledging and seeing your beauty, the wonderment of your unique creation and to accompany you at times in this beautiful, wondrous Earth of yours in all its versatility, all its aliveness and all its beauty. God bless you, my friends. My love is with you always and evermore. God bless you.
