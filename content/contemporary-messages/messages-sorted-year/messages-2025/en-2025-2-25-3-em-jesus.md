Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I am your brother and your friend and the Master of the Celestial Heavens. I am Jesus. I come to bring you gifts from my Father. Love from God pours into your souls and many other blessings are now descending upon you. May you open your souls so very deeply and widely. Allow our Father's blessings to touch you, to ring true and to develop in your souls.

My Father has sent me to bless you. With the Love in my soul, which is mighty, I give you my love and my promise to be with you all the days of your lives as you walk this path toward our Father. This is my promise to you and my blessing to you, each one. May God bless you continuously throughout your lives on this path.

You are so very dear to me, so precious in God's eyes and so loved. Each one of you, come to know this truth. Bring it in deeply and let it develop within you, this truth that you are loved by God.

God bless you, true children of God. I am your brother, Jesus.
