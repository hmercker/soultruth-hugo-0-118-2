# Drink of the Living Waters

September 30<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

My beloveds, I come. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you and to be with you in the light of our Heavenly Father's Love, to bask in that Light, to bask in that blessing, to be refreshed by God's Touch.

Open yourselves completely to God, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. As you open your soul wide, drink of these Living Waters, drink of this blessing, so that you may truly feel the empowerment of your soul awakening to all the glories and blessings that God has to give to you. His Touch is freely given, all you need do but ask. Ask with desire and intention, ask with sincerity and honesty and all that is of God shall be given to you as you are able to receive it and to know it.

Each of you are my brothers and sisters and I am your eldest brother. I walk with you. I honour you. I love you. Together, we shall find and truly be within the Kingdom of Heaven. This is my promise, that I shall lead you there, beloved souls, lead you to those gates that shall ensure eternal life. The Father's Love shall truly transform you, that the grace of His Touch shall uplift you, that within is a joy that wells up and it may be expressed in all that you are and all that you do. For it is joy of the soul that shall bring light to the world. It is the power of God's Love that shall open the door to the expression of all that you are, my beloveds, a soul awakened, transformed by our Heavenly Father's Touch.

My beloveds, shall we journey together into that Hall of Peace, have some respite within the light that is shed there and acknowledge our souls, our true selves and be with God in that acknowledgement, in that place of peace? God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother and your friend. I am Jesus and I love you, each one precious to my heart, each one truly a part of my family. I shall watch over you, protect you and pray with you as you journey on this Earth plane and beyond. God bless you, my beloveds, my love is with you always. God bless you.
