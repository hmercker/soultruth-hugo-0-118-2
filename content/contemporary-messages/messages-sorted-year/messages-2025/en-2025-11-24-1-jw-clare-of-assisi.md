# Reluctance and Courage

November 24<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Nashville, TN, USA

Clare of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

Brothers and sisters, it is I, Clare.

I wish to speak about reluctance and gravity. First and foremost, as the faith that comes with your prayers encourages one to step forward, the word courage becomes a reality. How you wish to step forward in any given moment is determined by the situation that presents itself and the guidance that you feel in your soul. For there are your plans and then there is God’s plan. When these two things are in harmony, blessings occur.

One constantly struggles on earth with the heaviness of the vibrations, with the gravity of situations, with the news, with things that you seem to have no control over. And yet, as I have said through this one before, Divine Love is anti-gravitational. You know, when you see a situation from above and, in your case, let us say, from a higher floor of a building looking down at what is occurring at street-level, you have the bigger picture, and so it is with God’s love, which allows you to see the bigger picture in any given situation.

My sisters and I on earth we felt it necessary to remove ourselves, as did our brother Francis, from the hustle and bustle of our world.  We found this wonderful gift, silence, prayer, song, all of these things allowing us, if I may say, to see above the dogmatic nature of our order, to feel the riches of the grace of God, and when we did venture out, we sometimes felt like we were walking on air, our hearts full of compassion and willing to serve. And I will also say that our prayers gave us a protective bubble, keeping us from harm, from the vexations around us, inharmonious spirits, and the judgment of others. At some point, the love of God that we carried was undeniable, and the desire to be in God’s grace was fulfilled. So, you know, despite what anyone might believe in error in terms of religious beliefs, political beliefs, the gift of God’s love is transcendent, and when asked for, it is given to all, regardless of their beliefs, regardless of their mindful errors. Knowing this, we were able to reach many souls, and the sisterhood that became The Poor Claires still reaches out to many in many places, and I watch over my sisters with the love of God and influence them as best I can.

You, dear ones, have been blessed with the great truths of the gospel of Master Jesus and the efficacy of prayer life awakening your souls, lifting you above the world, and at the same time, opening your heart to it. This is a wonderful thing. How we love your prayer circles, your retreats, your coming together in community, despite your differences, and now even where you may reside, in what part of the earth. For there is truly oneness on this path in the love of God.

Let the gratitude’s of the heart bring forth the gift of every soul. May your gift of the love of God touch every soul, and the many gifts that come with that great gift draw unto you all those seeking this love.

I shall step back, and I thank my brother for taking this message, and I thank all of you here for your prayers, for the sincere longing of your souls, and for your faith, ever-growing.

May the love of God be upon you, and His holy spirit bring His love into every soul here. God bless you.

I am Clare, once of Assisi, now an inhabitant of the celestial kingdom and your friend.
