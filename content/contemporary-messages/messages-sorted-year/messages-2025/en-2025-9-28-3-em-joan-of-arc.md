# God's Intention for His Children

September 28<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Beams of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am with you now. I am Joan of Arc. I come close to you today to bring joy into your midst and to bring courage, courage of your convictions to love God with your whole heart, your whole soul and your whole being. In this way, your love touches God's Soul and God quickly and immediately responds with His Love and other blessings flowing into your souls.

Be open, dear children of God. Be open to receive the Love and manifest your faith, for the Father has much to give you and much to bless you with. We are truly at one at this time, brothers and sisters upon the Earth, in the flesh, in this circle, brothers and sisters in the spirit world, who join us and pray with us, all of us who come from the Celestial Kingdom surrounding you, protecting you, loving you and, all together, receiving the blessings that our Creator is pouring down upon us at this time.

Be true to your souls. This is what God intends for each and every soul, this communion, the sharing of Love between His Soul and your soul. Allow His Love to come in deeper, wider and more completely. Know that this is your heritage, your future and your goal to be this content, joyful and steadfast in this Love.

No love is greater. So drink up, dear ones, and hold fast to the Father's Love. I am with you. You may call upon me to pray with you at any time, to assist you whenever you are in need. I am your sister, Joan, and I love you with a love that will never erode. God bless you, dear children of God. We love you so much. God bless you.
