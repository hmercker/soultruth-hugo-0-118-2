# The Ways of Love in God's Service

Orion received by Al Fike

The Essence of the Creator is indeed flowing into your souls, my friends. It is Orion. As you are transformed by this gift, as you receive more truth and integrate and absorb truth, it is common to feel separate from humanity. For is this not why God has brought you together for this fellowship, to share the experiences, the perceptions and all that comes with this gift of Love with one another?

I urge you to support one another in loving and graceful ways. For as the world changes and as you change, this feeling of separation will intensify. There will be a sense of detachment. There will be a sense of compassion for the world, but not a need to rescue and to change the world, for that will be God's plan in doing so. Your part in this plan will be to listen and be guided. When you are somewhat detached, you are a more clear channel in the process of service. When you become emotionally involved with all the wrongdoings, the difficulties and the injustices in the world, your reactions add fuel to the fire. Instead, if you are a loving soul, a light in the world, a fount of wisdom and compassion, then you will be a clear channel for God and those who are lost and seeking will seek you out. The Laws of Attraction work in this way and to your favour.

Each of you is being prepared, educated, guided and transformed in Love. All the goodness, all the wonderment of the universe, is at your disposal. Indeed, it is not because you are someone special or especially designated to be favoured in this way. Rather, it is your desire, the desires of your soul, that bring you into the alignment, into the connection and into all that is interconnected with the truths of your creation, with the existence of God as a palpable relationship in your life, the light that pours upon you, the peace that is yours, the understanding that comes with a soul awakening and able to perceive the truth. All the details, snippets of information, of perception, of experience, coalesce together and make you a being of light.

We wish to encourage you upon the path that does have a price to pay. That feeling of difference, that feeling of detachment, that feeling that you do not belong, is all part of the journey. Yet, overshadowing these things is a profound sense of love and compassion for humanity, not in a way that you are superior, for with this compassion comes humility, but in a way that you see the suffering that humanity creates for itself. You have the wisdom to understand why so many are victimised and so many victimise themselves, because the foundation in which humanity sees the world, understands their purpose in the world, is corrupted and in darkness. How can you not have compassion for those who walk blindly in the darkness, who do not truly understand who they are, do not truly understand the beautiful gifts and beings that they are, that God created.

When you are a light and when you walk in the world as a light, do not seek to change the world, but seek to be a light. For those who come close, seek to be a channel of love, without judgement and without biases, merely love. This is how the world will be changed, not by your pontificating and preaching to others the truth. Rather, it is your loving compassion and your simple and wise words that reflect the truth. When you are that individual, and indeed you have this capacity, each one of you, then God will use you in powerful ways to help neutralise the darkness, to help bring truth to others and to bring comfort to many. Yet, you must choose, my beautiful friends, how you will utilise what God has given you, how you will be in the world and how you will respond to the world, that joyful interaction with others and that simple compassion and service to others.

At times, words profound and powerful come through your lips. There are many ways you can serve God and serve humanity. Yet, first and foremost, you must serve your own personal progression, bringing your soul close to God and living that soulful journey of awakening. If you are able to do this and to be receptive and open to the opportunities for service that God lays before you, then it will be a rich and fulfilling life, a life certainly that travels upon a path that is not usual, but a life that will be a clear example and demonstration of the power of the transformative Love of Godâ€™s Soul infused into your soul. Yes, God has many plans and much purposeful guidance for each of you, but you must be grounded in love, in the simplicity of love, in the power of love, in the compassion that love gives to your being, your perception and your understanding of the world.

When you can be this light, compassionate soul, beautiful channel of love, then you are truly walking the path you are destined to walk. In this, all other things fall into place. You will come to know us as clearly as you know your brothers and sisters on Earth. You will come to work with us, your angel friends and bright spirits in many ways. Those ways will often be surprising and most certainly creative and beautiful. These are the ways of the servants of God. You must tread with wisdom, understanding, self-compassion, and love and compassion for others.

My beloved friends, the world awaits your light, your being, the expression of your soul touched deeply with the Divine Love. Walk forward, my friends, upon that path of service. All the things that we have spoken of, all the truths that have been shared, all that is truly you, will manifest in your life, not by the grinding and difficult ways that the human mind creates and calls progress, but by the expression and transformation that comes to the soul, as you seek your relationship with God. That flow of Love, that awakening, comes readily when you continue to pray earnestly for the great gift of God's Love.

May you find your way, my friends. You continue on the path and shall continue forever. We are with you on that journey and our compassion and love for you is great. Many surround you with great love. Be that light, my beloved friends. Be that truth. Most of all, be an expression of Divine Love within your soul. God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. I love you so. God bless you.
