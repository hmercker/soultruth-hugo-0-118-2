# Auspicious Blessings of God’s Love for a Great Number of Souls on Both Sides of the Veil

January 21<sup>st</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Jesus & Bartholomew received by Al Fike

**Jesus:** Children of God, I come. I am Jesus. I come to be with you on this auspicious day as you gather seeking the great gift of the Father's Love. I come to bless you and to be with you in love. I come to bless all the spirits that have gathered around, all who are seeking, all your ancestors from this island and many more.

For how many times and opportunities are there for these seeking souls to be a part of such a Circle of Light? How many blessings come when God brings His angels forth to help uplift and bless those who are lost and those who are seeking? These blessings not only go out to your spirit friends, but they go out into your world, to your loved ones, to those who have recently passed and to those who are related to each one of you.

This occasion is auspicious, for a great number have gathered and a great light has manifested. I come to assure those who witness this that the Truth lies in the Love of God, accepted and embraced. The great blessing of His Love shall transform and awaken you into light. You will know the peace that you so desire, my beloveds. You will know the strength, beauty, depth and breadth of this blessing of Love from God's Soul to yours, as the Holy Spirit conveys this gift.

I acknowledge my brothers and sisters upon the Earth plane, their dedication and time set forth to allow these blessings to flow, to allow the angels to make their presence known and to bring all of us together in a unified light. The great ring, the golden ring, circulates and bonds you all in love. The flow of light, peace and love is great. It ripples forth in your world and the Spirit World. It brings the blessings of God, amplified by your instrumentalities and ours together in a unified force that is rarely seen upon this earthly plane.

The entire world benefits from our presence and yours, seeking the blessings of God to flow, to pour upon us and through us out into the world.  Ask for this great blessing, all souls present. Open and ask that God may put within your soul His Essence that is His Love. It brings the peace that passes all understanding. It pours into those places that are wounded and in pain. It makes your soul come to a place that is whole and at peace.

My beloved, beautiful friends, this is my teaching. It shall continue to touch many souls as those of you on Earth and those in the Spirit World set forth to be God's instruments of Truth and my disciples. You are deeply blessed and shall continue to be blessed as you gather. You shall bring a change within yourself and a change within the world that shall be permanent and powerful. For this light, given, has great power and beauty, a great source of blessings. It shall be utilised in the world in many ways and bless many different souls, both in Spirit and in the flesh.

Your very presence here, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, is most welcome and powerful in what is given and what shall come. Open your souls wide. Put aside any doubts and reticence. Set forth in faith and awaken to the truth that God loves you beyond measure and is here to fully bless you.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come because I love you, because I love the world, because I love all souls that God has created. So, we come in Love, and we are in Love, the eternal Love, the blessed Love, the holy Love of God. God bless you. I am here with you in prayer and shall give each one a blessing. God bless you, beloved souls.

**Bartholomew:** This is an auspicious occasion, my beloved friends. I am Bartholomew. For Jesus has come and shown himself to many and many have been touched deeply by his presence. This has been made possible by your efforts and the efforts of your angel friends who come to reinforce this condition that allows such vision and such a blessing for many.

It is an auspicious beginning to a time together where we will manifest many things and bring many blessings to each one of you. I urge you to be consistent and to be present in these times, for each carries a beautiful light. Each will do their part, and each will be blessed accordingly.

The beloved Master has given each of you a blessing to encourage you along the road and to help you in this special time together. Be open and receptive. Put aside the earthly life for some moments together. Be with your Creator, acknowledging and dedicating yourself, for God has much to give to you, many blessings to flow. Be open, receptive and have great faith and gratitude for what is given so freely and abundantly to each of you.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Bartholomew. I am most happy that you have gathered and have been able to accomplish something important today, a deep blessing for many. You have truly been servants of God on this day and shall continue to do so on subsequent days. God bless you and keep you. I have great love for each one of you and deep respect for your efforts, your tenacity and your light. God bless you. God bless you.

**Jesus (returning):** Your spirit and your soul, all of you, is blessed on this day to uplift you and sustain you, to awaken you and to infill you with the blessings of God, given to you in Love, honouring of your presence and your dedications. All this is given in Love, freely and abundantly.

God bless you. I am Jesus and I bless you, beloved souls.
