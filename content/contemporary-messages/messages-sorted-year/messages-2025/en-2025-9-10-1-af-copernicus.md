# The Truth of the Mind Will Only Bring You So Far

September 10<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Copernicus received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my friends. I am Copernicus. I am happy that you are enjoying the part of the world that I walked when I was in the flesh. I am happy to see these two young men who are eager to know the truth and to live the truth. I am happy to be in a Circle of Light such as this. I am a Celestial Angel. I have been for some time. Like any pursuit, when I discovered the way of Divine Love, I was focused and I progressed quickly. I am happy to be with you.

Dear son (A), to my right, I am one of your guides. I want you to know this. Indeed, you have a keen mind and you enjoy analysing situations, conditions and problems. I help you with this. I am happy to help you, dear son. I only caution that you do not let your mind run away with you, for it tends to go into directions that are not productive, as you would say. It is important that you seek the soul and the soul's perceptions. Believe me when I say that the soul is able to understand truth far better than the mind. The mind and its limitations are great, even a mind such as mine, which discerned many things to be true. Once I realised the capacities of the soul to understand truth, I never looked back. I became a very happy spirit, enthralled with the notions of soul, seeking ever more of the experience of soul.

I encourage each one of you, whether you are an intellectual or whether you continue to feel and experience life in other ways, to seek out the soul, to seek out its wonders, its gifts and abilities. That is ignited by the gift of God’s Love. This is the primary effort you must make, to pray for this great gift, to seek it out with earnestness and desire and to seek it often. For you can never get enough of this gift. Indeed, I continue to progress in the Celestial Kingdom in my pursuits and desires for truth and for the great experience of God’s Love that, in turn, ignites many other experiences and truths.

Many of you are curious and desire deeper and greater truth. Yet, without this development of soul, without the wisdom of soul and the perceptions of soul, you will not know them. You can only know the limitations of the mind and its ability to discern what you would call truth. Yet, that truth of the mind is limited and may only bring you so far in your pursuit. Truth of the soul is multifaceted and it expands outward and inward. It is a way of being and knowing that is not possible through linear thought. For within truth discovered by the soul are the feelings of truth, the perceptions of truth, the knowings of truth and the discernment of truth. All of this comes as your souls, the window of your soul, opens to all that God is and all that God created. You must see through the eyes of your soul and know through the knowings of your soul if you are truly to understand truth.

I urge you along the path. Indeed, you must lay a great and beautiful foundation that will have the capacity to absorb truth, absorb love and absorb light. In this you will know great joy, great understanding and great capacity to love. It all awaits each of you, for you have tasted this truth. You know it to a degree, but you must truly be immersed in it to understand the way I understand, to have the experiences that I have had, to walk the path as I have walked. It is important for you to be humble, eager and desire the truth with an intensity that will open the floodgates of God’s Love and awaken you to all that is of your soul.

May you be blessed, my beautiful friends. I am Copernicus. I love you all, budding and bright lights, seeking all there is to seek, knowing all there is to know, experiencing all that is of God. These things await you. It shall be gifted to you in accordance to your capacity to accept and to desire and to be open to all that there is and all that there shall be in the universe. Blessings to you, beautiful friends. My love is with you all. God bless you.
