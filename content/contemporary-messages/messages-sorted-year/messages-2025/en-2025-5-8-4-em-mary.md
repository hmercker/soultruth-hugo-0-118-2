Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Mary. Know that we will be with you. You will be cradled in our arms as you go in your different directions to your homes. You will be safe. You will be protected. For the Love of God is within your souls and we are charged with assisting you and ensuring your safety.

Be aware of those souls you pass. Send them your love. Touch them with your souls that they may have an opening into which God may give blessings. We are with you, dear children. We are with you and always will be with you.

May God bless you. I am Mary.
