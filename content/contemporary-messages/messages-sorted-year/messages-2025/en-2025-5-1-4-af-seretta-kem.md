# The Need to Create a Strong Foundation and Follow God's Will

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

May you have different ears to hear, my beloveds, different eyes to see and different faculties to understand. We are here together to help you develop these faculties, this way of hearing, knowing and seeing. We are diligent in our efforts to help you in this regard. I am Seretta Kem. We continue upon this journey together so that you may become effective instruments of God's Will and God's plan to bring humanity to truth, to love and to light.

First, you must yourself come to truth, to love and to light. You must develop within you such a strong foundation and all that is built upon it must be in harmony with the Laws of Love. When you are in that place of harmony, when you walk that road listening with your new ears to the Will of God, when you see before you with your new eyes the steps you must take, when you understand, when you are close to us and close to God, the Truth that comes with God's Touch and our presence, when these things are well in place, when you do not doubt or are in confusion, when you are strong and steadfast in the truth, when you put aside your own will and adopt the Will of God, when you are a channel of love, not allowing judgement or negativity to enter into your thoughts or your interactions with others, when you are in the purity of God's Love, then you are ready to go out into the world and be God's agent of truth, love and light.

At times, I know you believe within your mind that you are ready, that you have all that you need and that you have realised all the requisites of your endeavours and what is required of you. Yet, often this assessment comes from the mind and your desire to be empowered as an instrument of God. That desire comes from the mind as well. Yet, when you are ready, my beautiful, beloved friends, you will know it. You will feel it. You will see it. You will understand that, indeed, as you step forward, you are well-prepared and you feel the impetus of the soul awakening and hearing the Will of God manifest not through your mental reckonings, your ideas and projections, but through the truth that resides within and through the understanding that comes from a soul connected and in harmony with its Creator.

These things we have told you many times, we have encouraged you many times. We have spoken of it many times in order for you to have clarity, to understand the barriers in your way and the possibilities that exist as you continue to go beyond those barriers, to release the impediments, to be true to the burning light and desire of your soul to serve God and to serve humanity. My beloved friends, you come close. You come close. Indeed, the greatest barrier to you at this time is the exercise of your free will urging you in the opposite direction of that which your soul wishes to go. Be aware of this, those contradictions within you, those unfortunate misunderstandings, fears and desires that continue to be counterproductive in your journey to develop as God's instruments.

We are there to help you see, to hear and to know. We add our gifts to yours at times so that you may understand and that you may experience that which is an impediment or that which is truly some guidance given. We are there and shall always be there. You continue to move forward and to be that instrument that you so desire to be, that God has placed within you a great purpose, a great destiny. Indeed, how you utilise this gift of free will is crucial at this time, so that you may indeed be in harmony, be on the road of harmony, to listen, to see and to know all that is required, so that you may serve God to the highest and best of your ability.

You continue to grow, my beautiful friends. We continue to walk with you. You will someday be that bright and shining light, that pure and beautiful soul that will know the Will of God with no hesitation, no misunderstanding, but with a clarity and a purposeful awareness of what you must do and where you must go. It comes in its own time. It comes determined by your sense of timing and your will, but it is inevitable that it will come. You will be on the road of great service. Many beautiful outcomes, blessings and results of your endeavours will be in alignment with God's plan to bring humanity back to light and harmony.

May you be blessed, my beautiful friends. I am Seretta Kem. I come once again to encourage you and to guide you. God bless you. My love is with you, beautiful souls, children of God. God bless you.
