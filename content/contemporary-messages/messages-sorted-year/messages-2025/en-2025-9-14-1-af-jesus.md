# We Will Always Be with You

September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloveds, I am Jesus. I come to bring the blessings of our Heavenly Father to you. I come to acknowledge each one of you, that indeed within your hearts burns a fire of desire to receive the gift of God's Love. As you tend to that flame, I urge you to continue to seek out more of that great blessing.

Know that we have been with you, that we continue to guide you and we will not forsake you. As you continue to abide by the will of your soul, the desires of your soul to be with God, we will abide with you. We will pray with you. We will help to uplift you and protect you, for we are our Heavenly Father's servants. As such, we are a part of God's Will and desire to uphold you and to love you.

May you be blessed, beloveds, upon the path of soul awakening. May you now come to know your true selves and come to be in the light of truth. My love is with you. May the Father's Love continue to flow within you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to acknowledge you and to thank you for the time you have spent together in prayer, in learning, in sharing and loving. These things help to bolster the soul in its quest for at-onement with God. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
