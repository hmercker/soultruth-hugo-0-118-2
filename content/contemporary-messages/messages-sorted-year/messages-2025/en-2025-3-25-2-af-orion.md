# Be a Light in the Dark Conditions that Assail You

Orion received by Al Fike

My friends, Orion comes once again to help uplift you, to teach you and to inspire you. I am not the only one, as you are well aware, only one of many, many who come and gather around you in the light and beauty of your soul's longing, desiring truth, thirsting for Love and seeking light to be with you. God continues to answer your prayers, your desires and your choices as you live in this world that is often so disharmonious.

In the disharmonious conditions that are all around you, I urge you not to judge, even though all around you may be judgement and there may be anger and fits of dis-ease and difficulties. My beloveds, each of you are tested in these conditions, the strengthening of the steel in fire, the resolve of your choice and will in difficult conditions, in the darkness. These things are always around you, beloved souls. There are often situations that bring your attention toward these conditions. I urge you to be at peace, to allow negativity to roll off you and away from you and to be in the light. For without this resolve and this desire, you will always be a victim of outside forces and conditions, so much of which you have no control over. In terms of your reaction, if it is a reaction of judgement, distaste or lack of love, then you must respond with light, love and compassion.

For as your beautiful brother Jesus said, “Father, they know not what they do.” Indeed, this is often the case. They are ignorant of their own misdeeds and conditions. They do not wish to look. They do not wish to change. As such, what can you do but have a prayer for those individuals and have compassion for the conditions that they are building within them, conditions that eventually must be resolved. You know your own struggles, how you have worked so diligently to resolve conditions within you. They, in their turn, will be obligated to resolve conditions that they have created, absorbed and then manifested.

My beloved friends, can you imagine what we observe in the world, and we observe even within you? If we were to judge, if we were to withhold and turn our gaze away from you, how would you feel? How bereft would you be without the help and support of our efforts, our light and our love? It is not that you are alone, and it is not that you are even perfect, but it is the case that you are struggling and make great effort to be in relationship with your Creator, with all the beautiful and bright spirits, angels and stellar friends that surround you and with God, your Creator. In this, you bring the highest, most beautiful conditions to help you and uplift you and when, in stark contrast, you see what is around you, you begin to appreciate what is given.

This does not mean that each of you are free of conditions that are not in harmony with God's Laws of Love, for you are still human. These conditions are less so within you than in many. With the help that is around you, you feel uplifted and often judge yourself as being free of the darkness. For the most part you are, my friends, but there are crevices, nooks and crannies within you that continue to harbour that which is destructive and not in harmony with a soul that desires to be transformed and redeemed in Love.

Have compassion for yourselves and be wise, knowing that you too are in need of more of God's blessings, more awareness in truth, more upliftment and less of those conditions that bring pain. You are the fortunate ones, indeed, who know of the redemptive qualities of God's Love and all that comes with it. You are changing with each day. You choose for a higher outcome as you confront these conditions that are difficult. You are loved and you know it. Truly, within your heart, you know how much you are loved. I want you to exercise in your heart that feeling of love for your brothers and sisters, for those you love, those who are close. In this way, you negate any other conditions that are not of love. In this way, you open the door for deeper connection and the flow of blessings of love for those you are with.

I know it is difficult. I know that there are parts of you that reflectively react and are often disillusioned, even angry, with the conditions that you witness with others, with the conditions of the world that seem to be worsening and turning into levels of chaos and dysfunction that take your breath away. Can you still love in these conditions? Can you still feel the joy? I know, and it is understandable, that you often retreat into your own loving condition, removed from these human conditions. This is often necessary to replenish. You come here in this group and other groups to do so. This is a strength and a blessing when you choose this.

Yet, you also must venture out into the world. If you are always isolated, always immune from these conditions, then the steel cannot be tempered. It is soft, malleable and vulnerable. Your soul is tempered by the challenges of earthly life. It must be strong, wise and beautiful in its demeanor and expression, coming forth in your conscious self, expressed in the beauty and wonderment of the potentials within.

My beautiful friends, ask for help when you feel you are waylaid by difficult conditions. Think of what we say and what we prescribe for you, my beloved friends. Think of God's Love for you. Think of all the goodness in your life. Think of all the light that comes and all the love that pours upon you. This will strengthen you. This will clear the air and bring you peace. A quiet prayer and a loving demeanor might be all that you can offer to another, but it is enough. It is a light, and it is a blessing, not only for you, but for them.

Be strong, my beloveds. Be clear and be willing to venture forth into the world. Often you will be given the opportunity to speak the truth in a way that others understand and relate to. You will share your light and your peace. Many will be drawn to this. You will share your joy and others will be affected by it. There is much that you can give in the world, in quiet reverence for what God has created, who you are as a soul and the beauty and the wonderment that is within you. These things must dominate and be expressed in all the intensity and beauty that you can muster, my friends.

This is God working through you, God's Will and desire that you are in alignment with love, with the truth and with God's plan. There is much to do, I know. There are many challenges to face and the world is contrary to your attitudes. Yet, you are the lights, and you can be the ones who lead those in darkness into light. You can do so as a channel of God's Love. You can do so because you have your friends in spirit beside you, your stellar friends there with you and the Love of God around you. How beautiful this is. This is your grace, your blessing, the power that you carry and the light that is you.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. I love you so. I have great compassion for your struggles. Know this, that I do not judge, but I see how difficult things can be and how many dilemmas you must face. Yet, you persist. You shall do so always, my friends. God bless you. God bless you.
