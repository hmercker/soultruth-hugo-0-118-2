# Receiving God's Love Begins as a Trickle and Can Grow Into a Torrent!

February 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025

San Salvador Estate, Trinidad

Andrew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Andrew. For those who just begin this passageway toward truth, toward God, the blessing of His Love often begins as a drop, a trickle into your soul. Your yearnings are mixed with doubt, curiosity and all things of the human condition. Therefore, the direct line and prayer to God is often mixed with these things.

But, if you persist upon this path, requiring your earnest prayer to receive this gift that God offers to you, that drop-by-drop blessing will turn into a tiny stream and, in time, will be a torrent of Living Waters that shall open your soul wide, breaking through the barriers, opening the heart and bringing ecstatic joy. It is for you to persist, my friends. You live upon an earthly world that is often resistant and carries with it barriers and obstructions.

Your minds are not used to this experience and often resist it, but your souls are eager. It is for you to open yourself, to acknowledge the eagerness of your soul, to continue in its relationship with God, its Creator, and to know the fulfilment that comes in the blessing of God's Essence pouring within, changing and transforming the soul, bringing the soul the succour, the nourishment that it needs, strengthening the soul in light and enlightenment of Love. In this way, it may come forth into your awareness in such a way that you will be freed from the burdens of the mind as well as the burdens of hurts and past conditions that are arrayed around your soul. These encrustations will be broken apart and dissolved, subject to the power of Love that God has given you. You will know great joy and freedom. You will know great wisdom and truth as you persist upon this Path of Love, this Path toward God.

It does not require adherence to doctrine. It does not require even your commitment to another. It only requires your willingness to explore and to know the gift that God has for you. It is between you and your Creator. It is a gift given freely. The only requirement is that you ask and ask with earnestness to receive it. If this is the case, you will know that blessing of God's Love, in all its uniqueness, power and beauty. It will come to you, a gift from God.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Andrew. I come to reinforce what has been told to you. I come with a whole retinue of angels who are surrounding you at this moment. We are here to pray with you and to help you open, feel and know this gift and blessing. Sit back in prayer, beloved souls, in the quietness of your own heart, reaching out to God. It is our hope that you will feel and experience this for yourself.

For this is the proof that will acknowledge the truth of this statement, which is that God is Love and that God's Love for you is real, palpable and beautiful and shall be given to you if you open yourself to its blessing. God bless you, beloved souls. May you place your feet upon the path toward at-onement with God. God bless you. I am Andrew and I love you, beloved souls. I love you.
