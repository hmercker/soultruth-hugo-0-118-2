John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, John the Beloved. I bring with me a host of Celestial Angels and spirits in the higher spiritual realms. We come because you call us, because you love us, because you follow God's Will in asking for our help to pray with you with sincerity and truth. Your longings for His Love are reaching His Soul and we come to pray with you, to love you and to raise you above this human condition so prevalent, so diaphanous upon this Earth, that it surrounds this world, covering the joy that is possible.

We lift you above. We cradle you until you are ready to fully walk on your own. Be prepared, for this next step is a glorious tribute to our Heavenly Father's plan for the souls upon this Earth. We are here with you, supporting you, upholding you and, of course, loving you, for Love is the basis of this plan, this transformation that is happening upon this Earth.

Love is the foundation. It is the purpose. It is what calls you to God and your soul answers. This is why you are here in this state of prayer, this state of communion with our Creator. It is always the Love, dear children of God. It is always the Love. Bring this deeply into your souls. Pray on it and stay close to God, especially in this next little while upon your Earth as God prepares to answer your prayers for more Love and stepping up in this next phase of development for your souls.

Love God with all your being. Love God. Love your brothers and sisters and open your souls, your hearts, your whole beings, to the influence that God is pouring upon the Earth. Remember, you have many, many souls who are available to you. Pray deeply. Ask them to come and pray with you.

I am John the Beloved. My great love is with you, touching your souls. I commend you for your efforts to be with God. God bless you and may you continue to love. Stay open.
