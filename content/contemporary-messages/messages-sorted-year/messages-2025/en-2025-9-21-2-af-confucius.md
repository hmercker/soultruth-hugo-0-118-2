# You Have Heard the Tolling Bell

September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Confucius received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Confucius. Soon you will fly away, back to your perch in the world. I urge you to take the words, guidance and experiences that you have had today and the days that have followed today into the world, into your world, so that you may be more aware and more attuned to the truth of your soul and the truth of your soul with God and His great Soul.

You are a part of a great transformation of this world. You have heard the tolling bell that has brought you forward to God and others will hear this tolling bell as well. I urge you to listen. Listen to what your heart and soul tells you. Listen to what God guides you to do and be that light for others, be that light in the world, for the world is desperate for light, desperate for love. God will guide you how you may proceed and be that channel of light and love in the world.

My beloveds, my beloved, beautiful children of God, the time grows short and the opportunities are many, but it is for you, beloveds. It is for you to walk in the world with this truth held high in your consciousness, in every expression of your life. For when you can do this, you fulfil God's desire for you. You fulfil God's plan for humanity. Do not let go of the inspiration, the insights and the revelations that have come to you, but expand upon them and apply them to your life in every way so that, in time, the clarity and power of your instrumentality will assist many to find the light, to find the Truth of God's Love.

The responsibility rests upon you, my beloved and beautiful birds. The plumage is changing within you, beautiful colours, beautiful blessings of God upon you, every feather resplendent in these blessings. Allow yourself to fly and to be in the stratosphere of love. You will bring many blessings to others as you are in that place, exultant in love and light, all the beautiful colours of God's blessings upon you. Oh, beloved birds, children of God, we beseech you to take seriously your journey, to be dedicated and true to your soul's desires. As you do so, you will find great joy and fulfilment in your service for God and for humanity.

May God bless you and keep you in this Light. May you forever be in the grace of God. May your instrumentality, your purpose, your gifts work toward the transformation of humanity from darkness into light. I am Confucius. I come to you in love and encouragement. I come to you with deep concern for humanity and a great appreciation for your efforts. I love you so, dear souls of God, unique birds every one indeed. Fly and be in that place of light. We will sing our songs of love in the truth, in the soul that is exalted in love. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I fly with you. I sing with you. I love you. God bless you.
