Goldie received by Al Fike

God bless you, my friends. I am Goldie. God wants sunny days for you each and every day. Even though the clouds may gather and the rain may fall in your heart, you may have a sunny day, a day of joy, a day that dedicates your beautiful soul to the Love of God and to express that Love in all the ways that it can be expressed. All the beautiful gifts that you possess, all the beautiful Light that is yours to give. God will give you more and more. It is endless what God can give to you. Allow Him to give you all that is possible to be given.

When you pray and open yourself to receive the gift of His Love, then there are no limits, only the limits you set for yourself, but when you acknowledge the day in prayer, in joy, in smiles, in desire for all that which is good, then you will be blessed. You will be blessed deeply and abundantly, all the goodness of God’s Love pouring upon you. No matter what is around you, no matter the challenges that exist in your life, you may experience joy. You may not experience the heaviness of this world if you decide to be with God, for in that beautiful gift and communion with our Heavenly Father, you will know the joy, you will feel the upliftment and you will smile.

This is God’s gift to you. No matter what humanity might create for itself, God has beckoned your soul to be in communion with His great Soul. In that, the creativity, the expressions of the soul, can only bring joy, can only bring Light and only be in alignment with all that God has created and His beautiful Laws of Love, realized and expressed. Be Love, my beloveds, beautiful brothers and sisters. It is important that you express joy in the world, that you are joy and that your souls sing in the praises of God, the beautiful melody that love creates. My lovely, beautiful brothers and sisters, know that you are loved, that Goldie loves you and around you are many angels that love you dearly. They crowd around you. They help to bring greater light and greater joy. This is God’s gift to your soul. Indeed, may your soul gift to your consciousness the wonderment that is of His Love, the expression that is joy, the song of the soul expressing itself in all its beautiful ways in your life.

God bless you, my friends. I am Goldie and I sing with you. I am joyful with you, and I love you. God bless you, my beautiful friends. I love you.
