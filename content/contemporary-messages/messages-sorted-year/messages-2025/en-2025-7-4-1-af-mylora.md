# Honour God's Creation and Creation Will Honour You

July 4<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

My friends, I am Mylora. I come to pray with you. I come to assist you in your efforts to bring greater light to the world, greater harmony in this world. When I walked the world, I was known as a medicine woman, though that was not my label or my name at the time. That was many, many years ago, but I learned about nature. I learned about plants. I learned about what nature had to offer to help humanity, to heal and to be strong. I had many forays out into the forest, picking herbs and feeling the influence of my spirit guides. I have always had a deep love for God’s creation, for this world of yours. I have been attuned to the healing energies, blessings of God that are available for humanity.

Each of us can be a channel, an instrument to bring greater harmony to the world. Each of us can be attuned to that which is harmonious and beautiful in the world. This is a matter of application and focus of love, for when you love the world of God’s creation, you come into greater alignment with it. In that alignment, knowledge and wisdom come. As your souls open to God and to God’s creation, so much comes to your awareness and your capacity to love, to honour your life and all life. As you seek the great Essence of God, then you are in alignment with all that God is and all that God created.

This is the highest approach, the most powerful way of bringing harmony to the world. You have prayed for this. As you continue to seek out God, finding your at-onement with your Creator, then the flow of light and healing of energies meant for the Earth, energies from the Earth meant for you, all come into play. All are available to you. Allow yourself the great blessings of God’s creation. God does not say you may have this, but you may not have that. God says you may have all, but in the receiving of God’s blessings, there is also a need to give back, to be a channel for the world, for humanity and for all of nature. Whatever your gifts may be, whatever lies within your soul, may those gifts and those possibilities come forth so that God may use them to bring greater harmony to the world. Do not restrict your capacities to be a channel. All these things come with love. As your love for God and for God’s creation continues to grow and is awakened by His gift of Love, then your capacity to be that channel of love, light and healing is strengthened and comes into greater alignment with all that is in harmony with creation.

Be humble in your efforts, my beloved friends. Have great faith, faith in God, faith in God’s Will, God’s plan and God’s ability to heal all that is out of harmony with His creation. You all have this knowledge within you. You all have many gifts and many potentials to help heal the world. As you heal yourself in Love, Love will heal the world as well. Be wise in your thoughts, your efforts and how you are in the world. For you need to act with reverence and harmony, with peace and loving acknowledgement of God and all that God is, and all that creation is.

This is the way in which your prayers will be answered, and the harmony will come to the world. Seek out your own soul. Seek out your soul’s relationship with God. Seek out your relationship with the gift that God has given you, which is life. Do so in reverence and joyful acknowledgement of the wonderment of God’s creation. You will find greater joy, greater insight and greater love for where you are, who you are and where you are going, all a gift from God, all beautiful in God’s Eyes.

God bless you. I am Mylora. I love you so, my beautiful earthly friends. God bless you.
