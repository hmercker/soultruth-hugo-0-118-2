# Each one a Story, each one a unique Soul

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am delighted to be with you all, as I spent part of the time today with my family, both here and in other places. When you share the stories of revelation of how God works in what seems mysterious ways, but in retrospect perfectly, you touch the hearts of others who seek connection, connection with God. And though they may call it the Source, Creator, universal love, they are talking about the soul’s longing to connect in that oneness that comes in response to true prayer, in the flow of grace, beyond the discernment of the mind and into the perceptions of an awakened soul.

I listen to these stories and remember my own journey.  As I awakened, I felt nothing but compassion towards all the yearning souls, all the wounded hearts, the homeless, the helpless, the hungry. And as my beloved knows, this was the work I was engaged in when we met. I had given away most of my material things, but I felt the richness of what I had received in prayer was the greatest wealth anyone could ever attain, and I found that, for the most part, those souls who longed for love were often impoverished in worldly means. So, whether one is abundant in material wealth or wondering where their next meal may come from, it is the hunger of each soul that will lead them to this awakening in the love of God.

Each one here has a story to tell. Each one is a unique story. Each one is a unique soul. And so if you consider yourself a disciple of the Master, you realize that his disciples, the original apostles and those you may or may not have heard of around the Master, who went out into the world, each with their own version of their awakening, of their souls being touched and in transformation in the love of God, that this was a necessary component of what became Christianity.

These days, so much of what was once pure is now compromised. So much of the essence of what the Master taught, diluted, or set aside by the material mind and the desire to succeed in the world. I tell you, my dear ones, you have succeeded, and so, as the wealthy might share their billions, might engage in philanthropy to help those in need, I ask you each to consider sharing your wealth, the great treasure of God’s love that you carry in your souls and that brings you joy and that brings others hope. Your journey and the telling of it can change a life, and this has an effect, as you would say, exponentially, like the ripples of waves on the ocean.

The vastness of the universe strikes awe in the mind that cannot quite grasp its size and complexity, and yet, when I would sit and pray, and just ask God to be with me, to give me guidance, to touch my soul as you do, I could feel at one with things that maybe I could not understand intellectually, but I could feel at one with my soul and the soul of God, my Creator.

May your prayers this week and beyond bring you all the healings you wish to have, and though you may not be able to identify all the reasons, your souls will know how to heal. Your souls must allow this great gift, that you may carry it to others, for who else will do this, if not you? Of course, I don’t say this in a way that might make you feel that you have no choice. But I will say that as you receive more and more of the essence of our heavenly Father, you will be compelled more and more to share, ever deeper, and this will lead to prayers with those beautiful souls who so hunger for the love of God, and to be carried above this world while still in it.

Lastly, I say there are many, many here who will assist you this week, and as you call, we come, and it is our honor and privilege to serve you and delight in your progression. Be of good cheer, sing praises to our heavenly Father, and allow us to work with you. You are so loved.

I thank you. I am your sister, in Christ, your friend, your family, and whenever you wish, your guide. God bless you.

I am Care.
