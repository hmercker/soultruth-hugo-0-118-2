George Gurdjieff received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, George Gurdjieff, Papa G.

I come to this bright and beautiful gathering of souls to serve you. How fitting the message from Noah is given in these days on earth. The core of his message is perhaps hidden, but I can tell you it is faith. Noah stepped out in faith. I was put in a situation, just before the Russian Revolution, as it was called, where I could see the darkness, the violence, the revenge that was coming, and so I prayed and stepped out on faith, and I brought many dear souls with me out of harm’s way to France.

As you may know, I was a spiritual teacher and composer, though some call me a philosopher, and I had a purpose. I had spent many years studying with different masters, different theologies, looking for the core of spiritual life, and I awakened in love, a conscious soul. So, my mission became to help others awaken from the sleep that pervades so many on earth;  from the buffers that many use to protect themselves from the slings and arrows of everyday life and the hardships they may encounter, whether rich or poor, but felt by the soul. There is no poverty worse than an impoverished soul. And so, you have chosen the path of soul awakening in the great love of our Creator. You have chosen to step forth in the struggle between unconsciousness and being awake in a world asleep. You have chosen to be of service, and of all these things, you have chosen, above all, to be transformed.

And yet, the persistence of sleep lingers. The great attractions of the world, its material treasures, its constructs, and its promises begin to be seen as they are, hollow, turning to dust. So, in my work, I often chose to confound my students by telling stories they could not possibly understand (comprehend) from an intellectual point of view. I taught them dances that required prayer and dedication. We had community, and everyone was given a task, and these things I realized I had to change at a moment’s notice to help those not fall back asleep. For, in my own life, I had dealt with these issues and to a large extent, had succeeded, therefore, enabling me to serve others.

Every prayer that comes from the soul deep within touches the soul of God, Who, as you know, responds. There is not a great amount of anything else required. No mental gymnastics, philosophies, or yoga postures can bring the love into the soul, only the deep longing. And I give you this message not because you are bereft of this knowledge, but because it will reach many outside your small group and even some of my own followers whom I still wish to serve.

I also wish to encourage you to move forward when you feel the shock of change. These shocks, however troubling they may seem, are truly gifts because they require you to walk in faith. They require you to take action and to follow your guidance in prayer, that you may step forward in service to the world and to all the souls in need.

There are many ways to serve, and there are many gifts in this circle. I urge you to use your gifts, to walk in faith. You will be very glad you did, for everything done in love serves God and the world and your soul.

May you all be blessed in the love of God. I want to thank my spiritual grandson for taking my message and for all here for the wonderful work you do. I am your brother and friend, in Christ. I am a redeemed soul in the celestial heavens.

I am George Gurdjieff. God bless you.
