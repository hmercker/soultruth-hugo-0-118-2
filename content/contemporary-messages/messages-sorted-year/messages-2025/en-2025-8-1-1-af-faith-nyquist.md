# A Call to Reclaim Balance with God’s Creation

May God bless you deeply with His Love. I am Faith. I come to speak of the animals, the creatures of God. What has happened in your world is that the places of ideal habitation for all creatures of God’s creation have been usurped by humanity. Those temperate places in the world have pushed out most of the natural order and the creatures that used to inhabit these places. Now, they are left with the extremes, the northern climates that are harsh, the deserts which are harsh. There are parts of the jungle that still exist. Yet, in general, the world that is ideal for life belongs to humanity.

It is because the numbers of peoples upon the Earth are so great and the needs are so great that all land that is arable and habitable has been usurped by the will of man. I cannot blame them, for how else can you survive, but by claiming these lands that are available to you to create and to grow things that you need? Yet, until humanity’s numbers are decreased, there is a crisis in your world. God is ensuring that all creatures survive, some of them down to the numbers you could count on one hand, but they exist. When changes come to the world, when humanity is less in numbers, these creatures will repopulate the world and claim their place in God’s creation.

You may pray all you like for the Earth and for everything to be in harmony, but it is required that humanity, in great numbers, change their habits, their needs and their environment. For without this conscious change, without a majority of humanity making the effort to change, a prayer and a meagre effort to help humanity will unfortunately not be enough. I do not suggest that you stop praying for the world. It is important that you do so, but pray for change, my beloved friends. Pray for those conditions to materialise on Earth that will bring balance and harmony. Pray that each individual upon this planet will realise that they must change. Their habits must change. Their desires must change. Their priorities must change.

How is this accomplished, my beloved friends? It is accomplished through the desire to be in light, to be in harmony and to be in peace. Rather than be distracted by material endeavours and material blessings, it is important that the spiritual is focused upon and that there be a balance in each individual between the spiritual and the material. In this way, it will be reflected in the world as well. God does not mean for humanity to suffer and be in deprivation, but God also does not mean for humanity to be in excess and great indulgences. Harmony is balance and balance comes with awareness, love and appreciation, understanding that what you may require to live is not altogether the lifestyle and way that you live now. It can be reduced, it can be simplified, and it will be compensated if the individual seeks out God in prayer, finds joy and happiness within and with their relationship with their Creator.

When these things are accomplished in the world, then there will be balance, then the creatures of the world will live alongside humanity in harmony. There is much work to do, as you well know. There is much work for every individual upon this planet. The beginning of that work starts with your conscious awareness of the conditions that you create for yourself and the conditions that you create all around you with your behaviour, your habits, your desires and your priorities, all things that contribute to the human condition and the psychic reality that is your world. Each of you contributes with your thoughts and your deeds. Each of you contributes with your wants and your desires. Be aware of what these things are and how they may affect your world and your brothers and sisters. Often, they are enacted with good intentions, but good intentions are not enough, my beloved friends. You need to act with wisdom, with love, with a desire to create harmony.

How can you do this? First and foremost, you must take these desires and this effort to God, for as you pray and receive the great Love of His Soul into yours, there will come wisdom and guidance. God will help you find the way. God will show you. Yet often that is the road less travelled in your world. It means that you will be different in your perspectives and in your life, compared to many others. Examples are needed. God needs each and every one of you to be an example, to bring harmony into yourself, into your environment, with one another, with all peoples. This is a formidable task, but what will save the world is not idle intentions that amount to very little in action, but bold and focused action and intentions which bring immediate light and relief to the world.

It is your choice, as always, whether you will be an active agent for God, whether you will seek to be guided by God and whether you will be a channel of love. Each day presents its opportunities, my friends. Each day is a beautiful gift to each of you. Pick up the reins of truth and love and what change that might bring in your attitudes and your behaviour. To be serious upon this Path Divine, to truly know God’s Love and what that does and is in your life, is to be an active agent for change.

I lay the gauntlet down before you, my friends. Will you make change? Will you seek harmony? Will you seek peace? Will you seek to nurture your world, something you have just prayed to do? It is for you to understand what that truly means and how that might truly come about. May you know the wisdom of your soul. May you understand the guidance from God. May you realise that to bring harmony to yourself through love, through Divine Love, means to change all that which is not in harmony with God’s creation and His Love. Be a light, my beloved friends, be a truth sayer, giver and speaker, an example. Then, you are truly a light.

May God bless you deeply, my beloved friends. I am Faith. I come to speak plainly to you of the truth and what it truly is. I hope you understand that the time grows short and the workers to bring love, peace, harmony and light to the world are few and far between. Make your efforts, beloveds, and God will bless you deeply for everything you do that is in harmony with God’s creation and with God’s Love. God bless you. My love is with you all. We are close. God bless you.
