# The Importance of Your Prayers for Yourselves and Spirits on this Ship

May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am George. I am so very pleased to be with you, true children of God, upon this voyage. I see growth and development in your longings for Godâ€™s Love. I see purpose in this voyage. I want to share with you the importance of your prayers during this voyage in particular.

You are healing your souls, but also the souls of your fellow people and spirits on this ship. Those humans are not aware of the healings, but they are open. They are receptive and your prayers are touching their souls. You are also lighting the way for many spirits who inhabit this ship, some of whom are moving on, some of whom are learning from how you pray, how you are illuminated, especially when you are in prayer. They do not understand yet, but they do see, from when you were not praying to when you begin to pray, that your soul's light lights up as a fire. They are curious. Please, when you pray, remember these souls who are learning and ask the Father to assist them, to bless them, to help them open their souls so they, too, may experience the Love that will help them move forward in their soul development.

There are other purposes as well. As the two sisters (Dorothy and Darlene) have mentioned, the planet, especially under the ocean, is being healed. There is much love that is being expressed among you. That love is extending to everyone upon this ship and those under this ship. You see, you have purpose in being here, a great purpose. You are assisting in the transformation of this Earth into a more loving and healing environment. This is what we guide you to do, whether you are on a cruise, on the water, on the land or even in the air. As you pray, so many people around you are impacted. Feel free, dear ones, to pray wherever you are for however long you are guided or inspired, because your work is impactful.

I give you my love. My Father blesses you deeply again and again and again. For you are His true children. You are workers in the building of this Kingdom of Love on the Earth. You are blessed. My love is with you and I thank you for listening. I am George Stokes, once a leader of a community. Now, I lead for my Father many, many souls who are new to this Divine Love. God bless you.
