I am here, Eileen Caddy, Aunty Eileen.

My dear ones, I feel your intentions. I can relate to your needs, most especially in the context of earth changes as well as political situations around the globe. So, what to do? You know that prayer is the doorway to the heart and soul of God as well as the invitation to those of us who are more than willing to assist you, to influence you, to inspire you, and to bring others into play that can assist you in manifesting your sanctuary, your places of refuge.

Many of you may know my story, camped out with my family in our caravan, I would go off each day and pray and receive guidance, and we put the word out. We didn’t say “Oh, you must be a Christian or a doctor or a farmer”. We simply put out what we needed and invited all, asking them to be respectful of spiritual guidance, whatever their beliefs, to accept the challenge as well as the blessing. So, when we needed a carpenter or a group of laborers, we simply prayed, and they arrived. Our garden was among the most magnificent, and we felt the influence of what we called ‘elementals’, or some call ‘fairies’, but now I see they were angelic helpers. People came to help with the gardens and with the construction of the universal hall. And now, of course, it’s well known, there are many, many buildings and a new hall rising out of the ashes like a phoenix, a result of bringing the community back to a prayerful state. And though their focus may not be specifically receiving the Divine Love in their souls, there are many who have this love, and so I offer you this template of being open to all those looking for spiritual community, for sustainability, and to develop the gifts that they have, whatever culture, whatever age they may be.

This blessing upon the earth is not only greatly needed but, as you have said, a possibility within a window of time. So, reach out to all. What have you got to lose? Some will accept and some will not. But those who come sincerely will help manifest the vision each of you has of what a community based on God’s love will look like. And of course, these things are kinetic. There is never stasis in the universe. All things are changing. So, allow your prayers to open you to change without fear, to walk in faith, to remember every prayer that you sent up and the answer that came. For as you know, all things are possible with God. Remember, we are here to assist you, and so we shall, and your dreams will come true, that the earth may be blessed.

We continue to watch over you, to protect you, and offer guidance. And I wish to thank my brother for taking this message and for all here and beyond who may hear it. With all my love and the blessings from all here in the celestial realm, may God bless your efforts and may you walk in the flow of His grace. I am your sister in love, in Christ, and in community.
