# Works With Bartholomew to Bring a Gentle Balance to His Sturdy Hand

January 10<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Mary received by Al Fike

I come to bring a gentleness to [our dear friendâ€™s insistence](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2025/en-2025-1-10-1-af-bartholomew-mary/). He has a gift that empowers him to be strong and forthright. I have a gift to bring love and nurturance. So, we work together, for there is always a need for balance and grace. Even when there are conditions and times that require strength and fortitude, God also brings the gentleness of His Breath upon us all, upholding and reinforcing the beauty of love, the grace of love and being truly in His blessing, His Light shining down upon us and showing us the way.

My love is with you, my beloveds. I am Mary. I love you and I will be close. God bless you, beloved souls upon the path of grace, of love, of peace. God bless you.
