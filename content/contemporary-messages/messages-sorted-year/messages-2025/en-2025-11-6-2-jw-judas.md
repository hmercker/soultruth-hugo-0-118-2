Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, Judas, your brother.

Those here in this circle have many in spirit that wish to communicate. On behalf of them all, I wish to have you know without a spot of worry that you are loved, you are watched over, and you are followed by those who are not as far along on this path but can see your light.

I would like to suggest to you that you go deep into listening, and I will give you, if I may, an example of the benefits of lending an ear to us. For, do you not imagine that when a composer is receiving music, his or her soul is not opened to listening? There are many forms of inspiration. One can be more on the material level, inspired by those they consider to be wonderful artists, those who can put words on a page that may touch the heart, inform the mind, music that will make you dance, dance that will bring you joy. Prayers that will reach your soul. If you wish to utilize your gifts in any field of endeavor, it is essential that you listen. And it is one thing, of course, to restrict yourself from endless chatter or the internal musings of your brain and your mind, but it is quite another matter to be in that place where your soul is able to hear another soul, as my brother is engaged in. It doesn’t take some kind of magic or stupendous achievement, but it does take one’s soul longings to simply be in ascendancy over all the noise of the world, all the chatter, and in this place of silence, we can speak to you. It doesn’t matter how you utilize this wisdom, for once attained, whatever endeavor you choose pertaining to the gifts that you have been given will bear fruit, whether it be a book or a play or a song or making a meal, or any of the things in life that assist others.

I have spoken through this one before many times about the need to step forward on his journey, to be confident that he is being used by God and by us, to let go of reluctance and doubt, and so I say to each one, when you can do this, when your prayer reaches a depth that touches the soul of God and God releases the great bounty of His gift, the effulgence of light and grace, you are no longer in a state of concern. Your troubles disappear, even questions, most especially those involving the intellect, are dissolved in truth, truth that becomes apparent. And this is why when you pursue these endeavors, in the love of God, all that comes through is a blessing. You cannot be assured that all will be open to it, but you can be assured that those who will recognize it. They will desire to feel it, perhaps enquire of you. What is this I feel about your person? Why am I moved by what you have presented, played, read, spoken? And as you can guess, and as you have even engaged in yourself, you can begin to tell them what your practice is, which of course is beyond doctrine and dogma, because it is simply essential. It is the connection with the great Being of the Creator, whose fountain of love never ceases, whose blessings are never-ending and ever-expanding.

We have told you that the universe is progressive, and this path of divine love is a progression of your soul. So, hand-in-hand, with us, and with our loving Creator, we co-create from our visions, from the wishes of our souls, from the longings in our hearts, the world we wish to live in. Have faith and know these things are not beyond reach. And as you truly let go and allow God to put the great love into your being, you can walk in light, you can speak in love, you can share your gifts and bring this blessing to all. So do not doubt your gifts, your abilities, your blessings. Step forward in the light, and as you give to the world, you will receive the great blessing of forevermore and the opening of your gifts, for there is no ending in the eternity of God’s love and God’s love for you.

I thank my brother for taking this message, and I hope I have inspired you. There is much light in this circle. There is much talent, not to be wasted. And so, simply remember, as we always say, when you call, we will come, and we assist you in joy, and it is our privilege, believe me. With all my love and blessings, I shall step back. I am your brother and friend in Christ.

I am Judas. God bless you.
