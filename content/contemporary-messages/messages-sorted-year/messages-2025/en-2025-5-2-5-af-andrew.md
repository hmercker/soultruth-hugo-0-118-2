# Continue to Forge Ahead

May 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Andrew received by Al Fike

My brethren, you continue to forge ahead. Your desire for progression, for greater amounts of the Father's Love in your soul, to be in harmony together and to work together for the ultimate harmony of God's Love to enter this world in abundance and to the souls of each individual on Earth. This is our goal, as you well know, to be true to the Will of God, to have the Truth of God's blessing for humanity, delivered and known in the world, to be true to your soul's desire and soul's purpose to know that at-onement with your Heavenly Father.

I am Andrew. I come to congratulate you in your efforts. I come to suggest that there is more work to do, continued collaboration to be had and beautiful lights to grow. Each one has been blessed deeply. Each individual has found their way to greater light and love. We continue on this journey together. When you feel unworthy, my brethren, know that God's Love for you is immense and that you, acknowledging this, must have great love for yourself. This comes hand in hand, loving yourself, loving God, loving one another, equal parts on the journey of soul awakening. As God infills you with Love, so there must come Love bubbling up from your soul into your consciousness and through that flowing out to others.

It is not so difficult or complicated. It is only within your mind that you put caveats on how God might love you and how you might love yourself. These are old and tired thoughts that need to be released and for you to give yourself the freedom, the joy, the depth of understanding, how beautiful you are, how loved you are and how much love you must acknowledge and keep for yourself. In this way, you give and sustain a great light within you and open the doors for more.

It is important that you continue to grow in light and love. Do not let anything inhibit this, but allow. Allowing is so important that you wish for, you desire and you accept the great Love of God within you. That great Love must permeate every part of you. Every beautiful aspect of your being, which God created in Love, must know Love and must express Love. That way you will be strong, healthy and balanced in your perspective and loving in your demeanour. The power of love is the greatest power of all. Even the natural love has a great capacity to heal. Yet, most of all, the greatest power comes with God's Love.

May you know this, breathe it and live it so that you are truly lights in the world and beautiful, beautiful channels of Love for God. I am Andrew. I congratulate you on your efforts. I urge you to continue to love one another, love yourself and love God. God bless you. My love is with you, my friends. My love is with you. God bless you.
