Orion received by Al Fike

â€¦ pour into your soul, flood your soul with Love. I am Orion. Yes, the world needs you desperately. The world needs all the time you can offer in service, for every time you gather together like this, pray singly, do something in groups, whether you are together in the flesh or not, you add a little more light to this world. You help counteract the conditions and darkness of this world. It is important that you continue to sustain your desires, your prayers and your efforts to help change the world.

Everything starts with a small thing, some action, some intention, that is acknowledged and expressed. This leads to something else that will lead to something else, building as it goes. I applaud your efforts, my dear friends. I applaud your desire to seek for light, for truth and for the great universal Love of God. For in this seeking, in your actions, in your ways and being within the world, you are creating life wherever you go. It makes a difference and it helps many.

I urge you, my friends, to continue to release all that holds you back and to allow God to inspire you, so that you may see the way forward clearly, that you may know your purpose, your role and your part in the great scheme of things, to be humble in this, joyful in this, willing and present, as God continues to guide you. We continue to come close, seeking to assist you in your awakening, to strengthen your light, to bring your beautiful soul present, resplendent in all its gifts, all its beauty and all that God intends with His creation.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. May you know that deep peace. May you be awakened in truth, perception and loving qualities that come from God through you. I wish you all the blessings. Open yourself to the inflowing. Be with God. All will become clearer and will be strong, steadfast and walk the path intended. My beautiful friends, it is an honour to be with you. Yes, if you make the time, I will speak tomorrow and answer your questions. It seems your questions continue to be repeated. I continue to repeat my answers, but this is the way of humans. It takes time to absorb the truth, integrate it and to live it. I am happy to reinforce, deliver and make myself available for further efforts to communicate truth.

My love is with you. I am Orion. Oh, how I love you, my friends. Indeed, I often find you amusing, a little quirky but lovable. Very lovable, my beautiful friends. God bless you. God bless you.
