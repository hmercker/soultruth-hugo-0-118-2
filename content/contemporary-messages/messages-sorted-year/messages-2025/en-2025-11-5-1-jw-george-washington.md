George Washington received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother, George Washington.

Although I do not visit this earth plane very often, I am delighted to be here with you all today, and I prompted my brother the other day that I would be coming. It has been many years since I really engaged in political discussions and matters of government, for my work has more to do with the work of God’s love and encouraging prayer to receive it. Although while on earth, I was devout about the brotherhood of man, humankind, I had my foibles. I believed in a strong leadership, but I was no member of any party, and I rebelled against what I believed was tyranny, the English king, as you know. At the same time, there was the dichotomy of my own tyranny, being a slave owner, and some of the measures I took as a general, which involved killing others. And though the cause was righteous and just and remains so, I encourage prayerful means, non-violent means, as in your country yesterday, when the people have spoken.

On earth, I always believed there should be no kings, myself included. When I was asked to be one, I rejected that proposal.  And I wish government to serve the will of the people and those of us involved in the constitution, that was our great desire, that the will of the people would be served, that there would be a balance of power in government, so we attempted to establish a framework for that and as you may be aware, whenever that framework is being dismantled or challenged, the people rise up. And so this has drawn me into your circle because I am a celestial and I pray for the love of God still and receive it evermore, and I know that where you are, and not only physically, but in your beliefs, are your aspirations for freedom on the earth. For those who are marginalized, for all to be considered equal, and for all to be cared for. These desires, when in harmony with the love of God, are encouraged, but first and foremost, as you do in this circle today, go to God for guidance. Go to God to receive this love, this Divine Love. Go to God for the company of the celestial angels, that His grace may fill your soul, where all things become clarified and revealed.

So, as you grow in the love of God, individually and as a community, pray for those who are the administrators of whatever government is in power, in whatever country you find yourselves in. For in the love of God is true freedom, and in true freedom are all the lesser freedoms of speech, movement, and opinions, whether they be yours or others, true or false. For the soul knows what is true. And I pointed out my foibles on earth to remind you that though one may be devout and totally accepting of God, one can be very misguided. So, love those who offend you. Show them the way with truth and with an open heart. For when in crisis, an act of kindness will always overcome the difficulty encountered. And as so many of you have come to the truth of Divine love through your own personal crisis, and your wish is that your country and the world have a similar epiphany, this will not happen in an instant.

As you grow and as you live this life in the grace of God, you have a profound effect upon the world. I would say you have voted with your souls, and you have walked forward with an open heart in the love of God. May your nation be blessed. May this earth be blessed. May humanity find oneness in God’s love with your help.

I thank you for allowing me this time, as I so wished to come and all of us here, and there are many, embrace you in the love of God and are with you on your walk and in your progression in truth and in Divine Love. May God bless you. I thank you. I am your brother in Christ.

I am George Washington.
