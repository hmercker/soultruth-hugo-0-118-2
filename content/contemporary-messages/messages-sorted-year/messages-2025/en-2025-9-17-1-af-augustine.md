# Testing the Waters and Healing our Wounds

September 17<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Augustine received by Al Fike

Bless you, my dear and beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine.

Each day brings its opportunities and its choices. You may choose to follow old patterns of behaviour, or you may choose to change those patterns. Indeed, often, the old patterns crop up unexpectedly and reflexively because you are human. Yet, you have made your dedication to follow the way of Divine Love, to follow the way of the soul and to follow the way of harmony. At times, you disregard this dedication and promise. At other times, you are very much in harmony and very much following the way of love.

Our hope is that the way of love in your expressions will be greater than the way of disharmony and your habits. Each day then brings an opportunity to walk in the way of harmony and to disregard the habits of the mind. We understand your challenges. We have been on this Earth ourselves. You know some of my story and my habits, for I was well known in my time and these things are recorded. I am the least amongst you to correct you, for my ways in the world were not that of harmony or love. Yet, from our perspective, to see some of these behaviours is not pleasant for us. Indeed, at times, it brings me back to my old ways. Not that I am susceptible to these things anymore, but the memories are still there. It humbles me. When you reach the Celestial Kingdom, it will humble you when you think back on how you were in the world.

Yet, you have elected to become channels of God's Love, harbingers of God's Truth and candidates to manifest that Truth in many different ways and avenues in the world. How will you do this, if you are still subject to these conditions that hang on to your mind and, at times, are entertained by your mind? You must be vigilant. Walk the line of love and truth and toward God. If you can do so consistently, then you are well on your way to fulfilling your goals and to serving God in the way that God has designed for you. We have deep compassion for you, beloved brothers and sisters. We know how difficult it is on this earthly plane. In many ways, it is far more difficult than when I walked on this Earth, for the atmosphere is polluted with negativity, darkness, judgement and fear, with many things of the human character. Yet we are asking you to rise above, to act beyond these things, to that which will generate light.

If you are to call yourself a progenitor of light, then how will you act to be a progenitor of light? It is not a situation, a condition of one foot in the dirt and the other in heaven. This cannot be the case. This is not the way God created His Laws, His Laws of Love. Yet, at times, you walk in both and are quite comfortable with this duality. Indeed, you find it amusing to walk in these ways, but I tell you, they come at a price. Rather than building harmony, you are tearing down harmony. When you respond in ways that you think are naughty and, like a child, you test the waters to see what you can get away with, it merely indicates that you are certainly still children and the way that you are acting reflects this.

It is time to be an adult, to be responsible for your actions, your thoughts, your deeds and to be a loving soul, which is what you pray to be. This duality weighs you down. It keeps you from that harmony. Each day you live upon this Earth will be a challenge, for the current of thought and influence is primarily that which will reinforce the human condition. Yet, you pray for protection. You pray for us to be with you. You pray for God to bless you. Are those prayers sincere? Do you really wish to be in the light? Do you really wish to be a channel of love? Do you really wish to generate harmony within you and around you?

This you must consider. As you well know, every moment is a choice to be in light or not. Every moment is a choice to be a channel of love or not. Certainly, every day you go between these two conditions. When you are, for the most part, within the light, you are happy and satisfied with your way of being and your thoughts and expressions. When you are mostly in the darkness, the human condition, there is frustration. Often, you blame God for this, that God has abandoned you, that you are alone with the darkness and its influence. Yet, you know the laws well. You understand what causes this condition. Often you awaken feeling dishevelled and disharmonious. You see this as the result of actions that came the day before, including those things that you have eaten and those things that you have thought and expressed. Of course, the choice in the morning is to reinforce those conditions or to seek to remedy them. It is your choice.

I speak in these very basic terms because it appears that you have not listened to the many, many times we have talked on these matters. Like correcting young children, the repetition of what is required is often necessary. Yes, we still love you. God still loves you. That love will never be diminished by your behaviour, but your capacity to feel that love and to live in that love is diminished when your behaviour is toward darkness and disharmony and you disregard the laws pertaining to light. It is your choice, as I have said countless times, but I am here again to remind you, to assist you in making that choice. You well know that when those choices for light are made, when you are not reactive and when you do not generate possibilities of dark reactions, you will benefit from the blessings of God and the closeness of our rapport. Indeed, you test the waters. We understand that because you are children, that testing comes. We must wait for you to grow up, to take responsibility, to change those perspectives, those thoughts toward that which is loving and in harmony.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. Open wide to the inflowing of God's Love, for this is the ultimate solution to your dilemmas. This is what will encourage you toward light and what will neutralise those tendencies toward darkness. May you be blessed, my beloved souls, in the light. Let go and let God. Be love, be true to your souls and allow your souls the strength and the ability to discipline your minds, where discipline is required. Reactivity is a lack of discipline. Being attached to what others say is a lack of discipline. Being true to love and harmony is an expression of the strength of your soul and ensuring that that strength takes precedence in your consciousness is the ultimate reward for discipline.

I have said enough. I am your teacher, Augustine. Indeed, it is a teaching moment. I am happy to be your teacher. I am happy to see in your souls that beautiful light. Let it shine for us and be truly your expression. God bless you. Augustine loves you. God bless you.
