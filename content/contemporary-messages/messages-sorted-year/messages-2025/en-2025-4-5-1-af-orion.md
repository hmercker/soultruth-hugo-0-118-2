Orion received by Al Fike

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. You often think of development in a material sense, that development brings manifestation, which is of a material form, development brings mental and spiritual expressions that you can demonstrate in the world. Yet, development starts with the inner self, the soul, the mind and the spirit coming together in harmony and in alignment. The soul, fuelled by the great gift of the Creator. The spirit, in harmony with the soul. The mind, accepting and open to the influences that come from the soul, as the soul is being blessed by God, being influenced by the angels and others.

This is what needs to be worked upon, fine-tuned, if you will, and developed. When these things are in harmony, alignment and are developed well, then the material manifestations will follow. I do not think I am telling you anything new, but I am reminding you that it is important to focus upon your soul, focus upon your spiritual well-being and harmony, and focus upon your thoughts that require to be elevated and of the highest outcomes. I know this is difficult in your material world, a place that draws you away from many of these things into a more material awareness and more material expression. Yet, with discipline, desire, motivation and effort, these things that I recommend you focus upon may be accomplished. As you continue to grow and strengthen in these things, they are not so difficult to obtain and to express.

My beloved friends, we are on a journey that requires discipline, requires focus, requires faith and requires desire. When you put yourself in the position of praying today and other days and feel this is adequate, this will accomplish those things which I am recommending, then you do yourself a great disservice. For you cannot segment your spiritual progress and then continue on in material ways and patterns of thought and behaviour that bring little to your development. The true seeker and the true participant in this process of awakening and developing is engaged in this with every breath. I am not suggesting that your mind continuously think about and be in the process of engaging in these spiritual endeavours. Yet, there is a state of being, a harmony within, that starts with the soul and is encouraged by the spirit to be in that flow, that harmony, that grace of God. In this grace of this flow, your thoughts are in harmony with this state of consciousness and being. You are in the light and whatever you do in a material sense then is in harmony with the light.

This is difficult to obtain because it is so very subtle, since in your world and each of you continue to focus upon the mind, your consciousness is centred in the mind, you have great difficulties moving that consciousness deeper, lower, into the state of soul. Indeed, every day you reinforce this centredness of consciousness and the mind is well infused and has a great deal of reinforcement of mindful things, there is an imbalance. It is not one that only you carry, but humanity carries as a whole.

This is why we come and why you receive so much in upliftment, care and ministrations, because of this great impediment, this great difficulty of integrating and living a life that is less of mind and more of soul. As we have said often, you are human. You have your struggles, but as you receive more of the great gift from God, those struggles lessen and the predominance of the soul is strengthened. In time, it will have its place in your consciousness that cannot be negated or sidelined in favour of intellectual mental processes. Your emotional state will change, become more joyful, less judgmental, less angry, less difficult and problematic.

These things come on the heel of faith, prayer and discipline of mind. We encourage you in this way, upon this road. As you strengthen, as you continue to walk this road toward greater light, the way becomes easier. The recognition and understanding of what I say become clear. Within your heart, within your mind, within your spirit, you begin to subscribe wholeheartedly to the journey of the soul. As this subscription is fulfilled in everyday life, then the manifestations for which you long, the opportunities to teach and to share that are very much in your ambitions and desires, will come to be. For you have earned the opportunity, the opening doors, the guidance and the expression as an instrument of God's Will, Light and Truth.

You will be that person, that soul, that longs to fulfil its purpose, that longs to be a light, that longs to bring your brothers and sisters into this light, this truth and this understanding. Yet, the work must be done. The efforts must be made. The dedication must be clear and focused. Until these things are well in place, and you are truly dedicated, then the idea, the dream of being that instrument that you carry within your minds and desire will not come to be.

This is not a path for those who are casual seekers. It is a path that infuses and embraces your entire life, every aspect of it. It must be, my beautiful friends. You have the foundation set. The light glows within your soul, but it is often restricted by your lack of focus and dedication to God, to service and to truth. There are times when you are indeed in alignment. You feel the upliftment, the joy and fulfilment of that condition, that beautiful state of being. This will inhabit your life experiences more often as you continue to apply yourself to the task at hand.

We are optimistic. We are dedicated to your cause and your journey and will always be so. We are patient and we are generous in our time with you, as are many who crowd around you. If you could but see the efforts being made on your behalf, I think that you would be more focused and indeed realise how important it is to embrace, to be in love with love, to be that light and to be that joyful being filled with expressions of love, light, truth and joy.

I know I continue to egg you on in this journey. I know I continue to focus upon the lack rather than the accomplishments. I do so in love. I do so because you need to open your awareness to what is needed. The time grows short. We do not have the luxury of continuing on in ways that are mediocre. You must double your efforts, triple your efforts and truly be that light that you aspire to be.

You know the way. You are well aware of the journey. It is a matter of application, dedication, prayerful intensity, mindful harmony, spiritual awakening and opening to what is needed and what is being accomplished within you. Do not shy away when insights come that are painful. Do not shy away when you are guided and yet reluctant to follow. Be strong, my beloveds. Be forthright. Be dedicated and put aside your feelings of inadequacy. Put aside that sense that you are unloved. Put aside that humanness that is no longer compatible with your soulâ€™s state of being. Embrace and welcome that part of you, that deep and beautiful part of you, that is your soul, resplendent in Love.

You will find your way, my beloveds. With all that is within you, all that is around you and all that flows to you, it is inevitable that you will find your way. For you are loved so, so very deeply, so very powerfully, that you cannot help but find your way upon the path. Oh, my beloved, beloved friends, we continue on our journey. May you come to know me well and know all the friends, the angels and the bright spirits that surround you. You could not possibly be lonely, bereft or confused when this knowledge comes to you and you accept it as being real, substantial and powerful. It is all there, waiting. It is all there, flowing towards you. Seek it out. Embrace it and be at peace, my beloved, beautiful friends.

I am Orion and I love you. I love you so. May the blessings of God be with you, ever flowing, magnifying in its strength and power to transform and heal. God's blessings are limitless. Be a part of all it is and God's Love for you. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
