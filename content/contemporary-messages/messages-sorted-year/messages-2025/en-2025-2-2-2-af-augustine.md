# Finding Our Way to God's Love

February 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

San Salvador Estate, Trinidad

Augustine received by Al Fike

What is the world? The world is a place of material effort and accomplishment, but without love, what is truly accomplished? When an individual goes about his life focused on material gain and achievement, placing love in the background, is there truly satisfaction and fulfilment? There is gratification of the flesh. There is gratification of the mind. But, what of the soul? What of the spirit? Where is the gratification for these things without love?

So, we come to you, precious souls of Earth, to tell you what must be your priority and your focus. With love, and especially the highest blessing and Love of all, the Love of God, all things are possible, and all things are blessed. You bring close to you great light and great blessings when love is at the forefront of all that you do, all that you think and all that you are.

Yet, when you put love aside, when you separate these things into categories and perspectives without adding love, then you add to the conditions of this world that are not of light. We urge you, beloved souls, to put love before all things, to put love above all things and to see that love will solve all dilemmas. Love will heal all wounds. Love will show the way to those who are lost and those who have found terrible conditions of grief, anger, frustration and hurt.

Love is the great healing. Love is the great benefactor for those who wish to progress spiritually. Love is the thing that shall show the way to those who are lost in ignorance and lost in darkness. Love will bring truth. The Divine Love will open the doorway to many blessings. We urge you, counsel you and cajole you to seek love above all other things and to seek the great Love of God as your foundation, your protector, your guide and your gatekeeper in your life.

When this is given in faith, received in gratitude, experienced with openness and willingness and sought with persistence and desire, then the world will change for you, beloved souls. The world will change beyond your recognition. What once was difficult, what once was painful, what once was confusing and unfulfilling will be transformed into joy, fulfilment, knowledge and peace. Love will do this for you and for anyone on this earthly plane.

You cannot be casual. You cannot make this one little box in the series of boxes that is your life. It must infiltrate everything. As it does so, it will change everything. What once was a priority, a deep desire for something that is of the material, becomes far less important. Instead, there will be a strong desire to know the blessings and Love of God above all else.

When that is in place, that beautiful desire and effort to be with God, then all other things, all the other desires, the wants and needs that you carry with you, will be in harmony and will be in the order of priority that is in harmony. You will not know want or need. You will know that God is carrying you along lifeâ€™s path. You will know the strength, the wisdom, the fulfilment and the joy that is contained within this beloved path of light.

I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to you as I have come to many, to tell you that the solutions to your life, the fulfilment of your life and the answers to your desires deep within all come with the Touch of God upon your soul. This is the truth and the secret that the vast majority of humanity has no idea about. Yet, here you are, beloved souls, together seeking truth and seeking to know. Thus, we give you this knowledge. These precious souls who have come give you, their knowledge. Together, with the blessing of God upon you all, this knowledge has been bestowed.

It is your choice. It is your life. Whether you act upon this knowledge given is entirely of your decision and desire. But I say to you, who are those who know the truth but turn away in apathy and skepticism. For you have been given a great gift. God will not judge you if you turn away from Him and from truth, but God will feel as if these pearls of wisdom may have been squandered at your feet. Yet, within your soul, you have absorbed these beautiful truths. You have experienced, from that place, the power of these truths.

So, I urge you to go within. If you are doubtful, if you are apathetic, if you go about your daily life as you have done before, without even an attempt to apply what has been given, then know that someday, in some situation, whether it be on this earthly plane or some other plane of spirit, you will remember our words. You will acknowledge them. You will contemplate them, and, in time, you will apply them.

God is patient. We are patient. But, indeed, why wait? Why put this aside? Rather, step forward. Test out these truths in your own life. See what might come of this, what benefits may be yours, how you may grow and expand into higher consciousness and perspectives, seeing for yourself that the Truth of Love is the highest Truth of all.

It is for you, beloved souls, to take up the torch in your life. Indeed, we will be with you if you do so. We will help you and assist you as you try to find these truths. We will encourage you and surround you with protection and light, so that the dark forces, the ignorance and the fear may not touch you. Within this Law of Attraction, there is a requirement of your action and your desire to apply these things, however feeble that application may be in the beginning.

Yet, to make that effort, to try to accomplish something different and new in your life, will bring great rewards and great support. It merely requires a small effort on your part to bring great rewards to you and great blessings those around you. I encourage you, beloved souls, to seek, to find, to knock on that door of truth and to enter therein. Even despite your wariness and your wonderings, be brave and strong. God will prove to you that truth has been given. As you apply it, truth will manifest in your life.

God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. I have come to encourage you, to uphold you, to guide you and to teach you. Indeed, you are surrounded by your angel friends, and they are here to pray with you, beloved souls, and pray we will for the inflowing, the great blessing. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
