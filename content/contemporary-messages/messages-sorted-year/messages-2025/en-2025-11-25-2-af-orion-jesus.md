# Manifestations Will Defy Mindful Expectations

November 25<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Direct Voice, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Orion & Jesus received by Al Fike

**Orion:** God bless you, my friends. It is Orion. It will most likely not be Jesus who will speak first with Direct Voice, for he has the highest light and what you call “vibration”. He would be the most difficult to bring through. We will bring through someone who will be recognized and who will cause a bit of a stir amongst you and amongst those who witness this demonstration of materialisation and realisation.

Jesus most certainly will appear at some point and that we cannot determine as of yet. Each of you are eager to have this manifestation and have, within your minds, certain precepts and ideas as to what that might be. I tell you, my friends, that it is good to be enthusiastic. It is good to desire for the highest. Indeed, your beloved brother, our beloved brother, Jesus will manifest at some point, and that will be very momentous and important. Yet, because we are dealing with the material world and all of you who are so very human, we cannot predict the outcome so exactly, so precisely.

I know in your minds and your perceptions that we have the future insight and that we have a knowledge of all things that are coming. Yet, this is not the case because of the action of free will in the universe. We have a perception of the trends and the outcomes of those trends that will bring certain certainties and what may happen. The timing, however, is not determined for the time is determined by you, not by us. We are ever at the ready to bring about manifestation, to bring about the conditions and the outpouring blessings that will bring a shift to the consciousness of those who are present and those who witness this. Your angel friends are indeed at the ready to do so, but are you, my friends? Are you ready? Are you willing and are you capable of assisting in bringing forth this manifestation of this breaking away of the barrier between the material world and the spirit world?

It is a great job, a huge undertaking to do so. You sit quietly in your comfortable homes, musing about what may be. You say a prayer for God's Love, reaching for the highest for your soul. Are you also seeking to be prepared, physically, mentally, spiritually, for this great task at hand? It will require a great deal of you, my beloved and beautiful friends. It will require a great change in your life. I know that you consider this and you want this to be the case. Yet, what you are considering and what you know of how changes may take place, what will be asked of you, is somewhat naive. The changes and the requirements that are set will not be altogether comfortable or easy to accomplish or to accept.

These conditions, thoughts, projections, and ideas, are all jumbled up into your mind and your desires. Indeed, the outcomes of what you may project, the ideas that you may have, the desires that are brewing about and within you are not necessarily what is required or what will manifest. Thus you need faith and trust in what God has in mind and what is given as a blessing through us, through your angel friends, through the bright spirits and through you. You are the choke point of this blessing. Your minds have narrowed things greatly. Your desires have put a predication upon how you may serve. Your souls are willing and are able, are filled with God's Love and are of light, but that choke point is the communication between your soul and your mind and all the restrictions that are a part of this.

You must work on freeing yourselves from that place of restriction. It is beneficial not to project, not to expect, not to lay certain ideas, principles and expectations upon this project, until your soul and mind have greater communication, are freed by these restrictions and have truly accepted your fate and the future as it is intended by the Creator. We ask much of you and yet, in a way, we discourage you from owning this project, from truly being a part of it, from that place of mental ideas and projections as to what being a part of it is. It is challenging, I know. It does not allow you to exercise the parameters of your projected ideas and your desires and needs. Rather, it is a pure faith, my friends. When faith is strong, when faith is pure, then all that is of God and all that is of God's plan will be able to manifest through you.

I urge you to consider this. Consider how much you are restricting the Will of God, how your expectations and ideas are inhibiting that which God intends for you and for all of you together. I challenge you with these statements, with this review of your condition. I ask you to consider these things with an open heart, an open mind and, most certainly, with an open soul, so that you may truly burst forth in the freedom and wonderment of all the gifts and all the plans and all that is of you and God in relationship together.

You come closer day by day. You are truly loved by God and your love for God builds as you grow in His Love. You know that we love you. Many spirits love you. Angels love you. There is no shortage of love, my friends, but there is a shortage of acceptance and willingness to truly be a part of this flow and this plan. They will be remarkable, unusual and wonderful, yet we continue to trudge upon the path, step by step. You continue to grow in light. You continue to accept your faith. You continue to have faith in God's plan and desire for you and so these things that are well in place will ensure success.

It is that stubborn place within you, that mindful place that continues to hold you back. Indeed, you are all at different points in this situation and this condition, but you will find your way. Support one another and love one another. Pray fervently, my friends, to receive the great gift of God's Love. Do not allow the inhibitions to dominate, but allow the joy and freedom of the soul to truly take its rightful place within your consciousness. In this way, you will find what you are seeking. It will manifest in ways that you will accept and joyfully so.

Know that we love you dearly, my beloved friends. I am Orion and we continue on our journey toward the fulfilment of our goals, toward the awakening of our souls, toward forging a stronger bond and relationship with our Creator. May His Love continue to flow in in abundance, breaking down the barriers, opening up the restrictions and bringing unanimity of soul and mind into its fullness and beauty and wonderment of expression.

God bless you, my beloved friends. Orion loves you. God bless you.

**Jesus:** I Come, your brother, your friend. I am Jesus. I desire greatly to manifest in the world, to assure the world that I exist still and that my teachings, the truth that I carry, may be given to the world in such a way that they will listen and adhere to the simple truth of God's Love.

I assure you that this will happen in time and will happen in accordance with God's plan. I wish to uplift you, to bless you, to assure you that you are loved, that we continue on this road together in service.

Blessings of God's Love be with you, my beloveds. I walk with you. I shall never abandon you or be away from you. You are forever in my consciousness, the consciousness of Love that I carry. You are my brethren. God bless you, my loved ones. I am Jesus and I love you.
