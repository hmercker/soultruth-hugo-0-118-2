# True Redemption of the Soul

April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Barbados Starpoint Circle of Light, Christ Church, Barbados

Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

It is Keea Atta Kem. Good morning to you. You speak about the great resurrection, the misunderstanding of the truth of resurrection, and how you wish souls would be more open to understanding what it means for a soul to be resurrected in the New Birth, the truth of our Master's teachings. For it is through the blessing of Divine Love in the soul that the resurrection, the rising into the New Birth, the transformation is created.

There is a great responsibility when an individual carries truth. What is it that you do with this truth? First and foremost, are you living this truth? Are you a living example of truth? For there is no higher way to bring others into the realms of truth than by being an example of these teachings. I say this because, as you consider that question, you see within yourself the challenge of truly living the teachings fully in all moments of your day, given that your human condition is strong and powerful, with well-lived patterns and deeply ingrained societal norms. In this way, your own challenges distract you from living these teachings of truth to a greater degree.

You can imagine someone who is not familiar with what you know and has their own belief system, how they have been taught and what they understand. It is rampant throughout the world. You see this, for your community is small. Yet, that does not mean that your impact is small. For as each individual grows within their soul with the Divine Love and this Light and this Love take a course of action of great change, then God can use your light and your love, the instrumentality of your soul, to bring blessings through, to open other souls, planting a seed of curiosity and wonderment.

As the workings happen through your soul to the other soul, there is a communing of sorts. It may not be evident when you speak mind to mind through your language. For not all people are gifted with the ability to easily share how it is that Godâ€™s Love transforms the soul in ways that do not cause others to be protective of what they know, what they have grown up with, what they believe, what they practice and how they perceive the meaning of their own life and their spiritual journey.

It is not always easy to spread the Truth that God is Love, that this Love is always waiting to flow into all souls who sincerely ask. Because this teaching is so simple, people often turn a blind eye to what you are trying to say. Yet, with your gentleness, your steadiness and your grace, if this soul is truly desirous of coming to know God in the way that you have come to know God and begin to pray for this Substance to come into them, in time, there will be a niggling from within them to desire to know more.

Keep living this truth and demonstrating it. Be attentive to those ways throughout your day when you are in alignment and harmony with these teachings. For just as you learn through others' examples, others also learn through your example. All souls know that love is the answer, but the ways in which love is demonstrated are unique to each one. Live your language of love and be true to yourself, for this is the way you will be able to sow the seeds for germination to take place. There are beginnings of a resurrection within others' own souls. This will take place. Attend to your own resurrection, for God then can use you as His instrument. You will draw the angels close to you. We will prompt you, guide you, and be near you, which will help to elevate your spiritual condition, making it easier to be a true example in all areas of your life of these teachings.

May you be blessed deeply and mightily as you sit in your circle, opening your soul to receiving this inflowing that is resurrecting your soul. I am Keea Atta Kem. Thank you for hearing my words, and God bless you on this day.
