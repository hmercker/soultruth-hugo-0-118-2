# Welcomes Us to Harrow

September 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Harrow Retreat, Harrow, UK

Michael Collier received by Al Fike

Welcome, my friends. I am Michael Collier. Indeed, you are where I once lived while I was on the Earth. We are very busy preparing this place and the places where you will be praying and gathering with others, very busy indeed. I urge you to be in good condition, as you would call it, to treat yourself well, to put as a priority your relationship with your Creator, your relationship with your soul and to seek out His Love wherever you can and whatever opportunities are available to you.

Think of yourself as a light in the world, glowing bright, a channel of love for God, and you will feel us close in your travels and your encounters. We are working diligently and making full use of the opportunities available to us to help many souls, both in spirit and mortals. Think of this, my beautiful friends, as you encounter each moment of each day. You have asked to be used as God's instruments. You have asked to be a part of this great opportunity to serve and so it is for you to be open, receptive, faithful and filled with love.

My beautiful friends, we will accomplish much together and there will be much in store for each one. Utilise your gifts and your abilities to help connect, to help further the Lattice of Light, to help many dark souls find liberation, to help bring truth to this part of the world, to help your beautiful friends who reside here, to uphold them and to bless them. There is much work for each of you. Much to do, many souls to encounter. It is a great blessing given to each of you and God's Hand is upon you. His Love continues to pour toward you and light, light all around.

I am Michael Collier and I welcome you to this place. God bless you, beloved souls. We are very pleased that the gathering continues to build, the opportunities multiplied. Our love is with you. God bless you.
