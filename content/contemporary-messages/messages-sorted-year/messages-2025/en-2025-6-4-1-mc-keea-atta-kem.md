# Man's Trials and Tribulations Have No Cause in God

Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

It is Keea atta Kem. I join you to bring support, to bring love, to bring healing and awareness. What I wish to bring most importantly is the awareness that man understands that the trials and tribulations they go through have no cause by God. Your trials and tribulations are strictly caused by man living out of harmony with God's Laws and living outside of the laws. When man realises their weakness or their inability to rectify their ways of being on their own and they turn to God, seeking solution, seeking repair and seeking peace, this is when, with God, they can be victor over their trials and their tribulations. When man becomes awakened to the possibility of healing and transformation of their ways of being within the mind and within the soul and they open to the greatest gift that God has given to man, the Divine Love, they then set their course, the course of their journey, on a new trajectory.

Should man choose this path of becoming victor over the lack of harmony that exists within them, they attain the peace that passes all understanding. They attain wisdom and truth. As this Love comes into the soul, making its mark, causing change, though slow, this change is everlasting. When the soul is imbued with Divine Love, that Love that has come in can never be removed, can never be replaced and will remain for all eternity. This Love that comes into the soul will desire to receive more. One who chooses prayer and by means of the longings of their soul, this prayer, when sincerely offered, will attract, through the Law of Attraction, the Holy Spirit, God's Messenger and agent for delivering into the soul this gift of Love. This action, this prayer, this desire is to be repeated over and over and over, for this is how the soul develops, is transformed and awakened to high truths, Divine Truths, eternal truths, truths that come into the soul and are unique to a soul who is imbued with the Divine Essence.

You may consider prayer, those prayers that flow through the longings of your soul, to be the remedy to all things that are imperfect in your experience. You may consider prayer as the catalyst for transformation. You may consider prayer as the foundation of Truth, Divine Truth. You may consider prayer as that channel that connects your soul to God's Soul and the way you commune and personalise your relationship with God. For as every soul is unique, so too is the relationship they cultivate with their God, a personal way for their experience, a personal way for their life, a personal way for their personality to grow, to be developed and expressed, the personality of the soul. When the personality of the material mind is open, curious and investigative over and into the mind of the soul, the merging of these qualities draws about a journey of inner awareness, a deepening and understanding of who they are and awakening of the essence of their soul.

In all of this, how this comes about, is prayer, the longings held within the soul set free, free to shout out to God, its love, its desire to receive the heavenly Touch from the Divine, the inflowing of the Substance of God, deepening the personal relationship and how they walk hand in hand with God. It is not enough to hear the experience of others. While this may be inspirational, it is not soulfully satisfactory. Hearing the experience of others does not satiate the desire of the soul. Though it can ignite this desire, it is 100% dependent upon the willingness to open, to surrender, to receive and to experience this Substance for yourself. In this way, the embodiment of the Divinity of God's Love and the realisation of this Love lived through a life is what brings deep satisfaction and fulfilment within. This is the remedy to all dis-ease, to all worry, to all fear, to joy, to peace and to compassion. It is the Divine Love that transforms the soul and awakens truth and wisdom as a lived experience and brightens the soul, the light of the soul, causing miracles to unfold in one's life. The Divine Love, when sincerely sought, will awaken you and eternity shall be yours.

When you pray, when you come before God, be intentional in the way you ask. Know what you are asking for. Know why you are asking for this. If there is any lackadaisical approach to your intention, then you must understand that this is an inhibitor for the Love reaching in all its power into your soul. Humility is necessary, to know that you need God and to learn to rely upon God is a necessary quality to deepen the inflowing. For when you come into prayer, drawing upon the true quality of humility from within you, releasing the armour that says you can do this on your own. This will allow you to tap into that childlike necessity that turns its eyes toward its Heavenly Parent and says, *“I need you. I long for you to awaken me within my soul and for that part of you that I carry in my soul to change me to be more like you.”*

This, my friends, is the realisation of God, the Substance of God living in you and through you. Pray with intention. Pray with meaning. Pray with diligence. You will then experience a life led by the soul, a soul awakened by Divine Love, a soul that lives in harmony and whose expression here on Earth through the physical body is a powerful demonstration of who and what God is.

I am Keea atta Kem. May your prayers be deep, be sincere, filled with longings, that you allow your soul to flow out to God, needing no protection, needing no shelter, in pure vulnerability and surrender. God bless you.
