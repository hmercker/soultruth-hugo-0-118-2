My dear ones, it is I, Care, your sister in Christ and your friend. May the love of God be upon us.

You have been given much information on progression in the spirit world and what happens to different souls as they cross over from the earth life, some with many regrets. In fact, it is unusual for anyone who comes over, even those who enter the third sphere, as I did, to not have some kind of regret. Perhaps this regret is for something not accomplished or for choices one made that were less than harmonious, and the feeling that accompanies this sense is one of guilt. One condemns oneself, and as you have been informed, those in the lower spheres often cannot find a way to forgive themselves. So many here have taken on the wonderful but challenging task of administering truth to these souls and lifting them up, letting them know they are forgiven, and opening their eyes the best we can to their circumstance, and to the Law of Progression.

Those who choose the path of Divine Love and wish to be transformed into divine angels, they too sometimes make choices that are less than harmonious.  And sometimes others will attempt to make you feel guilty about something you failed to do or a choice you made. But know this, when you choose God and receive the love of God, these errors become small things and eventually dissolve in love. And you know, as you progress and you spend more and more time connecting with God, praying for guidance, and feeling the love, you just let go of things that no longer serve your walk into the future. This can sometimes offend those who do not walk on this path, whose relationship with you may have been one that is less than light, perhaps one of complaint, aggression, negativity, at least at times, and now your soul does not wish to be in those places. And so, your soul invites all those to join you in truth on this glorious path; some will come and some will not. This does not mean you will no longer help others to be lifted up, but rather you will even be more helpful to those who need to be lifted up. For the love in your souls brings a healing balm to all those you interact with and all who wish to be healed. For love and light are the great healers, and they are accompanied by forgiveness and tolerance, and great empathy for all souls. So, let go of those feelings of guilt you may have, for they are not worthy of your walk with God, in love and light.

You have chosen the highest, and you may speak truth without regret, but most importantly, as you pray to be at one with God, your soul is lighted. And though it may not be perceived by those in blindness, it can be felt, and who would not wish to feel loved? Are we not all here to feel the great love of God, to share our gifts, to embrace each other in this great love, and to walk forward together as one and yet each one unique and blessed and gifted?

Be of good cheer, my dear ones, for God loves you, and as my beloved sings, as only heaven knows. But now you know. I am your sister in Christ and your friend and guide on your path. When you call, I shall come, and I love you. May God bless you.

I am Care.
