# Lesson on Discernment

August 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Happy Mediums Development Retreat, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, my beloved students. I wish to make a brief comment about discernment before our beloved Keea speaks.

True discernment comes from the soul. As your soul is developed in Divine Love, the faculty of discernment is within each one of you and every soul has the capacity for discernment. That discernment comes with a sense of knowing rather than deducing with mental capacities, something the discerning soul knows. It is a deep, resonant, unmovable knowledge, awareness of a particular thing. That soul knows when an angel is close. That soul knows when it is in harmony. That soul may indicate to the individual who is acting in a way that is bringing contrary forces to it to not indulge in these activities.

The discernment of the soul is what you must rely upon in all that you do spiritually. You must be attuned to it, beloved and beautiful students. It is there. It exists. It is for you to discover it, to know it and feel it within you. When that knowing, that conscious connection to the faculty of discernment, is made in your life, then many missteps and conditions that you may be vulnerable to that are not in harmony with love may be recognised before they even happen. The discernment of the soul is a powerful gift that God has given every soul, and it is being ignited by the Divine Love.

May you be blessed, dear and beloved students, with deep discernment. For discernment grows, expands and encompasses your consciousness with a power and ability that will be an anchor in your life and a guiding force in your life. Ask for this gift, beloved students. Pray for it to be with you and come to know what it is and how it continues to develop within you. Thank you for listening to me, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am happy with your discussions, your efforts, your desires, your harmony and your light. All is beautiful, all is effective in what we are attempting to accomplish with you. God bless you and keep you in Light. My love is with you.
