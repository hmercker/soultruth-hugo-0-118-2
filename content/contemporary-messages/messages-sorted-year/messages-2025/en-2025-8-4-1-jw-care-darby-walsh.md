Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear ones. I come in the grace of God. I am Care.

I wish to speak about something that so many cling to that causes so much suffering, not only in your earth life but also here in spirit, and that is regret. There are those who live in a state of regret, perhaps for some nefarious or inharmonious deed or even accident that they may have been a part of, unable to forgive themselves, unable to open to the forgiveness of God. Sometimes this results in a life of trying to comfort oneself. It may be trying to numb the pain through drugs or alcohol. It may be comfort food, which I, myself, indulged in on earth. And of course, carried to the extreme, this creates very unhealthy results. It may be being obsessed with money or sex, or material gain. It may be clinging to unhealthy relationships. And when one is in this state, unable to engage with others in an open and loving manner, they tend to withdraw into the familiarity of whatever their comfort zone is. And this act of withdrawing exacerbates the ability to engage, the lack of. Resulting in relationships that are not fulfilling, perhaps poor health, disappointment, and discouragement.

I would like you to know this, though. There are no souls in the spirit world that have not come over with some regret of what they wish they had done, even those whose souls were activated in the love of God, even they, myself included, had a degree of regret. Although to a lesser degree than so many souls. In fact, I’d say the vast majority who come over. Stepping out of that state requires a bit of courage, sometimes precipitated by the failure of all the methods of comfort one has tried, finally coming to a state of prayer, a state of crisis, a state of calling out. And as Augustine was very much suggesting and encouraging in what was read earlier, it does require one to be in touch with that deep longing, that intense feeling, that desire to engage with the soul of God, and this act of true prayer brings results, as you have experienced.

And, so, all of a sudden, when one is present in the love of God, there is a feeling of well-being, the harmony of being embraced by this great love. And as you grow in this condition on this journey, your heart wishes that all receive this gift, and so, you find yourself with great opportunities existing in a world of regret. It may be a simple gesture, a simple kindness, perhaps taking time to listen to someone’s troubles, their situation, offering hope, offering a prayer, and letting them know that the love of God is the love of forgiveness, of acceptance, of eternity that can bring a soul from the depths of darkness to the heavens of light.

So, let go of these regrets if you have them and, in Divine Love, help others that we may all feel this oneness, this at-onement in God’s love. There is nothing greater.

I thank you and with all here bring the blessings of God’s love with you in this prayer, together, as we are one. May God bless us all.

I love you. I am your sister in Christ, a redeemed soul.

I am Care.
