Jesus received by Al Fike

Yes, the gift of life is precious, beloveds. Each and every moment has the fullness and the richness of great opportunities and expressions of soul awakening that may come to you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to affirm to each one of you how much you are loved, how great are the potentials of your soul and how wondrous is God's creation. As our dear son has prayed, so it is so that life is filled. It is rife with great and wondrous things, blessings, openings and awakenings. As you receive the great gift of the Father's Love, so these openings are made manifest and you are cognisant of all that God has to give to you.

The awakenings come, drop by drop, step by step, prayer by prayer. Yet, they come and they shall continue to come for all eternity, my beloveds. Awakening does not just happen when the soul is redeemed by the Father's Love. Awakening continues for eternity. The expansion of awareness, knowledge, truth and especially love, will be yours for eternity. Each small step that you take today informs greater steps for the future, for God is establishing a powerful foundation within you, within your soul. That foundation will lead to greater awareness and awakenings. With love as your guide, your teacher and that which makes you whole, you will journey upon a path like none other. You will find yourself in the joy and wonderment of a soul awakening, an awakening that is eternal.

In time, you will enter into the Celestial Kingdom. You will join us, another brother, another sister, embraced in Love, a part of this great family of Love. In this entering through the threshold, the joy that you will feel will be beyond your imagining. The awakenings that you will have will make what you experience on this earthly plane paltry and a lack of great understanding. Yet, as you grow in the Father's Love, that understanding grows and the immensity of God and the immensity of God's creation will become your awareness and understanding. As you are a part of this great family of Love, you will share, as we will share, the reverie, the love and joy we have for God. This will sustain us for eternity, my beloveds, for it grows and it expands. It is truly becoming a part of you now, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. The drops of God's Love trickle into your soul. Everywhere that it touches heralds a new beginning in your life and a greater sense and expression of life. It is the elixir of the soul, what your soul longs for and what your soul is joyful for.

Focus upon this, my beloveds. Despite all the distractions of your material world, focus upon this journey. You will find that those challenges and situations of a material life will either fall away or find harmony in their solutions. When you put God's Love first and foremost in your life, then all else must fall into harmony and grace. You will see this for yourself. As you continue on this journey, you will see how God heals and brings into harmony all things. As your soul is healed and brought into alignment with God, so you become the ones who are channels of love and that harmony in your life. As you are true to God, so God responds in kind and brings to you all the blessings, all the light, all the healing and all the Love that you can receive and are able to open in its blessings.

My beloveds, we pray together for this gift. Indeed, we uplift you in light. We are together. We make a formidable force for light, love and truth in your world and in the world of spirit. We are together as God's instruments and channels of love. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Jesus and I love you. I love you so much. I am with you close. I am truly your brother and shall always be your friend. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
