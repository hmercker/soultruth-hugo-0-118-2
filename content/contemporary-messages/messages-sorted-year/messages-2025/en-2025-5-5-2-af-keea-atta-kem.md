Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Keea Atta Kem. You have talked about the importance of coming together in the flesh. It affords us the opportunities to mix chemicals together. Attributes that each carries as a gift to the world can be shared in a group such as this. The Divine Love acts in many ways. It is like a solvent that blurs and mixes each one together in loving harmony. In the gift of God's Love, there is abundance. There is unity and sharing. You come together with this desire and with your prayers. Those prayers are also unified and combined, reaching out to God. In this way, you are a more powerful group seeking out God's blessings.

My beloveds, there is so much that you can do for one another. There is so much you can do for the world when you seek to pray in unity and in truth for the highest Truth, the highest blessing. Many things are given. Many things are accomplished as your angel friends surround you and assist you in your development of soul, for it is the awakening and transformation of your soul that we truly wish for each one. Your souls ache and long for their liberations and connections with the divine and with one another in Love. This fulfilment of soul and its desires creates greater harmony within you. It also creates a greater hunger within you for more, a desire to reach higher, to expand in the Father's Love, to be true to your true self and to be in harmony within the divine orchestration that God intended for humanity.

You are developing, changing and transforming into what God intended and into what is meant for each one of you. Even though you are unique, there are many aspects of your soul that are similar that God has placed within each human being. In that placement, in the blessing of each soul, you are and can be unified in this commonality of soul composition. Yet, the expression of each soul is unique and precious. The expression of gifts, the expression of love, is filtered through the many layers of your being and so the permutations of that expression are varied. It is like the colours of a rainbow that are mixed within you in a way that is unique. Those colours exist because God created them. Those colours are within each one of you. Yet, how they manifest is the result of God's unique creation which is you.

Beloved souls, how beautiful you are as you emanate your lights, as you express your love, as you express your gifts. You are unique and yet you are one with God in His blessings of Love. May the Holy Spirit touch each one of you greatly, abundantly and deeply. Send forth your prayers, beloveds, and be with your Creator who loves you so. God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you so. God bless you.
