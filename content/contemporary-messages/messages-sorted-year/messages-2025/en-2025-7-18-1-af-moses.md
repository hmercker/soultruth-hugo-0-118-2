Moses received by Al Fike

May the blessings of our beloved God be upon you. I am Moses. I come to remind you of your duties and obligations, since you are the proprietors of the Truth. You carry the banner of Truth, which is the gift of Divine Love given to humanity, a gift that is not known, a gift that is not understood, but a gift nonetheless that our beloved brother Jesus brought to the Earth.

We are all proprietors of that gift. We all carry our responsibilities to bring that gift to humanity so that they may know it, understand the power and the great wonderment that is the gift that God has given to humanity. Be strong in this Light and this Truth, beloved souls. Do not obscure it with words and ideas that are not necessary, nor are they helpful in terms of teaching and demonstrating this Truth. The Truth is simple enough and it needs to be declared in ways, words and demonstrations that any individual may understand. Be forthright in your own actions, in your own life, that you demonstrate to yourself each and every day what it is to carry this Truth, what it is to be an instrument for God, the Creator of all, to be that instrument and that channel of love in the world.

I do not wish for you to be burdened by this responsibility, rather that as you are reminded of it, you may utilise the power of this gift for your own benefit and the benefit of all those around you. Do not be a laggard and fool yourself that you are actually doing God's work when in fact you are merely entertaining a mindful intention and construct of what that work is. For when you are working for God, when you are God's instrument, there is no confusion or doubting of the intent and the power of it. It comes in the grace, beauty, joy, Light and Truth of God's Touch upon you. It comes because God intends to utilise you as His instrument of Truth and blessings of Love for another.  It does not necessarily come in words. It certainly does not include high and mighty proclamations and complicated ideas and edicts as to what the truth is. No, it comes with the Breath of God, gentle yet purposeful. It comes with the words, simple yet inspiring, words that are directed toward the soul, words that uplift and words that heal. For the words are merely the reflection of the blessings and gifts that God is giving through you as His instrument.

Be clear about this, beloved souls. Do not add mindfully to the complications of the human condition and intention to define and to make so very intricate the details of the truth. For the details of the truth are known to the soul. The understanding of the truth is the understanding of the soul. The soul, more often than not, is obstructed by the mind. Thus, I urge you to put aside mindful things and come to God in yearning and feeling, in desire and in love. These things are of the soul. These things are what bring the soul to God. When they are expressed in clarity, in humility and in beauty, then there is no obstruction between your soul's prayers to God and God receiving those prayers.

Be clear, strong and forthright. Be humble. Indeed, add your feelings, your emotions, even if they are of helplessness, even if they are of grief or sadness. They are still true expressions of soul. In this way, God may respond to those feelings. God will help you to resolve them and to heal them. God has many blessings for each one of you. God intends for each one to be free of all conditions that hold the soul from God. God intends for your consciousness to include, to love and to listen to all that which is of God. God's Love for you is greater than anything you can imagine or comprehend. 
Yet, as you journey upon this road of soul awakening, you will glean the understanding. You will come to know how truly loved you are. In this, God will bring joy to your heart, truth to your soul and to your mind. All will be in harmony and alignment with that which is true and that which is of light. Even your mind, your material mind, will find its place and shall, in time, acquiesce to the power and domination of the soul, which has within it more gifts, potentials and abilities than the material mind could ever have or express. When one is in harmony with one's creation, the material mind is acquiescent to the power and glory of the soul and all its beauty and expressions.

Be true to that true self that is you. You will find yourself walking on a glorious road toward at-onement with God. Service to God will come as a flow, easily expressed. Understanding God will be the sounding bell of your consciousness. You will know with the surety and clarity that indeed is like a bell tolling its truth within and all around. Be humble in the grace of God. Be truthful in your pursuits and your endeavours. Have integrity, my dear brothers and sisters. Reach for the highest, greatest goal, which is at one with God through His Love.

I am Moses and I love you. I come once again to remind you of what is important and what is required for this great journey of the soul. Be in the grace of God, my beautiful brothers and sisters. We shall walk together toward that great Light. God bless you all in His Love. God bless you in peace.
