Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

I am Keea Atta Kem. I join you as your souls are open to the mighty inflowing of the Living Waters, God's Love, as you all are undergoing a great transformation within your souls. You draw us near, and we come with our love, support, and generosity, our willingness to serve our brothers and sisters, to serve the light, to serve harmony, and to serve in the transformation of your planet.

My dear friends, as your souls grow in this Love and the workings of this Love create great change within you. Healing of your emotions, healing your desires and bringing love and harmony into all things that are outside of this beautiful law. One way that you can be sure that this Love is working upon you is how you begin to perceive environments and individuals that are around you. Not only that, you begin to perceive humanity in a new way. There becomes a stirring within you and a knowing that there are no strangers.

You begin to see from within you, with the eyes of your soul, that every soul that comes around you, and every soul that is on Earth and in spirit, is not a stranger. Rather, it is your family. It is your brother. It is your sister. Your perceptions begin to broaden and these deeper concepts rest within you, knowing that each one has been created from the same source. Each one, through a long lineage and generational process, has come to be through the first parents.

While your own personal lineage is closer to your cultural norms, your patterns and your DNA, these are not parts of who you truly are. These are parts of your individuality. For who you truly are, from within your soul, is family. We are all family. When you notice your perceptions change and your view begins to soften into one of compassion and love, deep care for all whom you know, who you pass by and even in the spirit world, as this perception grows within you, you understand that at the core of their being, you are the same. You desire to be loved and to be understood. You desire to be helpful. You desire to be connected. This is a powerful change that will happen within you. This is one of the marks that you can perceive from within you as you truly begin to live from the essence of your soul.

Allow this Love that is bestowed within your soul to shower its Love, to freely emanate from you and to know that as your love emanates from you, God is working through you. This Substance of God is working, blessing and loving. Not only will this change be outwardly toward others, a mark of change will also be evident in how you look at yourself, how you speak to yourself, how you think about yourself and how you treat yourself. When the Divine Love has developed within you, it cannot act outside of love. It does not seek love because it is Love. You are learning to experience the transformation and to grow harmoniously with this Love. You are learning from your conscious choices to be more in alignment with the essence of your soul. You are seeking, more sincerely and earnestly, to allow God's Essence that you carry within you to flow from you.

At times, you put the brakes on because you are still feeling the need to protect. There is still uncertainty within you due to emotional patterns that have not been resolved. But be sure that as God's Love grows within you and your healing is underway, in time, you will have eyes to perceive all souls as family, no matter the country they come from or the culture they have grown up in. These are material forms and these are the experiences of becoming an incarnate soul on Earth. But remember, in time, there are no barriers. There is only love. Love is what you are created from and love is what you all shall return to.

Bless yourselves daily, often and deeply, with the Essence of God's Love. For as you do, this Love sees no stranger. It sees truth, it sees love, it sees the light and the blessing that all souls are in the eyes of the Father. The Source of all, who has created each and every one, whose love flows to, whose care shines upon in accordance with their desires, and responds with open arms. Consider this as you grow, change, and develop in your soul: how do you see the other? Do you see them as family? Do you see strangers? Do you see brothers and sisters? Do you see love?

May you walk in the grace of God's Light and God's Love, awakening in truth and living in truth. I am Keea Atta Kem. God bless you mightily as you open your souls to receive the Living Waters, the transformative waters. Drink deeply, dear ones. Open your souls and drink mightily these Living Waters into your souls. God bless you.
