Yogananda received by Al Fike

It is wonderful to see you all engaged in the sweetness of life. It is Yogananda. Yes, I have come. I know you well, dear daughter. I know you well. I am sure you are curious as to why these dear souls know *me* well. How is it that, though they have not studied my teachings, at least the teachings that I gave on Earth, and yet we are in close rapport together?

What I offered in the way of truth on the Earth, when I walked the Earth, I would say is *“stage one”* of truth. In that truth, I offered understandings of the body, the spirit and the metaphysical interactions between the two. Since coming into the spirit world, I now understand what it is to nourish the soul. I understand that Love is the way in which souls are awakened. The faculties, perceptions of the soul are very different from the mind and the spirit. My dear friend, if you are interested, we will give you many teachings of how to open that door and how to understand the wonderment that is soul.

For those of you who walk the Earth, the soul is neglected and misunderstood. Many who seek the spiritual path seek something that is more of what I taught while on Earth. Yet progression, understanding truth, continues on. When I entered into spirit, as was my desire, I learned more of truth, a deeper truth and a higher truth. In this, I had many experiences and journeys. In the spirit world, I encountered many, including the exalted and beautiful soul of Jesus. I was always drawn to Jesus. I liked his teachings of love, for my teachings as well were very much about love. Yet, the teachings Jesus gave were of a higher Love, a more expansive Love, a Love that is purely of God. I began to pursue this teaching. Indeed, Angels of Heaven were by my side, helping me upon that journey. I discovered much about myself. I had had many experiences on my journey of truth while I lived on the Earth and yet none compared to understanding and experiencing the awakening of my soul in God’s Love.

This is the journey I partake of now. It is a journey that is extraordinary, magnificent and all-encompassing, so much so that I do not aspire to explain those things that I did on Earth, those teachings that I thought were what was required and needed for my development and awakening, as I did to help others explore the same. Now, it is all soul. Now, it is all that is of the soul. Indeed, some of these metaphysical experiences and aspects of the spirit are valid and may lead to deeper soul understanding, but often those who follow my teachings stop with meditation and awareness of the spirit body, the physical body and the communications of the energies of the body, the chakras. These are beautiful teachings. I do not regret teaching these truths, but now I progress further, where there is a law in the universe and that is eternal progression.

I am pleased that you, dear, dear soul, who is a seeker, true and intent, that you come to learn more, to share more and to connect with others who are sincere upon the path of awakening. My dear friend, shall we awaken together, that deeper awakening that is part of the longing that is close to your heart and close to your desires to find true peace and true awareness? These things will come to you as you learn this simple prayer to receive from the Creator of all the great Love that is the embodiment of our Creator. For God gives to you a gift, something wondrous and beautiful, the very Essence of God’s Soul given to you, if you but ask to receive it, to open to it and to honour it. When this gift is received, you will begin on a journey that shall lead to at-onement with God. The journey which I taught leads to at-onement with self. The journey which I recommend and offer at this stage, which I will call *“phase two”*, is a journey of at-onement with God.

You know yourself, dear friend. You know who you are. You are clear in your desires and your intentions. The work you have done in the past serves you well. The work now begins to serve a higher self and the higher purpose in life. You are intent on this. You are well motivated. Your desires are strong and so the Laws of Attraction, the blessings from God, are given and the desires of the soul fulfilled when they are clearly expressed.

Be true to that true self, that core of your being that will lead you to enlightenment beyond your imaginings. There is still so much to learn, so much to experience and so much to be a part of. Further awakening begins, dear child, and you are in good hands. You are surrounded by beautiful spirits, angels, who are guiding you. God is blessing you, beckoning you to a higher place, a place where the soul is joyful, fulfilled in Love, the Love Divine. We will seek it together, my daughter, dear child of truth. We will seek it together.

My love is with you. I see you, your beautiful light. I know you and I am close. I am Yogananda. My love for you is great, dear child of truth. Continue on your journey and we will find the wonders of God’s universe together. God bless you in His love. God bless you in the great Love of the universe.
