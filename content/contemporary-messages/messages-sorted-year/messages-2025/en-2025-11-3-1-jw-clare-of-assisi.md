# In the Silence

November 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Fairfax, VA, USA

Clare of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

The many here will be with you in your time together, giving you our blessing, encouraging you to go deep in your prayers, and allowing the joy of the love of God in your souls to guide you. I can tell you, there is much to be accomplished in silence as well as in speaking truth. For in the silence, the still small voice of the Creator comes through, and you must listen as you send out the love in your souls to the world. You can do this in this circle of love that you have been guided to create. We will watch over you as you pray for guidance. Follow the promptings of your souls as to what to do, when, where, and perhaps at times even what not to do. But remember, all things done in love are good. All things done in the love of God are gracious. Take time in the silence, be mindful of your speech, and encourage one another.

In the days ahead, it is our great hope that each one not only receives a great inflowing of Divine Love but also great guidance as to your walk into the future; what you wish to take with you, what you wish to leave behind, and where you feel your influence can make a difference.

We are very busy encouraging these circles of light around the planet at this time. Coming together physically creates a bond that carries with it great possibilities.

In the love of God, there is healing. Pray for those who are not at ease, who are misguided, that they may receive our influence, for we so wish for peace to pervade the planet, for the hungry to be fed, for the homeless to be sheltered, and for every longing soul to be at one in the Father’s love.

We ask you to take your time, do not rush, allow this blessing to come into this sacred place and into your immortal souls, that you will be changed, and this world will be blessed.

We shall be with you in this time, and we love you. Go with God, and may his love enfold you in the great peace.

I am your sister, in Christ, and your friend on the path of roses. God bless you.

I am Clare.
