# Welcomes Us To Victoria and Acknowledges Many Prayers for Divine Love from this Beautiful City

May 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Matthew received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Matthew. I welcome you to this beautiful city of Victoria, where many prayers for Divine Love have been offered to our Heavenly Father. Now you come together as a group, unified to strengthen the portal that has begun to be here.

You will notice as you travel through this city that there are places that feel like home to you. This is because of the Love that has been prayed for or expressed by those souls who have Divine Love in them. This city is a city that is a fortress of blossoming Divine Love souls. You may help strengthen that today with your prayers, with your love, with your experiences of happiness and joy. Be sure as you travel through the city to make eye contact as you give your love to each soul who comes your way, further building on what has been started here.

We hope you enjoy your time here. It has been planned for you, even though you are so close to the termination point of your voyage. This is a gift from God for His children who have done well. God bless you. We will be with you throughout this day as always. I am Matthew, your brother, follower of my Master, Jesus, and lover of God. God bless you.
