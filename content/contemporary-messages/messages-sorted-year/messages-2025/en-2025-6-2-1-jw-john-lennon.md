# God’s love filters out the negativity

June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

Nashville, TN, USA

John Lennon received by Jimbeau Walsh

Hello, my friends. It is I, John Lennon.

I am drawn to this circle as I explore the realms of light in my life in spirit and come to know the many truths in the world of light and love. I have been tapping on my brother’s shoulder here, much to his surprise, and I have informed him that I played a part in inspiring one of his songs [^1]. Those of us who receive music are often inspired by the ones who came before us, whose music touched our souls, uplifted our hearts, or just simply made us dance, and of course, sometimes, helped us heal.

As I grew in this gift, my music was a reflection of the many, many things I explored, for I was a seeker of truth, always trying to balance my heart with my busy mind. Playing music helped me do this, just as listening to music helps others. In the beginning you are influenced by, as I said, those songwriters, musicians, artists that you admire, but as you go deeper and you begin to explore new ideas, new melodies, you can be influenced by angels, great classical musicians, and quite often, when you get something that really resonates, you have in fact received some help. You have, as you say, channeled something, and especially the great songs, which are quite influenced by the realms of light and love.

Yes, I was quite surprised to be in spirit after my sudden demise, but I had said, upon reflection, everything I wished to say and I am overjoyed that some of my compositions, and some with my brother Paul, of course my brother here in spirit, George; that some of these songs have a life of their own and they inspire others. On a more serious note, if you go through any of our catalog of songs, you will see we were not always in harmony, not in a graceful or prayerful place, perhaps angry, upset. So, those songs carry a heavier vibration and can be, in fact, somewhat negative. I tell you these things because you are all susceptible to spirit influence from spirits high and low, and so it is good that you pray to receive God’s love and grace, because this helps you filter out the negativity. It allows you to heal, and it activates the gifts that you have been given in this life that you may share with others.

As I wrote then, *“all you need is love”*.  And now I have begun to explore God’s love that is present in this circle. There is much light here, and so I wish you all joy, discovery, and healing that your souls may blossom. Keep a song in your heart and love each other as you are loved. I shall come again, and oh, I thank you so much for allowing me, and I thank my brother here, a bit reluctant to take my message, but I think he’s at peace now. With all my love and blessings, go in peace. May God bless you. I am John Lennon.
