# We Are Part of the Lattice of Light for the World

January 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Matthew received by Al Fike

You are part of a society that knows the blessing of the Father's Love, are conscious of it and practise receiving it on a daily basis. This group is small but it is powerful. My beloved friends, I am Matthew. You come together, seeking the great gift and joining with us all, all in the universe, all in the Celestial Heavens, who know of this gift, this great blessing that is given to you freely by God.

When you are part of this society, this grouping of souls, you have a great advantage of their connection and their blessings of light that you may draw upon. Together as a group, you are coming to know each other and to forge the bonds of love together. This too is a great advantage, the strength of which you may draw upon even when you are not together.

It is important that you realise that with the soul, the distance and time do not matter. Indeed, these bonds of love and this network of light that continues to grow and strengthen is active and blessing you at every moment. Be receptive to this and be aware, especially when you feel that you are alone or lonely, that this great agent of love continues to be active, continues to connect and continues to be your friend, so that when you are praying, that active blessing is with you and consciously so. When you are contemplating truth and setting your goals and your thoughts to higher things, you also activate this bond, these blessings, and you nurture these blessings in your activation.

Beloved souls, you are part of a network, a beautiful society of souls that acts in alignment with God. The more you are awakened in Love, the further the process of transformation goes and the more you are able to contribute to this great network. In time, with those you have bonded with on the earthly plane, you will come to know their thoughts and their intentions toward you. You will come to realise on a conscious level that they are thinking of you. I would urge you, when that happens to you, for you to think of them, to send them love as they are sending you love. This too reinforces the network. This too is a precursor to more in-depth communication and ability to truly work together and navigate this world together.

We are helping you to develop these things. There are capacities within your brain that will allow this type of communication. There are most certainly capacities within the soul that will recognise and foster this form of communication. So, when you say you wish to develop your ability to communicate with your angel friends, you are also developing your ability to communicate with one another and with the society of souls on Earth who are diligent and focused upon the development of their soul.

You see, God brings many blessings with His Love. It ignites many things. Indeed, the capacities, the potentials, are there within each one of you and all who participate. In time, this network of beautiful souls upon your Earth will have this blessing, the sense of togetherness, of closeness, of communication, of the flow of love one to another, helping to reinforce not only your journey upon the earthly plane, but also reinforce your instrumentality on the earthly plane.

As the dear daughter said yesterday, when one steps forward, all step forward. It is a law that when these bonds are forged and each one contributes and is intent on soul development and awakening, they are benefiting their brothers and sisters and their brothers and sisters are benefiting them. This network, although not material, not often recognised by the material mind, is definitely part of the spirit mind and means of communication and understanding. This intermediary between the soul and the material mind, does you a great service in its capacities to be a bridge between the two conscious selves. It will do so as you grow more sensitive It is the spirit consciousness of mind that will become very evident. Your intuition will grow, my friends. You will come to understand who you are and how you are made by God, this beautiful, intricate interlacing capacities and gifts that you possess.

So, we are together once again. Some have a greater capacity and sensitivity to understand our presence, feeling us. Feel it and know it. Others are struggling. But, indeed, as you sit together in this Circle of Light, you are helping one another to progress and to experience these aspects of your own sensitivity. Indeed, many layers, many blessings, come to you as you forge these bonds together, forge your bond with God and with us. The unity emerges as you continue to pray together and be together.

May you be blessed, my beloved friends, in the great and wondrous gift of the Father's Love. May you be blessed in coming to know and love one another and to honour one another. For each is a unique creation of God and has much to give to the world, much to give. You have not truly exercised your potential yet, but this is coming. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Matthew and I love you, beautiful souls of God. I love you and I am a part of you. God bless you.
