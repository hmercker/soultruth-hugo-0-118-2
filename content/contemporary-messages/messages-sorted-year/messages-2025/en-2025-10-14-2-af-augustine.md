# Confront That Which Holds You Back from Being God's Instrument of Light

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you. It is your teacher, Augustine. Indeed, plans are afoot. You have made your plans. We have made our plans. God has made His plans. The great challenge, of course, is to coordinate and bring into alignment these plans, these intentions, between yourselves, us and God. As you would well imagine, our intentions and plans are very much in alignment with God. Our ability to listen to guidance and to know God's Will is greatly enhanced because our souls are transformed in Divine Love. All earthly conditions, all conditions of the mind, have been eradicated or absorbed by this Love.

Yet, you are not in that position. You do not have the ability and the clear understanding that would bring you in complete alignment with God's Will, so you must put great effort into bringing yourselves, and that includes all of you, into alignment with God's Will. You must look at what holds you back from this. Often there are residues of emotional trauma and traumas of life that have greatly influenced your perspective and your perceptions. Your emotional well-being is somewhat vulnerable to these things and your mind often is used in a way to control and to stifle any painful feelings, thoughts and memories that you may have. This is the way of your world, to stifle and to put aside those conditions that continue to bedevil you.

My beautiful students, if you are to be a clear channel for God, a beautiful instrument of love and light, then these conditions and these biases of mind must be eradicated. You must walk in the truth and walk in the purity of love. You cannot do so when you hide from those conditions that prevent you from this. You must find your way through that maze of memory, of feeling, of encrustations of the soul and extreme biases of the mind. These things need purification, recalibration and rectification. It cannot happen if you are resistant, constantly resistant, of these things that hold you into the earthly conditions. We are not expecting you to be a redeemed soul while on Earth, although this would certainly be a wonderful thing, but we do expect you to be free of those major conditions, those severe conditions, those traumatic conditions that hold you back in life. We want you to be free, free of all that impinges upon your light, your happiness and joy, free of the error, free of all that which inhibits you as a channel of light in the world.

As I speak to you, I know you are well aware of these things within you and there are things that you are not aware of. Yet, as you progress upon this path, my beloved and beautiful students, that awareness will come. It must come, for the soul speaks to the mind and says, *“These things are inhibiting us. These things are holding us back and weighing us down, preventing us from truly loving ourselves, loving God and loving humanity.”* They must be seen, acknowledged and released. These expiations are required.

My beloved friends, I do not suggest that you immerse yourself in these things, this darkness. I suggest, however, that when they rise up within you, when you are aware of them, do not push them back, do not hide away, but confront them head on. Confront them with prayer. Confront them with the desire to release them. Confront them with compassion, forgiveness and love. When you do so and those residues of conditions remain, with the power that you have created within yourself, the power of love, light, wisdom and intention, what remains will be washed away readily and with a great sigh of relief. For indeed, when these things are gone, you will feel that lightness of being that will bring you joy and true freedom.

You know very well of the things I speak, for they have been spoken of often. Yet indeed, I remind you, beloved souls, that the journey of purification is not complete. There is still more work to do. There are still more things to see and to acknowledge within you. None of you is at that place of purity. Some are closer than others, but indeed, the work continues. As usual, I am the one designated to bring those hard lessons forward for your benefit, to speak of the things that may not necessarily uplift you, but to speak of the truth always.

Your teacher, Augustine, continues to speak, as he does, of things both beautiful and things that are not beautiful. Yet, these things reside within you, both light and dark, and you must release the dark if you are truly to be God's instruments in the world. Indeed, a pure soul is a powerful soul. A pure soul is receptive to greater blessings, the inflow of God's Love, the blessings of healing and light, the blessings of truth, wisdom. We wish for you to be in that condition, that place of receptivity, of strength, of courage, a powerful expression of truth. This way, when the time comes for you to be a part of this great plan in a more overt way, you will be ready. You will be capable of confronting any condition that may hold you back from your true purpose.

You all are beautiful lights and you all struggle to continue in that light and beauty, but you are growing step by step, moment by moment, day by day. In this incremental way, you continue to grow, become strong and clear and wise and beautiful. We are together, continuing upon this journey, this process of transformation. We mark our progress and we continue with integrity, honesty and authenticity, truth and all the goodness and strength that is within you. May your souls indeed grow, prosper and expand in the Father's Love. We will reach that goal of true instrumentality, pure and beautiful. We come ever closer and we are truly God's children on this journey of awakening.

God bless you, beloved souls. Your teacher, Augustine, loves you dearly and seeks to encourage you and propel you into further growth and awakening and light. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
