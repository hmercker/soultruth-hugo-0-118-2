Jesus received by Al Fike

May the blessings of the Father's Love be yours, beloved children of truth. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come today to be with you in prayer, to speak to you of truth and to love you each one.

For we are brethren, brothers and sisters all, on this great journey of discovering God and discovering our souls, which long to be with God. You represent a movement of truth and light that the world does not know of yet but will know. The attitudes and understanding of your brothers and sisters will change rapidly as God's plan is implemented and fulfilled. You, my beloved brothers and sisters, must carry the banner, speak of how great Godâ€™s Love for each is and every one of His creations, His souls created to journey toward light, truth and harmony.

May you be the harbingers of truth. May you live that truth in all its ways, means and expressions, that the Truth of Love is the highest truth of all and what comes of this great blessing within your soul will bring to you greater truth, deeper truth and expansive truth. As your souls grow and are transformed in this Love, so your perceptions deepen, your capacity for truth becomes a natural expression of your soul and your being. The love that will flow from you to others will bring great comfort to many. As you follow the Truth that I once taught and continue to teach, so you become my disciples, so you keep this Truth alive by your being an expression of it.

Each of you is needed as God's instruments of light and truth in the world. Yet, many of you continue to hold back, to be somewhat reticent and shy in expressing the beautiful light and power that is within you. Yet, as you grow in the Father's Love, as the wisdom flourishes within your soul, as you come to recognise that part of you that is claimed by God and shall continue to be in the Light and Truth of God's Love, then the ease of expression, the ease of your instrumentality, bringing light to those in need, will continue to deepen and broaden in ways that will surprise you.

The foundation of service is to give what is needed in the world that will bring greater harmony to another, a blessing of love, of giving, of acknowledgement. These things are most important. If you may speak of the truth to another, may the words that you use, the expression upon your face, the countenance that you carry, serve to inspire their soul to awaken to God, to be in harmony with the Laws of Love and the Laws of Creation. That they may realise that they have the potential to be an eternal soul claimed by the great blessing that God has to give. That they may realise that life in your world is but a drop in the ocean of continued life. That they may realise the depth and breadth of God's Love for them and how that Love is eternal and shall bring you upon the eternal path.

You know of these truths, my beloved brethren. You are continuing to be awakened to these truths as you grow in Love. Hold steadfast to the yearnings, experiences and expressions of your soul. In this way, you will be guided forth in a life that will be unexpected, filled with promise and potential that God wishes to be fulfilled. It is for you, my beloved brethren, to truly have faith in the journey of at-onement with God. You will find yourself on a road firm, resplendent in light, filled with joy and the opportunity to be with many other souls, many who are seeking, many who are in need of your gifts and your light. You fulfil God's promise to the world to be a light and for the world to be lit in harmony and love.

Fulfil the desires and expectations of the soul, a soul that knows that God is with him and loves him, a soul that is in harmony with the laws that bring God close and the light bright all around you and within you. Be true to the journey that God has set before you and you will know no want. You will not feel bereft of love or purpose. You will not be lonely. You will not have those feelings of desperation so common in your world. The power of God's Love will not only awaken you but heal you, transform you and bring you to greater truth. It is given freely by God, but it must be desired and asked for in your prayers, your longings and your thoughts. As you continue to sustain this desire, to hone your prayers toward God, then all that I speak of is yours for the taking. It is given with the abundance and generosity of God's great Soul and shall not be withheld but given freely.

May you continue to be in the light, my beloved brethren. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I walk with you. You are precious to me. You are precious in the world, and you are precious to God. Acknowledge this within your hearts and see that your choice to find the liberation of your soul in Love is the highest choice and desire that can be had in your world and in mine. God bless you, beloveds. I love you. I love you dearly. I bring the blessing of peace to each one of you as we enter that great hall and feel the benefits of its blessings. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
