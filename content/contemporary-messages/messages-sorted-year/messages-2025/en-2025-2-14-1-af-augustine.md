# Valentine’s Day Message for All

February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

It is somewhat amusing that one day in the year is dedicated to love, when indeed every day of the year needs to be dedicated to love. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to encourage you, not only in the expression of natural love within you, but in the expression of the Divine Love that is growing within your souls. For in time, this Love that you carry within your souls will overshadow and absorb the natural love that you possess, the capacities for love that you express.

It is the way of Divine Love to transform and absorb everything that you are, to make it into that which is divine, rather than that which is all too mortal, human and natural. This is what God has given to you, this opportunity to seek, grow and expand beyond your natural capacities and to be fully awakened in the Divine Love of God, His Essence shining through within you, His Essence transforming you and making you into a Celestial being, rather than a mortal.

I know it has been said many times that it is almost impossible to become a divine Celestial being while on the Earth. But, indeed, it is possible. Our beloved Master has demonstrated this and, there have been, on the rarest of occasions, individuals who have progressed to the Seventh Sphere from the Earth plane. To go directly into the Celestial Kingdom is indeed something that has never happened, for even Jesus must have and did enter the Seventh and then created the Celestial Kingdom for himself and all who follow him.

We are blessed to have these Heavens available to us, you on Earth and us in the spirit world. We have benefited greatly from what Jesus has created and, subsequently, what other beautiful, bright souls have created, making the Celestial Kingdom a place so beyond our definition, so beyond anything we can describe to you, that you must indeed strive and come to that place of entering therein in order to truly experience and see for yourself the wonderment and the beauty of true Heaven.

In the meantime, we bring our blessings to you, beloved souls. We bring our love to you. God continues to pour His Love within your souls as you seek it and the Holy Spirit conveys it to you. My beloved and beautiful students, there is nothing higher worth seeking, nothing greater worth having than this gift. It transcends all other loves. It transcends all other experiences. It is the greatest gift given. Indeed, as you honour love on this day, honour God, for God has offered His Love for you as a gift, as something that you may hold for eternity and something that will continue to accumulate as you seek it for eternity.

It is given freely, beloved souls. It is given to every soul who seeks it. It is given because God loves each of His children. We are together in this Circle of Light, this beautiful place of love, opening and seeking the benediction from the Hand of God. So, we are blessed. We recognise the power of love, the beauty of love and the wonderment that is God's Love, that is sent to every soul. It is for them to receive, to open and to accept. Our prayers are for this to be so, as our prayers are for you to be open and receive it, to truly know it and live within the grace of God.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I love you so, each one. May you know the gift, the Heart of Love, the Light that God sheds upon you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. Augustine loves you. God bless you.
