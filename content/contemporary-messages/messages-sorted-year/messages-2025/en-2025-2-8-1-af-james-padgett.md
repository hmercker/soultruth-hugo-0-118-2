# Urges a Review of the Volumes of Messages He Received from Jesus to Strengthen Rapport and Knowledge of Spiritual Laws

James Padgett received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, dear friends who sojourn upon the Path Divine, seeking the highest and greatest blessings of all. I have come to encourage you to read passages in [the books](https://new-birth.net/padgetts-messages/the-padgett-messages-from-the-true-gospel-revealed-anew-by-jesus/) that have been created through my efforts as a medium, through the efforts of the Celestial spirits and through Jesus himself, to explain the path of love, to explain the new world that is a reflection of that path.

It is important for you to continue to open your minds and open your souls to these truths so that you might understand the journey that is required, that you may understand the laws that are in action upon this path, that you may understand how you might make the choices required to truly be qualified to walk upon this path.

The answers lie in these books. I do not suggest you read every passage, every book, but if you take these books in hand and ask to be guided as to what to read, you can be assured that your guides and gatekeepers will direct you to the passages that need to be read and reviewed.

None of you are so educated, so refined in your understanding of these things, that a review is unnecessary. I urge you forward in this review. I urge you to seek out the passages that will help you understand more fully and will put your mind at rest as you continue to open to new passageways of experience, understanding and wisdom.

May you be blessed upon your efforts. May you come to know your angel friends who are there to help. In the exercise of this review, it will also help you come to know your angel friends in a better way, in an easy way. That awareness opens more readily and propitiously as you learn and are within the grace of the Father's Love. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. I am James. I am happy to be with you today. God bless you.
