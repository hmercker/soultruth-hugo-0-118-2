# You have crossed the Rubicon

June 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Florida Retreat, Inverness, FL, USA

Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother, Judas.

I come with many in your band. We come in the love of God to guide you, to watch over you, to protect you during this time you have chosen to come together, to praise God, and to seek the inflowing of His love.

Each one here has set aside a portion of their world to be in communion, Holy communion, in this grace, in this love. During this time, we ask you to minimize your distractions, to share freely, to open up from the depths of your souls, for whatever you put in, in time, you will reap ten times in blessings. You have crossed the Rubicon from darkness into light, from the world into heaven. You have put first prayer for the love of God. You have kept close to this, and I ask you, do not fault yourselves, for when you have seemed to take a step backwards, for all will stumble in this world of yours. It is a struggle to not only make ends meet at times but to stay in oneness, your soul with the soul of God. And at times, you feel disconnected, and sometimes it can be an extreme of feeling apart from the love of God, but this, of course, is never true. The love of God is always here.

Turn your attention to the longings in your souls. Allow your heart’s desire to be fulfilled. Let your mind take a step back, that your soul be in ascendancy, that your soul may guide you beyond the whims and wishes of your mind. We shall come these days, your band, and many of us will come to this group. And so, we will share our wisdom, our blessings, as you share your wisdom, your gifts, your blessings with each other, and in this way, in the oneness, in the love, in grace, in light, we shall be one.  As the song goes, leave your troubles at the doorstep, and walk on the sunny side of the street. Walk in the light and love of God.

My dear friends, be not concerned for any outcome, for all things you do in grace are good, and God’s grace is the highest good. I shall step back with the many here who love you, who embrace you, who delight in your soul’s journey to the fountainhead of God’s love. We are one. I am your brother and eternal friend.

I am Judas. May God bless us all.
