# Overcoming Obstacles of Raising Children

I am Orion. I come once again to speak. Your world is full of obstacles and barriers that prevent you from being in light, joy and happiness, something that God wants for every soul, not only on your planet, but all planets. I speak to what becomes a barrier and how you may approach these challenges.

Every soul who is born into this planet inherits a prescribed pattern and group of behaviours that are often not in alignment with love. Certainly most, if not all, children are loved, that love is very conditional. A parent takes very seriously what they need to do in order to condition the child toward behaviours that are socially acceptable. Often, however, the price that is paid is withholding love. Some rationalise this by saying, in their disciplinary ways, it is love.

Yet, the conditions, perspectives and patterns of behaviour are merely things that have been passed down through generations, seeking to create order in society and order amongst themselves, but not necessarily harmony. Rather, it is a condition of obedience. This creates fear. In essence, the parent, though feeling that they are doing what is necessary and right, often creates fear within the child. It is a way of control and of conditioning.

In the very beginning, you are hobbled in your spirituality. The conditions that you deal with as an innocent and vulnerable child do not necessarily bring about the flourishing of the soul, the happiness of the soul, the joy of the soul. From there, there is an uphill battle. As conditions intensify, social relationships multiply and the expectations of the world continue to put pressure upon each individual to comply with the norm.

Thus, layers upon layers of expectation, of conditioning, of patterns of behaviour, of fear, of many, many thoughtful inclinations continue to pose barriers between you and your soul. The only way to truly know God is to know your own soul. Thus, you are inhibited and become inclined toward the human condition rather than that of the soulful desires realised in prayer and connection with the Creator. It is not that you lack teachers in this regard. For beautiful souls have entered into your world and taught truth, light and harmony. Unfortunately, many of these things are then twisted and turned into what is acceptable, dogma and idealism, that brings more of this behavioural norm.

Your world is encased in that which is not truly of universal truth. Your struggles are great to go beyond these inherited conditions and imposed expectations upon each of you. Yet, you have one great and beautiful blessing that helps you and uplifts you from these conditions. This is the power of the Essence of God working within you. It is working within your soul, strengthening, brightening and clearing away the conditions that are not in harmony with God's creation.

You also carry and uphold those conditions that you were born into. It creates a great struggle. Indeed, each of you are well aware of this struggle. We have told you of the foundations of this struggle quite completely. The intricacies of human behaviour are well known to you. Yet, you are continuing to go against the flow of these conditions. You desire liberation from them. You desire to be free and in harmony with the laws that you have been taught, shown and experienced.

Each day brings you an opportunity to challenge your old ways of thinking, these conditions that I speak of. For with self-awareness, you may see for yourself the behaviours that you exhibit that inhibit your relationship with God and your relationship with yourself. Each day brings its unique opportunities for self-awareness, for correction, to choose love over judgement, fear or darkness. Each day opens the door as a gift  to see more clearly the challenges that you face.

These challenges are not the same with each individual, but are similar. Thus, you come together for mutual support and for the blessings of God. You recognise in one another the struggles that you carry and those things that inhibit you from truly being free. Indeed, you are blessed with your angel friends, stellar friends, bright spirits and the many, many who gather around you to help you to release yourselves from these conditions. I urge you to see life each day, even in conditions that are challenging, as a blessing, a gift. If you approach these things from the perspective of learning, growing, understanding yourself, understanding the ways of the world and applying the correction and the love required to release yourself from these conditions, then you are truly blessed.

You are given a great gift, a gift that many do not have, not because that gift is withdrawn from them or kept from them. It is because they do not understand. They live in great ignorance. They do not care because they do not know what to care about. You have decided to be conscientious, desiring to go higher in your spiritual growth and development, to seek the great Love of God to awaken your soul. These are lofty aspirations and they are very uncommon indeed. Yet, here we are, my friends. Here we are, walking on a road that challenges you almost with every breath, walking on a road that blesses you and benefits you with every breath.

Yes, the dichotomy is intense. The difficulties are not easy to overcome, but God ensures that you have all opportunities, all benefits and upliftment to bring you to that place of purity, to put aside the ways learned as a child and to grow into what is truly a mature adult, one who chooses well and with love. Our hope is that, reflexively, you will choose these things and that those old patterns will fade, for they lack the fuel that keeps them alive. That your thought patterns, behaviours, feelings and perceptions will reflect that which is truly being developed and evolving within you, within your soul and your mind, within all of you. This light penetrates, infiltrates and brings greater harmony to you as you choose to align yourself with this rather than acquiesce to the old ways of being.

We are with you each and every day. We help to bring our life and protection, to help influence, to help you to be strong and to choose accordingly. You have free will, so you must choose. Yet, you are also blessed with an atmosphere and environment around you that is conducive toward choosing harmony and light. Even when your loved ones tempt you and press upon you with their conditions and their choices, the wisdom of your soul continues to exercise its power to choose otherwise, to choose the light.

I merely remind you. I know you continue to be reminded almost continuously of these challenges that you face, not only from us, but from your life lived. These challenges continue to intensify as the conditions of the Earth continue to intensify in darkness. You face many challenges, my friends. You are often on the horns of a dilemma. You continue to fight for light, harmony and truth. You continue to urge yourself forward. You continue to seek the help of God and all your friends.

This is the right choice. For as you continue in these struggles and continue to seek to rise up above them, you will draw these forces even closer. You are building within you a strength that continues to grow. You are blessed, my friends, in ways that you do not even understand or imagine. You are blessed and will continue to be blessed as you continue to struggle, choose the light, choose the blessings and choose to behave, think and do in harmony with the laws that are truly of God's creation, God's universe.

We are with you. We have great compassion for you. We also have great love for you. That love will continue to flow ceaselessly and abundantly, not only from God, but from those around you, to uplift, uphold, protect, to teach, show the way and inspire. You are given all that can be given. It is for you to receive and then to act.

May you be blessed, my friends. You are truly loved. I am Orion. God bless you.
