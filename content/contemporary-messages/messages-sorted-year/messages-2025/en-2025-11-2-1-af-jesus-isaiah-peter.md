Jesus, Isaiah & Peter received by Al Fike

**Jesus:** May the great blessing of the Father's Love be yours. I come to be with you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you and to minister upon you, along with all the angels of the Celestial Heavens. Through your prayers and desires, the longings of your soul, you open the floodgates of these blessings as the Holy Spirit comes and touches your soul. With this gift and blessing, the Celestial Angels also come to be with each one of you.

Indeed, you open the floodgates, my beloveds, for you seek the highest blessing that can be given, the greatest journey that can be taken, that which is eternal and that which will continue to grow and be added unto each one of you. My beloveds, know and feel the yearnings of your soul as it reaches to God, for the soul knows its Creator. The soul is aware of God. As you make that conscious prayer, clearing away all obstructions between you and God, so the blessings flow. The door is opened and the soul continues its journey towards redemption and healing.

My beloveds, we are all brothers and sisters upon this path of truth. We will walk together for eternity. It is my fervent wish that all who pray here and around the world may know of this gift, for as they ask in a conscious way, in a true desire, so they will receive it. They too will begin the journey of an eternal at-onement with God. Speak of this Truth to your brothers and sisters. Speak of the journey. Speak of your own experience upon this path. Speak of your love of God, your friendship with me and the angels and all who are in alignment with this Truth. For they must know, my beloveds. So many in the world are ignorant of this truth and the possibilities of this blessing. They must know and make that choice for themselves.

Each of you are my disciples to bring this Truth forward. I urge you to speak and to demonstrate the truth. I urge you to walk this path with every breath and be that channel of love, God's instrument of peace in the world. Together, we will assist God in His great plan for the salvation of humanity. Each has their contribution to make. Each may put forward their prayers for humanity. Each will be inspired and guided to serve God in the ways designated and planned. Each day is the opportunity to do so. Be true to the longings of your soul. Be true to God's Will for you and be that light in the world, for the world desperately needs you all to be the harbingers, to point the way to the true salvation of the soul and of humanity.

Every brother and sister, every child and all the spirits who are alive and seeking must know of this Truth and must awaken to their soul's longings for it and deliver those longings to God to receive the gift that is so freely given, that they may be transformed and awakened in the Father's Love. We pray together, my beloveds, that the world may be awakened and that all the suffering and darkness, ignorance and pain may be expunged from this world, replaced with light and love and truth. It is a tall order for God, but it is not a thing that God is incapable of fulfilling. Our God, the power of God's blessings, the power of God's Will, the power of His Laws in action, the power of your prayers and the power of free will may all conspire to bring the healing needed and the awakening of every soul. This is God's desire and may it be yours, my beloveds. May it be yours.

I am your brother and friend Jesus, and I come to speak plainly and of the truth to each of you and to the world. My love for each of you and all of humanity is great. I continue to work tirelessly for the salvation of humanity. I have gathered my flock together to speak to you of the truth and to assure you the truth may abide within you forevermore. My beloved beautiful brothers and sisters, we march forward, seeking to serve, seeking to love, seeking the light. God bless you. I am Jesus and my love is with you all. God bless you.

**Isaiah:** May the blessings of the Father's Love be with you. I am Isaiah. I stand with my brother to declare the truth and to bring the Light of God's Love in your midst in great abundance. All the angels of heaven seek for the reclamation and blessings for humanity. We work as one and desire to work with each one of you in this great effort to steer humanity towards light, to preempt the darkness and be in the joy of God's Love.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Isaiah and I come to pray with you.

**Peter:** I am Peter, known as Peter the Rock. I add my strength, prayers and love to all who speak and all who pray, for these things are needed in the world. We come to add our prayers, our light to yours, and we continue to work together, do we not?

Those of you who seek to serve God and serve humanity will find the ways and means to do so and will know the glories of God expressed within their souls, pushing out all that which is not of love and light. You are being redeemed at this moment and shall continue on the path of redemption for eternity and beyond into the glories, into the joy of the awakened and transformed soul. It has been given to each one of you as you walk this path towards at-onement with God. Be true to your soul and its desires to progress and to be in that great light of truth.

God bless you, beloved souls. Peter is with you, as are many, so many. The numbers who could speak to you at this moment would take far greater time than the time that you have together in prayer. I say to you, we all gather and we surround you in light, prayer and love. It is yours because you desire this. It is given because God wishes for it to be given. God bless you, beloveds. Open wide to this great gift. Feel the upliftment, the peace and the glory of God's Hand upon you. It is given. It is yours for the asking. God bless you. Peter loves you. God bless you.
