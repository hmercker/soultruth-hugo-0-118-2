Dear friends, I greet you. I am Alec. As your souls continue to reach out to God, to be open and receptive, you receive a mighty inflowing of that transforming Love, taking the nature of your soul in the image of God and transforming it into the Essence, the Divinity and the Substance of God. As you continue to traverse your spiritual walk, your demeanour and your disposition are changed. They become harmonious.

Your thoughts, your actions and your words are in alignment with what you carry within your soul. You can begin to perceive your soul more easily, hear its wisdom, speak its wisdom, and see through its eyes. Through love, you can see truth. You can have eyes of compassion and of wisdom. As you grow and strengthen through the awakening of your soul, your will also strengthens in its ability to express truth.

The will of your soul is in alignment with God's Will. God will always inform you, through your soul, His Will for you and through you. For in truth, it is God that is given the ability to move through you. The substance that you continue to receive now becomes a powerful emitter of truth, as it is a receptor for truth. Through your soul's progression in your human condition, these two parts of you come into alignment. There is a blending, a merging and an integration so that these parts of you are operating in concert, a beautiful symphony, for your soul longs to grow in its strength and ability as it develops and awakens.

You are learning to consciously choose light, to choose goodness, to lean into the centre of your being and to feel what is happening within you. In these changes, your stability strengthens. Your groundedness within your own soul develops. There is an awareness that you experience, through your material mind, the truth that is within your soul and the changes that you feel within you. At first, those promptings, the bubbling up of the soul's expression, can be very subtle. Yet, as you grow in Divine Love, so too does your soul's ability to express itself.

It is quite a remarkable undertaking that you are engaged in, because you are learning to flow through that inner essence. You are learning to filter all that you do through the filter of truth and through a filter of love and harmony. As you grow in this, you too grow in the ability to perceive God's Will for you. God's Will for you is in every breath. It is not set within some powerful experience in the public realm. We have said this before.

If your destiny is to be in these Realms, how is it that you get there? It is prayer by prayer, drop by drop of the Love flowing in and, again and again, choosing to be that instrument, that individual, to be a person of light. That is all you can do in any given moment, to align with that light that is within the soul and to keep your mind filled with thoughts of light. In this way, you will be successful in fulfilling God's Will that He has determined to perform through you. You have many hours in your day and many moments in your day. As you accumulate the strength to have all of this aimed toward higher thought, higher action and higher words, you are fulfilling a purpose and being a channel of light and of love.

Bring all that you are, this beautiful soul, the light that is within your soul and allow it to emit itself through you. Feel the flow of your soul's energy through your body, in your hands, in your heart centre, in your eyes, on your tongue, in your legs and your feet. Allow yourself to be moved through the spirit of your soul. In this way, beloved souls, you will be assured that you are doing and being who and what you are meant to be, a soul filled with Love, a soul bringing light to Earth.

More than that, your blessing is experiencing your awakening, experiencing the power of your soul, coming to know who you really are and coming to feel and witness from your conscious mind's perspective the power, the glory and the beauty that you have been created with.

Allow this to be your life's journey, being able to perceive your soul, knowing with faith that God is guiding you, informing you and is flowing all of His beautiful attributes to you and through you, using you as an instrument, as a channel and giving you the experience of what it means to be in union with God, aligned with the Divine. Pray, sincerely and earnestly. Release your soul from those inhibitors and grow in the experience of the light of your soul.

I am Alec. I join you in your yearnings and longings to receive our Heavenly Father's Love, as I end and say goodbye. God bless you.
