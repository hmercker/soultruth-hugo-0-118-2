# The Ways of the World and The Way of Divine Love

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear friends. It is I, your brother Yogananda.

I come in the love of God.

Looking out over the material world with discernment and in prayer, one can easily see the concerns of most, though not all. In places with higher standards of living, so to speak, the concerns are money, food, sex, material goods, and acquiring more. You can see this on the news. You can see it in movies. The frustration of those struggling for material comfort and wealth often leads to very inharmonious behaviors. And so you see, that is the theme of most films. Fortunately, there is a smattering of love, romantic love in general, or someone’s generous heart. But how often do you see someone discussing their soul beyond dogmatic belief? Revealing their wish to be transformed in the love of God?

We all wish for the vibrations of Divine Love to cut through the chaos, to cut through the in-harmonies, and as I have said, the vibration of Divine Love, of grace, outshines the darkness. So, you come together in prayer, knowing the secret, the secret of finding the treasure, opening to God, your soul to the Great Soul, letting go of the world, if even for a few moments, and allowing the light and the love to take precedence. This vibration is what the world needs and so we ask you when confronted with the darkness, to shine your light.

Forgive those who do not know. Did not the Master say, *”Father, forgive them for they know not what they do?”* Walk in grace, that you may bring this light to the world and as you walk together, exponentially create a larger light, a protective shield in the love of God, in the company of angels. We say do not fear because God is great.

Walk with us. Talk with us. Pray with us and stay with us. We, who love you with God’s love and God who loves you beyond your knowing. Feel this in your being and allow it to penetrate your souls. Be free. It is not that we don’t wish you to create a better material world, a more sustainable one, places of refuge, and healthier places. No, we encourage these things. But first and foremost, come into rapport with Grace. Open to the great inflowing and infilling of the Creator’s love, always there for you as we are.

Picture an image of a very rich person surrounded by many material things. Things of beauty, things that are treasured, precious gems and metals, beautiful clothes and imagine for a moment someone like that having not one drop of water to drink. One bite of food to sustain them. As is said, *“drink from the living waters. Imbibe the food of the soul”*  in God’s love.

With all my love and blessings to each one here and my brother here, who so wishes to be a good channel that all may benefit. I thank you all. May you go in the grace of God and in peace in His grace.

I am Yogananda. May God bless you.
