# It’s Important to Prepare for Changes Coming in the World

January 25<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Starpoint Retreat, Christ Church, Barbados

Jesus received by Al Fike

Changes are coming into your world, beloveds. It is important that you are prepared,  equipped with the strength of the soul to help you navigate these changes, to help you thrive in a world that will be different, will reflect more readily the creation that it is meant to be and the creation that you are meant to be.

I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come to uphold you, to love you and to give you this message that the world will change and that change is meant to be. God has decreed that the desecration of His creation will cease, that humanity will be humbled, but will also be blessed and shown the way toward light and harmony.

We come close to you, beloved souls, so that we might assist you to understand how you might change with the world in harmony and in the direction that the world is going, that you may find yourself understanding why these changes are coming and why they are manifest, that you may come to have deep compassion for yourself, for humanity and for the world. This comes with the grace of God bestowing the virtues, the blessings and the perceptions that are a part of His Love, His Essence flowing into your soul. We come to encourage you to open yourselves, to be in harmony with the Truth of God's Love and discover these Truths for yourself for the great blessings that they are.

I come. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens. I come in love. I come with deep concern for every child who inhabits this Earth, that they may find refuge in God while all about them may come great change and disruption.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. You are my brothers and my sisters. We shall endeavour to walk the path of light together and be strong in the face of winds of change, gathering storms and conditions that reflect disharmony. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you all. It is with your families, your loved ones and with this world. God bless you and keep you in His Love. I love you. I shall love you forever.
