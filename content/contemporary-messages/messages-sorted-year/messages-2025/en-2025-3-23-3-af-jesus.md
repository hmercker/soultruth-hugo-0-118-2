Jesus received by Al Fike

You bring blessings to the world, my beloveds. Through your prayers come the blessings of the Creator, for you and for your loved ones, your families and for this world.

I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come to be with you in prayer, to help bring a greater measure of blessings to your world so in need of these blessings. As you pray with innocence, joy, desire and willingness, you do not know, can you possibly discern, how far reaching are your prayers and your efforts together. For the angels are sent to many as you become part of that great conduit of beauty, light and truth that flows from God to your world.

Many are blessed because of your prayers and your collective efforts to bring greater light to the world. Many will feel uplifted this day, this moment, because of this. Each of you are an intricate part of a great web of light that flows out into the world and touches many. Through the intensity and depth of your dedications, faith and desire to be servants of God, this makes possible the far-reaching effects and blessings that come.

My beloveds, we are together in a great effort to help uplift your world, to help bless and replenish many and to bring the nurturance of the soul as God's instruments to the many who are at this moment in need and in prayer. You are the blessed ones, for you come to this consciously and with deep desire. Indeed, as you continue to grow in this Love, this great blessing that is God's Essence, the perceptions and understanding of the power and beauty of this blessing will come to you. You will see how it is the mainstay of your life. It is that which is the great strength, the great Light, the great wisdom, the great Love that fuels your efforts in the world, your desires and your thoughts, as you move in the world as a light.

God is using you to bless many, as He does at this moment. God gathers you together to create this formidable force and this blessing. God will continue to do so. As you are willing and as you participate in these Circles of Light, these prayers that are meant for many, so God will utilise the opportunity that you create with your choice and your desire to pray together. It is important that you realise how powerful your efforts are and how wonderful is the light that comes. For you are truly being God's instruments at this moment. You are truly a light for the world, each of you, my beloveds.

We join together, you in the flesh and we in spirit, to make a difference, to bring a change, a blessing, an opening, to bring comfort, healing, love and peace to the world. You do your part, my beloveds. For this, you are blessed. We continue to work toward the upliftment and the regeneration of your world in light, truth and love, that the world might live in peace and that the generations to come might know a beautiful life, filled with love, filled with the glories and blessings of God and filled with that which is in harmony with God's Laws of Creation and God's Laws of Love.

Pray for this, my beloveds. Pray for humanity. Pray for this world, that indeed what is needed to bring change shall come, what is necessary to remove from this world shall be taken away and that which is in alignment with God's Will shall prevail. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Jesus. I come once again to pray with you, be with you and to bring light to this world of yours. God bless you. My love is with you always. God bless you.
