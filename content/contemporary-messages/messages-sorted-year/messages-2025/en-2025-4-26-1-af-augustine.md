# Humility Before Ego

April 26<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Running Springs Retreat, Running Springs, CA, USA

Augustine received by Al Fike

I am your teacher, Augustine. Our dear brother is eager to hear from me and so I am here. This is a formidable group arrayed together in a Circle of Light, one that has the power to change the world, though you may not see how you could do such a thing. Of course, you as individuals could not, but as you pray to be used as an instrument of God, the gifts and potentials that are within each one of you could be used to the great benefit of humanity. The question is, how can I be used?

Some of you are very eager to hear that answer. First and foremost, it is important that you listen to your soul and listen to God. For without this relationship, clear and vital within you, how can you do God's Will? How can you move in the world as God's instruments if you do so blindly, if you do so motivated by your mind and the intentions of your mind? It is the power of the soul, infused with the great gift of God's Love, that can change the world. It is not the power of your mind. Some of you possess very powerful minds that will bring to you the capacities to be those instruments that you are eager to be. Of course, the mind has its part to play, but it is not a primary player. Rather, it allows the instrumentality of the soul to be manifest in the physical, with the words spoken that are guided and inspired and with the actions made that allow you to move in the world. When these things are combined with humility and grace, then there is the capacity to move as a light, a beautiful channel for God.

Humility is a crucial factor, for the mind does not tend toward humility. The mind tends toward dominance, power, control, facts and figures, the dissection and understanding of the material world. This is where the mind is predominant and shines well within many of you. You are able to bring through many ideas and facts pertaining to the material world. Yet, you seek to be somewhat different. You seek to be an instrument of God. God has given you the ways and means of instrumentality, not with the mind per se, but with the soul and that soul's perceptions. When you are able to attune yourself to your soul and be disciplined enough to put your mind aside and not dominate your consciousness, then you are well on your way to fulfilling that desire that is deep within you, to serve God and to serve humanity. Indeed, with prayer and humility, desire, discipline and love, you will walk this world as a light, as a formidable figure, bringing love, comfort, truth, healing and light to the world.

It is for you to discern, to understand and to enable your beautiful souls to be that light. Be persistent in your prayers. Be consistent in your behaviour that is in harmony with God. Was Jesus a figure of great power and oratory skills? Was he a gentle and beautiful helper and channel for God, bringing peace and healing to many? His words were simple. He spoke in parables and ways that others could understand, but he did not force upon others that understanding. He merely walked as an example of the Father's Will, the way of Love and the way of the soul. This is what you must understand and express in all the fullness that you are able.

It is challenging, I know, especially for those of you who have minds that are so replete in its capacities to bring facts and details forward. This is not the way of God. This is the way of man. You must learn the ways of God, my beautiful, beautiful brothers and sisters. If you can do so, you may be used in many different ways, in many different situations and with many different souls. If you cannot overcome the impediments of the mind, then your instrumentality will be somewhat mediocre and those you reach will be far and few between. Now is the time to step forward, to challenge yourself, to be in the world but not of the world, to be that instrument that God has put within you as a great potential. You and God must work together to nurture and develop the beauty, the gifts and the abilities that lie within the soul. As you receive more of the Essence of God's Soul, so these capacities of the soul become evident and are empowered by Love.

I urge you to carry on in your efforts. When you are uncomfortable, these can often be the most powerful times for change, for shifting your consciousness, for understanding and realising the difference between how the soul is and operates as an instrument of God, as compared to the world of man and all the instruments man has created, or has evolved into that continue to contradict the Laws of God's Creation and Love. Yes, you are challenged. We do so every day of your life. Whether you are aware of this or not, the challenge is before you. It is something you must face head on, truthfully and with desire to truly learn, to change and to be that beautiful and bright instrument that you are meant to be.

May God's blessings be upon you, my beloved and beautiful instruments and students of truth. I am with you. I am Augustine, your teacher, always with you, always eager and willing to bring forth greater truth, greater insight, to help you along the way. God provides every ways and means for your development, your instrumentality and learning of the truth. Be open and eager, beloved students. May God bless you deeply. My love is with you. The love of the angels is with you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
