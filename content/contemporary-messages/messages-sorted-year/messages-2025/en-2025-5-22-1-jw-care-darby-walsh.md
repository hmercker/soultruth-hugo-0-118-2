# The Clarity of Soul Perceptions

May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

Thursday Night Judas Group, Nashville, TN, USA

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I Care.

I come to this circle with great joy. I don’t wish for you to be troubled, but I realize and can see some of you feel immense pressure from the challenges that the world brings to you. I wish to remind you that you have all come together as a result of your prayers, no matter how troubled, no matter how deep in despair or separated from God you felt, you cried out, you prayed, and God answered you. You continue to be protected in so many ways, seen and unseen, and as you continue to pray, and your faith overcomes your fears, and your doubts are replaced with the clarity of walking in faith in the grace of God in a life that has become a prayer, you begin to see what was behind a cloud, things that you had perceived with your souls beginning to appear with great clarity. In this state of being in the love of God, many things that were hidden become apparent and you can see as if from a tall building how all things are in a play with a divine ending, or shall I say, a never-ending.  For as your world has a beginning and an ending, God’s world is eternal.

You will only grow and progress every time you pray. It may not seem that you are making great leaps and bounds, but every forward motion in Divine Love produces blessings. So have faith, take heart, trust in your souls and in the great soul of God.

It is my joy to be with you, and I tell you my sister Claire is indeed your guardian, for you are all kind mice and all beloved by God. Walk in faith. Ask when you need help. Bless all, and you will make a difference. With all my love and blessings, I say to you we are all family and children of God, the heavenly Father who blesses us all with His love. I love you.

I am Care. Walk in love.
