# May You Develop Wisdom in Your Interactions With Your Brothers and Sisters

May 4<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Anna received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Anna. I come with my dear Mary, and I bring you my love and a gift of peace for each one of you. May it bring forward protection through the rest of this travel of yours. May you benefit from your experiences here and develop wisdom in your interactions with your brothers and sisters. May the Father bless you abundantly through each step of your journey.

We come with blessings for you because we love you. As we uphold you, we desire only the best for you. Our Father loves each one of us and is so very generous with his gifts. We are always aware when he dispenses them to each of us. We have the privilege, in some cases, to bring those gifts to you. For this, we are happy. We love you, dear children of God, deeply and truly. You are our family.

May God bless you. May you be watched over by each of your Celestial Angel guides. May you be open to their guidance every moment of your lives. God bless you, dear children. I am Anna and I love you.
