# The Impact of God's Grace and Humility

February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Orion received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Orion. I come once again to speak to you all, to help, to encourage, uplift, guide and teach. This is my role that I have accepted and gratefully so, to be with all of you as you pray together in this Circle of Light, this beautiful effort to uplift and to develop gifts and blessings that come as you receive a greater measure of the universal Love of God. It is given freely to you. It is given with the idea that you will apply and implement the knowledge that you might receive through these conversations that we have.

We cannot create the light for you. We cannot implement the truth for you. We cannot bring you to God with our will and desire that you do so. It is entirely your efforts and your commitment that bring about these blessings and awakenings. Indeed, all is available to those who are desirous of its blessings and benefits. All comes to you in prayer, contemplation and the unity that you experience together in these groups. Each one ventures out into the world with the desire to be a channel of love, a light in the world, to be an agent of change and to be God's instruments.

Indeed, as you continue in this way, you strengthen your relationship with God. As you strengthen your relationship with God, you strengthen this relationship that you carry together. We rise higher and higher with the light that builds within, with the desire to act in love, to be a channel of light and to be expressive of your soul's gifts, perceptions and capacity to love. All these things conspire to help develop and express our goals together, to be truly in alignment with this great Divine plan, to be released from those conditions that are contrary to this plan, to be true to our soulsâ€™ desires and to be true to God's Will.

These things are accomplished day by day, step by step, through the opportunities that God places before you so that you might learn and grow, be tested and choose. All of these things are of great benefit to you. If you were aware of all that goes into assisting you in your daily life, assisting you in the growing, blossoming of your soul, you would be amazed at the efforts being made on your behalf and for your benefit. There are many beautiful, beautiful souls who are dedicated to you and dedicated to your continued growth and development.

This does not just happen while you are in prayer together on these designated times. It happens with every breath, my friends. It happens because Love makes for the opportunities and possibilities of your continued development, growth, awakening and intensifying of light. Thus, you have all the resources that you require in order to grow. But, we cannot control your mind and desires, your priorities and your ambitions. These things are of you and your response to what is given.

Often, you feel as if you are powerful, gifted and blessed. Yet, many of these feelings and perceptions about yourself have more to do with the efforts made around you, the influences that come to you and the ideas that you create and absorb with these influences and blessings. Oh yes, you are all too human, my beloved friends. You think of yourselves as being powerful in light and, indeed, you are. But, the reasons why you are so powerful in light are not altogether to do with your capacity and light that builds within you. It is the result of what God is giving with every breath and what crowds around you in light, blessings, protection and love.

Humility is important, beloved souls, to be humble, gracious and grateful for what God gives to you. For God gives you everything. Be wise and gentle in your reception of these gifts and how you utilise what is given so that your steps are perfectly aligned with God's plan and Will for you that you may not stray off this Path of Love. That you may indeed walk it with dignity, grace, humility and honesty. That indeed you see that there is much, much more that needs to be developed and awakened and that you may yearn for this, beloved souls.

Do not pause and rest upon the laurels of your past glories and development, but walk forward in love, desire and anticipation of what is to come. For the path that you follow is eternal. The development that may come never ends. The possibilities of opening your gifts are without limitations. But, when you are in alignment with God's Will, when you have a deep desire for that great gift of Love, that fuel that brings about the beautiful blossoming of your gifts, then you are truly in alignment with God.

The human will, the human desires, those parts of you that are so entrenched in ideas and ambitions that seek to make you powerful, even though you may not see for yourself that these things live within you, they do nonetheless, because you are human. It is our desire that you tame these aspects of your humanness so that you may truly be in alignment with that which is Divine. When you are able to do this and able to look clearly and deeply within, to see your own motivations and desires, to recognise how the mind concocts and twists the true desires of the soul and makes them its own in ways that are not in harmony with love, when you see with the humility and grace that is of the soul, the wisdom shining through, the flowing forth unrestricted, then you will know and realise these beautiful aspects of your being, realised in their fullness and beauty. Then you will have true humility.

For as you see what God has created in you, that beautiful being brimming with potential and beauty, the feelings that you have toward God are love, appreciation and humility. This is grace. This is the true manifestation, the true expression of your purity and beauty. This is the expression of faith and the outpouring of light and love through you, from within you and all around you. This is what we desire of you. This is what God has placed within you, seeking that this be realised in all its purity and fullness. This is how you shall be formidable instruments for God. For within the plan of salvation of humanity, you will find yourself upon a road that you cannot truly understand or see. For as you walk this road, it takes great faith, great wisdom and strength to put one foot in front of the other, to accept and embrace what comes, to truly walk with the strength that brings greater blessings and allows God to guide you forward unimpeded.

My beloved and beautiful friends, you step upon the precipice of such a realisation. You are each being prepared with every breath to walk this road that is indeed very different from the ambitions and ideas of the mind. We wait, we pray, we stand alongside you and we anticipate that you will step forward in this formidable way, so that the expression of your gifts and true purpose, may be realised and accomplished in your earthly life. Be true to yourselves, my beloved friends, true to the soul that God has created and that God nourishes with His Love, true to all aspects of that soul as it emerges, being remade in Love and truly expressed.

May God bless you on this journey, knowing that we are close. Many, many beautiful souls gather to help you birth this beautiful soul, remade in Love. God bless you. I am Orion. My love for you is great. I am truly your friend, helper and guide. My love for you shall continue to be expressed. My gratitude for the opportunity to be with you is great. So, the journey continues. So, the growth and development of your soul is a day-by-day journey toward greater light. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
