# Teaching the Spirits

June 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

George Stokes & Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

**George:** I am with you now. I am George. I come to speak to the spirits who are in this circle.

You are being blessed. You are being uplifted. But you may be uplifted at all times, if you so choose. Your blessing this day is that you come to know that God loves you and is prepared to help you become brighter and more loving spirits and progress your souls through the Love that God has to share. As you pray, open your souls. Allow God to touch each of you and give to you what you need and what you truly desire.

Open, my brethren. Allow the Love to come to you and to find a home in your souls. Allow this Love to motivate you and move you in the direction that is highest and best, that will bring you the greatest fulfilment. We welcome you to come pray with us in every circle. In every moment, one of us, or many of us, pray together. You are part of this effort to help these souls upon the Earth progress. By progressing yourselves, you will be helping.

I thank you for listening. As God blesses you, open your souls and receive His gifts for each of you. I am George Stokes and I thank you for listening.

**Mary:** I am Mary. I come to comfort those of you who are in need of comfort. You will progress. It is the Law of God that each soul progresses. Do not give up. Continue to pray. Continue to seek out your heavenly Father. Continue in your progress. We always welcome you to ask for any of us to assist you. We are here for you because God desires that we be here for you.

God bless you, dear souls. May my love comfort you and hold you close in my heart.
