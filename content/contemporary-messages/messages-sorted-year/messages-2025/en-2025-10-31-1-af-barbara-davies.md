Barbara Davies received by Al Fike

God bless you, my friends. I am Barbara. How difficult it is for you, my beloved friends, in this earthly plane to be in alignment and in harmony with God's Laws of Love when all around you there is darkness, ignorance and strife, suffering in many ways. Yet, you persist. You continue to pray and long for this gift, because you know within the very depths of your being, your soul, that this is the right thing to do, the way toward salvation.

I know what a contrast it is for we who live in the Celestial Kingdom to come to you on this earthly plane. Even when you progress into the higher spheres, the contrast is stark. You will find great repose if you progress toward places of light. You will find great rewards for your efforts to pray and receive God's Love, for this is the way toward light. Indeed, all that suffering of the earthly plane will leave you when you make your way to the higher spheres. It is such a comfort to know that in every sphere, every dimension of God's creation, His Love permeates. His Love is present and available to each one of you. Even in the darkest of hells, God's Love is there, waiting for the soul to long for it. In the highest of Heavens, of course, this blessing is available. Our beloved brother, Jesus, longs for this as you do and grows within it as you do. Seek it out, my beloveds. Seek out that gift. Find your way along the path and your troubles and cares will not seem so great, as the redeeming qualities of God's Love continue to soothe the soul and calm the mind, bringing peace to your being.

So much awaits you, my beloved friends. So much is available to you, especially when you open that door, the door to the truth, the door to God's blessings of His Love. Then the floodgates of His loving ministrations pour upon you and uplift you into light. Be true to your soul's longings, beloved children of God. Know that we who inhabit the Celestial Kingdom still come to Earth. We do not abandon you. We are with you. We come to help and assist, to uplift, to give healing, to give peace, for we are God's instruments and God does not abandon any of His children, but seeks to redeem every soul, no matter their condition. God's efforts to help and to heal and to claim that soul in love and light is ever present and continues to work for the benefit of all.

You too can be God's agent of love, His beautiful instrument of light. If you so wish, then it is your gift and expression in the world to be that channel of love for God. It may come in many different ways, through many different means, but all of these ways and means are guided by God. That flow of love manifests through your unique gifts, personalities and presence in the world. May it flow profusely, powerfully and touch many souls. For many souls seek, but know not what they are seeking. So, you are there, my beloveds, to be that instrument, that source of truth, that beautiful light in the world. Be true to God's Will and all will fall and flow as His Will is realised in your life and in this world. We are here. Many are here. We assist you in your ministrations and in God's ministrations upon you. Be sure of your steps as you walk in faith, my beloveds. Be true to God's Will and all will come in the beautiful outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon you.

My love is with you. I am Barbara and I come to pray with you, as do many. For the grace of God is needed everywhere. Your soul longs for this and will be a harbinger of this expression in the world. God bless you, my beloveds. I love you dearly. I pray with you often. The light continues to grow bright and glow profusely in your lives and with those in your life. God bless you. My love is with you all. God bless you.
