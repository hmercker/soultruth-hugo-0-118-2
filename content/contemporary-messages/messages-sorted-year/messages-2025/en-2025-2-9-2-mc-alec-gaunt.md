May the blessing of God's Love pierce your souls, beloveds. I am Alec. As you receive the blessing of God's Love within your soul, you are well aware that, as we have often told you, it is undergoing a transformation into a Divine soul, the soul you were created to be, eventually becoming a Divine soul. You are changed, eternally changed.

Do you experience your soul transformation? Is there awareness of the changes, either small or great, that are happening within you? Do you notice the mark of the Divine upon you? It is an incremental transformation. If you do not already have some conscious awareness of your transformation, rest assured that, in time, you will experience soul consciousness â€” the reality of your soul.

Until this time, each day that you open yourself and allow the longings of your soul to reach for God, desiring to be blessed, touched and transformed in His Essence, this is how you grow to experience the transformation. As your soul is transforming, so too is the spirit or the energy of your soul. The expression of your soul is becoming stronger and will continue to gather strength as you receive more of the Divine Substance.

With the growing strength of your soul, you will also grow in your perceptions and your consciousness, where the expression and the spirit of your soul have the ability to filter through the spirit mind into your conscious awareness, all of these beautiful attributes of love, compassion, patience and all the wonderful expressions that come with a soul filled with God's Love. As you are transforming, it is helpful to take the time throughout your daily activities to wonder how the essence of your soul, through the Divine Love, would express and demonstrate this Love.

This, dear souls, is how you will become very familiar with the spirit of your soul and its expression. You must be curious about who you truly are, for within your soul, as you gather the Divine Love, you are gathering absolute Truth, absolute Love and absolute Harmony. These are the Divine qualities that you are becoming. When you learn to allow the expression of your Divine Essence that is within the soul, your experience in life is one of greater peace, joy and harmony. For in your conscious experience, you are feeling the spirit of love, the spirit of truth and the spirit of harmony, all of these attributes that come with the Divine Essence. You feel them. They are you. They emanate through your spirit body, and you sense them through your material body.

This vehicle, the physical matter that you call your body, is very familiar with experiencing and feeling the denser material qualities of your life. This part of you, as you continue on your journey of awakening, becomes more refined and sensitized to the finer essence, qualities and energies of your spirit body and your soul. One who walks a life on Earth has much to consider, because your attention is often in the realms of the material, as you go about your daily tasks, it is easy to overlook the finer qualities of yourself, your soul. When you are sincere in your awakening, desire to be in the world but not of the world, and you yearn to receive the Divine Love, you grow in your ability to perceive the finer substances of your life.

Continue on your journey, dear ones. Allow yourself to experience the substance of your soul. Allow the spirit of your soul to be known consciously, so that your life is informed through these Divine qualities, and you can experience peace when you are in worry or fear. When you know where to turn to, inwardly into the mind of your soul, and allow its wisdom to counteract worry, fear or doubt, you experience the energy of your soul. Divine Truth and Divine Love are in complete and absolute harmony for that moment.

So grow, dear ones, in your ability to turn yourself toward the truth that is within your soul. Hold yourself steady in this consciousness. As you do this, you can perceive your soul in a way that brings joy to you through your material mind, because you realize you know how to experience your true essence. Within your true essence, your soul, this is where you meet God, and this is where you are refuelled and drink deeply of the Living Waters.

At this moment in time, you are all undergoing a great transformation, and you can, for certain moments, be aware of your soul and experience your communion with God. This holds you steady and strong for some time, but unless you continue to refuel, the fire of God's Love cannot burn brightly and continuously. You need to refuel and have the fires of your soul stoked with God's Love, so that the breath of God can blow His Love upon your soul, making the embers bright and your soul burn with God's Love, truth, and harmony.

It is a journey that is full of wonder, and one that is also challenging as you move through the transformation. Each of you has experienced, through your challenges and the expiation of your human condition, that deep, abiding Love. Great peace, joy, understanding, wisdom and deeper faith are all for you. So, allow God to transform not only your soul, but your spirit, the energy of your soul and its expression. In time, you will know God's Will as clearly as we, your Celestial friends, know It.

I am Alec. I wish you a blessed journey, a journey of transformation that is the ultimate experience. God bless you.
