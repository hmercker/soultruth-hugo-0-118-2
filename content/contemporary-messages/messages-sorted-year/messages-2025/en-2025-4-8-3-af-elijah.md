# Revelations Pour Upon You!

April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Elijah received by Al Fike

The time of revelations comes, my friends. I am Elijah. These revelations are building. Indeed, the dam will burst and the revelations will flow. The insights will come readily, the flow of Love abundantly. For the time of great change is upon us all. You will be in alignment with that change, with those revelations and with the flow of truth and love.

This comes upon us quickly and will change the world, not a world that is acquiescent and apathetic, but a world that has been jarred to wakefulness, a world that will be confused and without its normal bearings and perceptions. This is where, beloved children of God, your instrumentality, your preparations and your efforts will come into play and help steady the world. For humanity to awaken, there needs to be something that will jar them awake. For humanity to be receptive, often it requires a crisis, something that will make them think and question. For humanity to be receptive, they must indeed feel within themselves a need, a deep need to help bring truth, truth that they are willing and open toward.

My beloved friends, each of you has the potential to be a prophet, to reveal to the world the truth. Each of you is being developed, strengthened, educated and awakened within your soul so that your capacities and abilities to teach, to heal and to bring love are enhanced and awakened by the great gift of God's Love. You will face a question, a decision, whether you are willing to step forward or not. There will be no confusion, no doubt, but there will be a great question. God does not force His children to act. God provides the opportunity, the situation, to allow action to take place. Within you, in your heart of hearts, within your soul, there is great wisdom. There is great perception and ability to step forward if you so choose.

The time of choice grows near. You have been receiving messages, warnings and invitations. Your souls have been called to serve. These messages are important and have  been conveyed for a reason. It is important that you understand that your angel friends and stellar friends, all who work with you, are well aware of the pending conditions and situations that will cause that dam to burst and will bring that great flow of love, blessings, peace and harmony to the world. Through you, much will be conveyed.

Yet, if you continue to hold back, doubt and focus your lives upon the material demands, then you will not be one to participate. You will become irrelevant in the flow and purpose of God's plan. God seeds many within this plan, for some will step forward and some will not. He does not rely on just one or two. He relies on many. When that time of choice comes, there will also be an opportunity to recognise and acknowledge your brothers and sisters who join you in this great unfolding plan. The divine revelation that will change the course of humankind toward light and toward truth, so you may all evolve into what you have been meant to become.

My beloved and beautiful children, I come to you in earnestness. I come to you acknowledging the great potential within. I come to you because I see strong and vital souls willing to take up the mantle, the banner of truth and step forward into the fray. As humanity is engulfed in chaos, disruptions and fear.

You are needed, my beloved and beautiful friends. Be true to the cause that has been presented to you. Be true to the longings of your soul and the feelings of your heart that urge you forward to bring comfort, truth and love to humanity. Do not shrink away in fear, fear of rejection and fear of judgement. These things will surely come, but they will not be the major reflection of human reaction toward you. Rather, many will come to you, cling to you and seek you out, knowing that what you have to offer, what you know, the wisdom that you carry, the truth that you carry, is vital for the survival of humanity.

You must acknowledge what has been given, the responsibility that comes with this gift and the strength that God has placed within you, with truth and love, with joy and compassion, with wisdom and grace. You are a light and you carry this light wherever you go. Be who you truly are, beloved souls. Respond to the calling that God gives you. Be true to that purpose, that fate, that God has placed within you. In this, you will know great rewards, great satisfaction and joy. Where there will be struggles, you will meet them with the strength and solidity that makes you impervious to these conditions. Where there is chaos, anger, frustration and fear, you will be the one who calms the troubled waters, the one who is God's instruments and channels of love. Where there is deep desire within your brothers and sisters to know themselves, to know the truth of their existence, to know the purpose of their being, you carry the pearls of wisdom and the treasures of truth within you. You will share your bounty with others without hesitation and without reluctance, but with a firmness and dedication that truly reflects your relationship with your Creator.

These blessings, elements and strengths within you will shine forth in the world and be brought to each soul you encounter, each situation that comes upon you, each tremor and shaking of the Earth, each storm that passes, each crisis that develops. You will be present as a channel of light, a purveyor of truth and a beautiful instrument of God. This is your destiny, my beloveds. It comes to you in its unique form for each individual. The path is laid out before you in its beauty and glory. We walk together. You in your faith, you in your desire to serve, you in the elements of truth that exist within you, in your consciousness, your capacity to love and to be a light will follow that road to its completion and be guided, protected and blessed every step of the way.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, truly, deeply blessed with the Father's Love. Continue to yearn for this gift and truly be in alignment with God's Will, and your part and place within God's great plan for the salvation of humanity will be crucial and be evident to you. You will walk without doubt and without confusion. You will have great faith and willingness to do so.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Elijah. I come to bring my revelation to you that soon the changes that we have spoken of for so long will be evident, powerful and will direct your actions and your efforts. For God is with you, as are we, beloved souls. God bless you. God bless you all.
