# Breaking Open the Tombs of God

May 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Nashville, TN, USA

Peter received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, Peter. I come in the grace of God, a disciple of the Master, and one who is considered the first leader of what became the Roman church. As you look around the world and see the edifices that have been created as places of worship and their beauty, one can feel the intentions of the builders to praise God and receive His blessings. And yet, in so many ways, these great structures have become like the tombs of God and truth. For, while they (Christian churches) often deal with issues of social justice and humanity, they are too often blinded by the stasis of dogma, frozen in time, and unwilling to change, believing that simply belonging is enough. Well, as you have been instructed, if you add praying for God’s love to any of these religions, to any group of spiritual aspirants, you will have broken open the tomb, and rather than the idea of a born leader, you may become a reborn-in-God’s-Love-leader.

We here see many of you planting the seeds of truth, opening the doors, so long closed of the hearts, touching the aspirations of the many. For when you offer a true prayer from your soul, other souls respond. It does not matter that the mind may reject what you know as truth. For minds discriminate between one thing and another, but when your prayer rises and touches the soul of those not only on earth, but here in spirit, you have done more good than any elected leader, anyone who is lost in the dogma and doctrines that hold so many back.

So, though you may not change the minds, you can touch the hearts, and you can bless, in prayer through the love of God, their souls. This is our great desire for your communion around the world to exponentially grow, not only in numbers, but in the great love of God. Of all the things on earth, there is nothing greater than this gift, which will transform you and heal you and truly be a blessing to the world.

We honor your courage, we honor your persistence, we honor the longings of your souls, and come and join you whenever you need us, whenever you ask.

There is one more thing to consider. If you wish to be a leader, if you wish to make a difference, if you wish to serve, it all begins with prayer. Once the love of God is implanted in your soul with a firm foundation, YOU will become the rock upon the real church, the foundation, and the leaders, because of the love in your souls, above the laws of men, and yet in harmony in the love of God.

With all my blessings, I shall step back and join you in your beautiful prayer, and I thank you for this time. I am Simon Peter, your brother and friend in the celestial heavens. With all my love and in the love of God, go in peace.
