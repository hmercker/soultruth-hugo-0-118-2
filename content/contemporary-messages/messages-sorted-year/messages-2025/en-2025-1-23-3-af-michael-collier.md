# Further Truths About Evolution

I have come to talk about evolution, which might surprise you. Leading off from what our dear Seretta Kem has said, I know there is a great debate in your world about the evolution of life on this planet. This planet was created as a result of elements and aspects which God created and set free into the universe, bringing about material, space, time, elements and all things that make up this universe of ours. In time, as these elements commingled together and gathered, the forces and energies helped to bring them together in a cohesive way.

Life began in a very rudimentary form upon this planet, requiring water, earth, warmth and air, all of these things. Life over many millions of years continued on in this way, as God tested and retested these aspects of life. When these things were well-formed in a satisfactory way, then God began to add other elements to life, making more sophisticated creatures. The process and evolution of this you know well. Some parts of this evolution were not satisfactory in terms of future endeavours that God had planned, so these things were removed and processes began again and moved forward.

But, none of these creatures that God created had a soul. They were life forms and, in their own beauty and way, God was well-pleased. They had a consciousness of sorts. Each and every element in this world has a consciousness. Some of the higher animals with brain functions have greater consciousness, but they do not live beyond the material plane. Rather, there is a consciousness of the species that exists upon the Earth plane. When the individual element of that consciousness goes back into the Spirit World, it is absorbed by that consciousness.

So, the individual identity of that being does not exist beyond material life, other than the fact that spirits, your brothers and sisters, may create these things. A beloved pet or some other creature may be created by the thoughts of developed souls. They do not have the same essence as they did on Earth. Still, they are alive and they add to the beauty and wonderment of life in the Spirit World.

When the world was at a state of readiness for humanity, God picked the life form that He knew would be most beneficial to comport a soul through life. So, in the image of this creature, which was added to by possessing a soul, then humanity, in its beautiful form, was created spontaneously, ready to live on the earthly plane. You refer to these individuals as the first parents but, in truth, there were more than one set of parents in more than one location, which surprises you, I am sure. Not that there were many, for there were not, but there were a number. For why would God create just one set? Why would God have just one go at having these creatures live and be successful?

What you have not understood, and this is new information, is that all of these first parents, as you would call them, were psychically connected together, so they knew of each other. At times, they came together. This made for an opportunistic situation for procreation. Collectively, humanity did not accept the offer, the gift of God's Love, for this was offered to each of these individuals and they rejected it. They continued on in the natural love path, as you call it, until our beautiful brother Jesus came into the Earth and reignited the possibility of receiving this gift.

You benefit from this greatly. For if Jesus did not come, or the equivalent of Jesus did not come, then you would all still be walking upon the natural love path and seeking and growing in this way. When our beloved Seretta Kem talks about the lower aspects of the brain, indeed, these aspects were developed many, many millions of years ago, refined and tested. They are owned by all creatures that may walk upon the Earth. Of course, not all creatures possess a brain, but many do and many recognise it. They are limited in their thinking and in their ability to act where you are not. With the gift of the soul came the gift of free will, the gift of decision, the gift of perception that is beyond the perceptions of animals and the gift of deduction, which is beyond the deduction abilities of animals.

So, you are highly gifted, beautiful souls. You are given many gifts and blessings. I will leave you with this to think about, to contemplate. I know that what I say about the first parents contradicts what has been said, but I believe you are all mature adults and can make your own choice and deduction about this information. It is true and these individuals existed many millions of years ago. Many do not wish to make themselves known to humanity. They see no point. The ones who have, have given you a gift describing their existence and their choices and so you are blessed by this.

The truth continues to unfold, my friends. The truth continues to unfold. God bless you. I am Michael Collier. My love is with you. I hope I have not disturbed anybody with my dissertation. I know it is controversial and I understand that this medium will bear the brunt of that, but so be it. He is strong. We are all for truth, are we not? God bless you. God bless you, my friends. My love is with you.
