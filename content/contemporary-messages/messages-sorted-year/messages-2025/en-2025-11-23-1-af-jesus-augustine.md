Jesus & Augustine received by Al Fike

**Jesus:** I come to be with you, my beloveds. Your brother and friend, Jesus, is here. I come to comfort you and to assure you as you walk the journey, the path of truth, seeking to grow your souls in the blessing of God's Divine Love, the touch of the Holy Spirit upon you, we are here. The Celestial Angels are with you. We form a united Circle of Light that is declaring to the world that the truth of the salvation of the soul exists and is palpable and powerful in the world.

It is for each individual soul to pray for this, to be open to it, to desire it and to receive it. As each individual soul struggles within the conditions that are of this Earth, there is a healing, an antidote to the pain and struggle that is of this Earth. Each of you are an example and a testimony to the power of this blessing, for each of you have felt the healing touch, the comfort, the upliftment, the power of God's Love upon you. You are the lights and the harbingers of truth. You are God's instruments upon the world to bring this truth, in all its simplicity and clarity, to those you meet, those you are guided to by God. All that you are in the world is a testimony to love and truth, the power of God's healing touch upon the soul.

Seek for the highest, my beloveds. There is nothing higher than this blessing. Yet, embodied in this blessing are many higher truths, experiences, healings and transformation. All is given within this one simple blessing of Love, this sacred Touch from God. Each of you are eager to receive and together, you are a formidable force of light and truth in the world. Do not keep this truth to yourself, but share. Share in the ways that God will guide you and inspire you. Share in your example, your efforts, your daily routines that will reflect the power of this love. Share in all that is within you. Within your soul are many gifts and blessings that may flow through you. Ignited by this Love, there are so many ways that God may use you, my beloveds. The world, so vast and full of souls, are in great need and require guidance and truth to show them the way toward the true salvation of their souls, the true awakening and transformation of their selves, their true selves on the journey of life.

We are united in this effort, my beloveds, and will continue to be united until the work is done. That, my beloved and beautiful souls, is a long way off. There is so much that God plans for humanity, to uplift, to heal and to bring harmony to your world and to all the worlds that exist in your world, the planes of spirit. Of course, there are many in the universe who are seeking truth. You, my beloveds, become a light, a beacon for those who seek.

My beloveds, we are all God's children. You are all my brothers and sisters. My desire is that you feel and know the intensity, the depth and breadth of my love for you, for it is great. Not as great as God's Love for you. With my presence in your life, you receive a taste, a sense of the power of God's Love. That Love is what we must all seek. I have not stopped seeking this gift. For 2000 years, I have sought to receive. Yet, I feel like I am just beginning. Thus, for you, my beloved brothers and sisters, the road less travelled only has a few footsteps upon it in the course of eternity. What wonders await you all, await all of us, as we continue on this road, as we seek at-onement with God.

The wonderment of God's creation is all around. Seek it out and receive in your perceptions of soul the true meaning, purpose and wonderment that is life. As you seek with the soul imbued with God's Love, you will find the wonders of God's Presence and creation and all that is within the universe of His creation. Seek this out, my beloveds. So much awaits you. You could not fathom what awaits, but with each day, there is a gift, a blessing, an opening and a further progression upon the path of truth and love.

My love is with you. Oh, how I love you. How I wish for each of you to be uplifted and to acknowledge the truth within your heart and soul, to seek out your Heavenly Father and to find the redemption, the life, the New Birth that is there for you. My beloveds, the blessings of God are upon you. Strain with your soul, reaching up to God, opening yourselves and receiving, as the desires of your soul are expressed in prayer and you are awakened in all the beauty and wonder that is God's touch of the Holy Spirit upon you.

God bless you, my beloveds. My love is with you. Oh, how I love you. Oh, how I care for each one of you. I have been with you in your prayers and I continue to carry you within my prayers, beloveds. Seekers of truth, harbingers of light, shall we continue upon this journey for eternity? God bless you. God bless you in His Love.

**Augustine:** There are great plans afoot, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. Yes, the beloved Master has brought a blessing to each one of you. This blessing is not only meant for you, but meant for what is to come, to prepare you, to empower you and to guide you upon the path of service. For God enlists each and every soul who is willing to bring the blessing of Truth of His Love to those who are seeking and are willing to receive it. This plan is far reaching and may engage each of you. If you so desire this, you will be guided. Prepare yourselves, beloved souls, for the time fast approaches that your service and your efforts and the flow of God's Touch and Will through you will guide you to many souls, will bring you into great light and your soul's purpose fulfilled.

God bless you, my beloveds, beautiful students of truth. I come in the stead of the Master, whose love for you is great. We, the Celestial Angels, continue to seek out the Will of God and to enact it in whatever way that we can. All is dependent upon your choices and your efforts. Be wise. Be informed with soul awareness of what you are meant to do and to enact your purpose in the world through the divine grace upon you. God bless you, my beloveds. I am your teacher, Augustine. I too love you, as do all the angels of heaven and the beautiful bright spirits and your brothers and sisters on Earth. God bless you in His Love.
