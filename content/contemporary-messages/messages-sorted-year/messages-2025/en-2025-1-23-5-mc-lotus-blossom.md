# Describes the Benefits of Breathing

Barbados Retreat, St Michael, Barbados

Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

I am Lotus Blossom. You have been told that we have been working with you on the nervous system, helping your physical bodies to release any constrictions that you may carry, where there is stagnation in your physical body, your aches and your pains. While we can do many things for you during this time of development and while you are together, we play our part in helping you to make a shift within the spirit body and the physical body.

How is it that you can maintain the openings that we have helped to establish within each one of you? It is not that we are advocating for any particular method, practice, or way of moving the energies within your physical body. Yet, there is a truth to being able to have a practice, a regular practice of sorts, that allows the energies to be free of stagnation and move.

In some lineages, this is called life force, this is called chi, and this is called prana. All of these things are directly impacted by your breath. It is one thing to breathe and have your body function, to keep your soul, as you would say, within your physical body. Without the breath, you are no longer here. As you transition into spirit, you take one last exhale, and when you are born into this material world, you come in on an inhale.

So, dear friends, I want you to consider the life force that can come in with your breath, with a deep, long, slow inhale and exhale. As you do this, you are tapping into the inner channels that sit within the spirit body, where your life force, the chi and prana can flow more freely. As these channels are opened, what you will come to recognise is how directly related they are to your mental thinking. As your mind begins to release the old patterns and constrictions, you have the ability to move these energies through your body more easily and readily.

Anyone who is familiar with the practice of the breath, as this dear instrument is, is familiar with the workings that occur within the spirit body. As this happens, this opening, the freeing occurs, and there can come an awareness of certain patterns held within the subconscious. As you move through your expiations, this is a beautiful partnership, a wonderful tool to allow yourself to progress in subtle ways. These awarenesses merge beautifully with a prayer for Divine Love. For not only is your path about awakening the soul, but it is also about becoming aware of who you are as a conscious being and what holds you back.

The same is true with your physical body. Any graceful practice that you can participate in, provided your physical body is able to do so, is highly recommended. You will feel freer in your body and more open. When you do not have to be with your attention upon the pains within the physical body, this frees your mind, able to be more with God, as you may say, more upon your spiritual path, rising higher than the material elements that you experience and carry in your soul here while on Earth.

So, dear friends, not only do we wish for you to attend to your soul, but we also wish you to attend to your physical body and its care, as well as to your mind. These things, when put together, tend to affect all parts of you. It is not only that we support you in your soul development. We want to assist you in your physical experience while you are here on Earth. Those emotions that you carry, those traumas, the hurts and the wounds, they all sit within your physical body. Any practice that you can engage in that allows them to be free to move through you is definitely supported.

So, consider these things. You are a spiritual being, but you are here in this beautiful body with a wonderful mind. To honour all parts of you is a glorious thing, because it is God who has created everything that you are. How you care for and tend to the gifts of your body, mind, and soul is your responsibility.

We carry you in love. We attend to you, and we thank you for taking the time and care of your physical body. When you need to rest, please do so. I am Lotus Blossom. It is my pleasure to help to guide you and assist you in tending to all parts of who you are here and now. God bless you.
