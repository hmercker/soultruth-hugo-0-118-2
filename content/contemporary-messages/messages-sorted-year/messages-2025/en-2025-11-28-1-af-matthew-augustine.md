November 28<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Matthew & Augustine received by Al Fike

**Matthew:** God bless you, my beloved and beautiful friends. I am Matthew. You are the intrepid seekers of truth. Each one of you has spent your lives seeking to be in harmony with who you truly are and what you are created to be. Because of your intrepid and brave efforts, desires and actions, God has blessed you mightily. God continues to bless you along this road that is certainly less travelled.

Many believe they have the truth. Many are firm with that belief to the point of rigidity. Yet, you have woven through your life seeking, seeking to know yourself and seeking to be in alignment with creation. You have found a truth like none other. You have found the power of God's Love that will transform and heal. You continue to walk this road seeking greater truth, higher blessings to receive and to garner the most that you can in your life to help nourish you and propel you upon the journey of life, which you all are well aware does not stop with the fleshy body, but continues as you walk this road, which will be a road to eternity.

As you walk this road, I encourage you to be an example of this truth that others may see its blessings and benefits manifest through you. I urge you to speak the truth when you can and to be that light that God wishes you to be. When you are in alignment with God, when you seek to serve God, when your soul is open to God's Love and receive it in abundance, then you not only walk a road that shall benefit yourself but will walk a road that God will guide many to you. You will have that soulful influence upon your brothers and sisters.

Back in my day, we taught the truth. We sought to be God's instruments, Jesus's disciples. We travelled the world in our efforts to reach out to many. Many responded and were touched by our instrumentality, the channel that we were for God. So it must be for you, my beloved friends, to reach out to the many, many souls in the world who are lost and who are seeking. As they seek, God will guide them to you and you to them. You will find ways and means of communicating, of expressing your light, the Truth that is your being resplendent in God's Love. Their souls will feel this, even when their minds may reject it. Their souls are drawn and this may cause a stirring within that individual. If you both speak the simple truth to encourage others to pray, to open themselves to receive the great gift of God's Love, then you have given them the greatest gift of all, the gift of truth. Though they may reject this within their minds, within their souls they have received it. In time, that seed that you have planted may indeed sprout and grow a mighty tree, an expression, a soul that is redeemed in the Father's Love.

My beloved friends, for all of you, this is your journey. This is your purpose. This is your destiny, to be an example, a teacher, a channel of truth, love and light for the world. Do not ignore this. Do not shirk from your responsibility, but step forward boldly and give in love. For when you give in love, when you express love to your brothers and sisters, they will feel it and respond. Many will wonder why you are such a light where love flows freely. They will be curious. They will be drawn. They will feel a sense of relief, of acceptance, of love. As you continue to be that channel of light and you establish a relationship with them, you will have many opportunities to show the way and to express the truth.

God works through many instruments. God works through the individuals who are seeking, guiding them forward. Have faith in what may be possible in a day. For each day brings renewed possibilities, renewed opportunities. Be open and receptive to your guidance, beloved souls, and be a light in the world. For the world desperately needs light and love and the world may be changed by this one simple truth that you have to give, to share, to express in the world.

May you be blessed upon that journey, my beloved friends. I am Matthew. My love is great for each of you, and indeed we follow your travels, your daily expressions. We are with you, and we seek to serve as you do. Together, we make a formidable force for good as God guides us all in the Love of His truth, the Light of His Love. God bless you, beloveds. Matthew loves you. God bless you.

**Augustine:** God will put the words in your mouth, my beloved and beautiful students. I am your teacher, Augustine. As Matthew encourages you to step forward, I encourage you to have faith that in stepping forward, God will utilise you and express truth through you in all the beautiful ways that will touch another soul. All you need do is step forward in faith and walk in the Light and Truth of God's Love to receive evermore of this gift.

You, my beloved students, will be teachers and healers and lights in the world, God's instruments. Each of you continue to seek out ways and means of expressing these things. With each day comes the opportunity to test the ground, to be a channel of light, love and truth. God will provide the opportunities to do so, provided you are willing and you are receptive to His guidance. Say a prayer that asks God to guide you, that you may be an instrument of His Light, Love and Truth. He will surely open the doors. The opportunities will be presented to you and the blessings will flow.

God bless you, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I continue to heed God's Will and to seek to serve God. I do so with you, with others and with many spirits. God bless you, beloved students. Augustine loves you.
