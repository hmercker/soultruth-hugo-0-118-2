# Jesus Was Not Meant to Die at an Early Age

April 18<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

May the Fatherâ€™s Love continue to inflow into your souls, each of you. Open yourselves wide and express the desire to receive this Love with every breath and every thought as you gather today in prayer.

Yes, it is the most unfortunate circumstance that our beloved brother Jesus met an early death in his life. This was never intended by God. For God does not intend for any life to be short. Yet, indeed, because of the human condition and choices made by humanity, these things happen in your world. Often, the minds of men rationalise this to be the Will of God, but I assure you, it is not. Every soul upon this world is meant to live a rich, full and long life. Indeed, many do. The idea that the good die young and the wicked die of old age is completely erroneous. Indeed, there are wicked souls who die young and beautiful, bright souls who die at old age. Because of circumstance and conditions, many reap the whirlwind of their actions and the whirlwind of collective actions in the world. Their fate is often determined not by God, but by man or their own choices, which lead to the decline of the body and, at times, an early death.

Beloved souls, because you continue to pray for the gift of Father's Love, you will be strengthened in body, mind and soul. You will live to a good age, provided you follow the Laws of Creation and you exemplify the Laws of Love. Life is a gift. It is given so you might have identity as the soul incarnates into the flesh. It is given so that you may grow, develop personality and have experiences which bring love and possibilities of the flesh, incarnate and expressed in a material world, and to choose, to choose light, to choose love, to choose harmony, to choose grace and to choose all good things that will indeed sustain you, not only in this life, but in the next, in the world of spirit.

You make your travels along life's path, make your choices and express yourself in whatever ways you find possible. In this, there can be great fulfilment and great expression. You may find love in your relationships with others, with your children, with the world, or you may not, if you deem yourself to walk a path that is not loving and not open to love. Yet, the highest aspirations of man are that of love, whether it be the expression of their innate love, their natural love, or coming to know the Divine Love of God.

This higher Love is the greatest gift that can be given. This beautiful gift of Love, the Essence of God's Soul, will indeed transform, uplift, will heal and bring joy. God is consistent in His blessings of Love. All that is required is your sincere desire to receive it, to ask and to open yourself to this gift. God is always there for you. Yes, we are there as well. Our beloved brother Jesus is there to help uphold you and uplift you. His ministry has not changed. For the hundreds of years that he has been in spirit, has entered into the Celestial Kingdom, he and all of us who share this Kingdom together are earnest in our efforts to assist you and help you to find your way to at-onement with God, to know that higher Love and all its benefits and effects upon you.

You are truly God's children, those of you who have chosen the higher road, those of you who choose to live a good life and to express love in every part of your life, every part of your being. In this, the goodness grows within you and all around you, the light brightens and your capacity to love deepens. Jesus came to show the way to this Love. We follow our beloved Master as he continues to lead the way, not only for you, but for us as well. How blessed we all are to have in this world such a beloved soul, such a light-filled, wisdom-filled, love-filled individual as our beloved brother Jesus. How graced we are in this relationship with him. You must know that he always points the way to God and that you must follow his lead, his intention, which is to inspire you toward this at-onement, this grace that comes to the soul.

May you truly be blessed by this, beloveds. Beautiful students of truth, you have found the highest and may you walk the road of love toward at-onement with God. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am with you on that road, as are many angels. The beloved Master is with you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you all.
