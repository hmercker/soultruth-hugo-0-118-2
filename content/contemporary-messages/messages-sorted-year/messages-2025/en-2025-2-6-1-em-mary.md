I am Mary, the mother of Jesus. I bring you blessings, blessings of peace, contentment, upliftment, blessings of truth for your souls. For your souls are in development as a baby is in development. As your souls continue in your individual progressions, you will find many gifts and many truths that lie within them, put there upon your incarnation.

Dive deep, brothers and sisters. Dive deep into your souls and seek the truths that are within you already. There is great purpose in your doing so.  It will help you along your paths. It will guide you to the Father and uplift you in your moment to moment living upon this Earth.

These are blessings that the Father has bestowed within each one of you, but you must seek them. You must go deep within yourselves. Make the effort to go deep. We join together. We in the Celestial Heavens, in a circle around you, supporting you, uplifting you, that you may face the Father with your souls wide open and enjoy those gifts that He now bestows upon you. You are special children to the Father, His true children, and He blesses you accordingly. We will keep you uplifted while you commune with God.

My love is with you. I am Mary, the mother. I bless you with my love.
