John the Babtist received by Elizabeth Mack

I come with a blessing from our Father, blessing for each and every soul here. His Love pours down upon you at this time. Open widely, for His Love for you is great. Open, dear children, and be thankful, for your world is changing and your love will help it to change for a new generation of souls.

You are so blessed in this endeavour. Walk tall, children of God. Walk brightly and love your way upon this Earth.

I am John. My love is with you, as is the love of many who are here and the Fatherâ€™s, to a greater extent than you have previously experienced. May you be open to His blessings and may your lights shine brighter than before.
