# Laying down your love

February 17<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Nashville, TN, USA

Jesus received by Jimbeau Walsh

Beloved brothers and sisters, it is written that *"there is no greater love than one laying down their life for the sake of their friends."* What does this mean? It is often attributed to my death and the sacrifices of my disciples, and in that context, it is true. However, I might have just as easily said there is no greater gift than one who lays down his love for his friends, and in the love of God. So, your mortal sacrifice is not required to be a gift to others, and truly, the great gift is the Father’s love for all His children.

I did not come to be a human sacrifice, the blood of the lamb, present myself as part of the godhead, or my blood redeeming the errors and sins of humankind. No, I came to fulfill the law, the Law of Love, and to bring the truth of God’s love, and in this sense, I am the savior, wishing to lift all souls in the great gift of God’s love, pointing the way.

As many know, my words have been lost, interpolated, and misunderstood. But one can read between the lines and discover the great truths. You, who are the Second Coming, have been blessed with the truths through James Padgett, Robert Lees, Reverend Owen, Albert Fike, sister Maureen,  Eileen Caddy, and my brother here, amongst others. For I have spoken through many and attempted to get through and correct the errors for centuries. And finally, it is here and available, and you, my beloved brothers and sisters, you are the outward sign of truth, of grace, carrying the light and love in your souls as you give your gift, you give your life, in the love, to all.

Perfection is not required. Intellectual understanding is not required. For as I have said many times, my truths are simple, and the way is in prayer. It is the way of the heart. The heart opening to God and God responding, opening each soul and filling it with the blessing of His love. May it be yours.

With all my blessings and in the love of the Father and all here, I shall join you now in this peace, in this love, and embrace each one. For, I love you all and always shall. May God bless us. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. Go in peace. Go in peace.
