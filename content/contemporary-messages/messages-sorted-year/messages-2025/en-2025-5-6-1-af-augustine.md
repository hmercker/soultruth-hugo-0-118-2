# The Depth and Breadth of God’s Love for You

May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. It is understandable that in your world there is a resistance to prayer and to God and to religion as you see it, because humanity has perverted truth, has taken the Love from God and turned it into judgement, has taken the simple Truth that our beloved Jesus taught and turned it into ritual and complicated edicts that constrict and restrict people from being themselves, their true selves. When God is made to be judgemental and people reflect this, then there is no avenue for an innocent soul to come to God without the edicts and restrictions that humanity has placed upon the world.

You are the ones who will show the way. Each of you, as different as you are, each of you from different backgrounds and lives, have come together in harmony and said, “I love you. I honour you. I love God and I honour God.” Within that love and honouring, there is no judgement, there is no fear and there is no restriction. There is only love unconditional that you aspire to express and God does express to each one of you. The depth and breadth of God's Love for you is unimaginable. You are not capable of seeing the greatness of God's Love for you, each one worthy, each one created in the image of God.

You seek the Substance that will bring you closer to your Creator. You are blessed with the Divine Love into your soul, infilling it and transforming it so that you may be that being that is truly a reflection of God's Love for you, a reflection of God in the ways that you are capable in the soul that you have. You must teach this, demonstrate this and be this in everything that you are and everything that you do. The closer you come to this one edict of loving and expressing love in the world, then the happier you will be, the more fulfilled you will become and the brighter light you will express in this world.

It is often the case that you put judgement upon yourself. You see your limitations. You see how you are unable to be that unconditionally loving individual. Yet, every day that you pray, every moment in your life that you breathe, you are eliciting the blessings of God. This is the key that shall bring about this transformation of self, this consciousness of being that is a true expression of God's Love. Do not assess yourself with the severity of a mind that seeks perfection. Assess yourself with a soul that longs to love, that longs to accept and to be whole within, so that you may know the joys, the perceptions, the experiences and the gifts that lie within your soul.

You are young, young souls seeking to grow, expand and be in life and truth, to express love and joy. As you continue on this road, have deep compassion for yourselves, deep compassion for one another and for the world. God has gifted you with the most powerful Truth in the universe and with this gift, with this knowledge, you will become leaders. You will become the expression of the true purpose of a soul, which is to find at-onement with its Creator and which is to become that light that will last for eternity. Each of you is on that road. Each of you takes a step closer with each prayer and each intention to be in the light and to express truth, to be close to God. I honour you.

I honour you, my daughter, in your efforts on this day of recognition ( birthday). The angels of Heaven recognise the light that you are and the beautiful soul that you are. Allow yourself to absorb and to acknowledge the truth of your existence, of your creation, unique in the world and the universe and beautiful in all its ways and expressions. God bless you, my daughter. May God keep you in the Light always and may you come to learn and know the Truth in greater depth as you progress in the Love of God. God bless you.

For all of you, my beautiful students, I acknowledge your efforts, your desire to be in the Truth of God's Love, in the way of God's Love, in the expression and acknowledgement of God's Love for you and God's Love existing within you. We shall be a formidable force together to bring this Truth forward. Each of you continues to grow, expand and develop in the ways of the soul. In time, you will be that teacher of the ways of the soul. You will be that healer. You will be that comforter, just as our beloved brother Jesus did in the world, so you may do also, beloved souls. You may do also and bring great healing and comfort to many and teach them the way to at-onement with God.

My beloveds, my beautiful students, I love you. I acknowledge you. I am your teacher, Augustine. May God bless you deeply, beloveds. God bless you.
