Andrew received by Elizabeth Mack

Bless you, children. Bless you with the Love of God entering your souls and all that that entails. I am Andrew. I speak to you from the Celestial Heavens where Love abounds. Love cannot be described, other than to say this Divine Love that has transformed our souls is endless, is ever growing, is all encompassing and contains all the truths of our Father's universe.

It is the great Truth of existence. As you reach for it, as you seek it, long for it and desire it, it encompasses your soul and burns a very bright light and a very great depth. As you allow it to be expressed in your daily lives, it touches the souls of many, many other souls, those seen and those unseen. This is the great so-called miracle that God has provided to bring about the transformation of one soul, that you become truly at one with God in this Love. You share through your expression of it with all who surround you.

How I wish you could comprehend the infinite power of this Love to awaken and to transform, one by one, each soul upon the Earth. This is a great honour that God bestows upon each of you who prays for this Love. I ask that you take in deeply this Truth and contemplate upon all that has been said regarding this gift, which is also a great responsibility and a great privilege. Reach out, dear souls, to your brothers and sisters and help them also understand the immensity, the absolute power of this Love in all its dimensions. Open your souls to receive this gift and accept the responsibility of sharing all that has been given to you with all whom you come to collaborate with. For it is a collaboration once you express it. You are forever connected to these souls with whom you pray, those you teach and who you love.

I thank you for listening. I am your brother, Andrew. My love touches each of your souls and your love touches mine. God bless you in every way that moves you forward in your progression. God bless you, true children of God.
