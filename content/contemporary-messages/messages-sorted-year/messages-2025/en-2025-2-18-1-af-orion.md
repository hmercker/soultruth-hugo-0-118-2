# Your Path Narrows in Simplicity and Joy!

The path narrows for you all, my friends. I am Orion. The intensity of your development and your focus continues to narrow with it as you continue to find your way upon the path of service. As you continue to put aside all those things that are obstructions, the clarity comes, the understanding comes and the dedication deepens. As you come to know the extent that God loves you and that God's Love is pouring within you, these things of life that are not of God fall away and greater detachment, wisdom, and focus come in their stead.

My beloved friends, as we continue on our journeys, you will find that that which has been difficult will no longer be so, that that which distracts you no longer does and that that which is complicated and part of your mindful reckonings and creation will become clear and simple. In this, there will be joy. In this, will come greater wisdom and strength. In this, there is no confusion. There is no wandering, inasmuch as you consider with your mind the various aspects and the various twists and turns that God is leading you upon. Rather, you will come to feel and recognise that you are on the right road, that indeed, what secures you is faith and a trust in God's plan and reckonings for you.

It is a simplified, straighter path, something that brings comfort and peace, something that brings strength, recognition and perception, that helps you to understand what God intends for you and who you truly are within God's creation and God's plan. It does not require great learning or study. It requires prayer and application of the truths that you know. In the simplicity of all of this, the mind is in wonderment, even consternation, for the mind thrives on details, thoughts and words that add to the complexities of your reality and your experience of life.

As you grow in soul, learn the language of soul and learn the ways of the soul, the mind becomes less important and less powerful. It finds its way and its standing within your consciousness. As the soul grows and the understanding of soul expands and the perceptions are clear and more focused, then the ways and means of the mind and its desire for dominance become somewhat irrelevant. Not that the mind will always be the enemy or the challenge, but the mind, in time, will be absorbed by the mind of the soul. That all three minds that exist within you, the separation that was never meant to be, will be absorbed into one.

When that occurs, then there will be no doubt, there will be no confusion, there will be no misunderstanding and there will be no reluctance. There will only be the joy of the expression of the soul, freed from this tyranny of mind and this separation of spirit. All will be one. This is your goal, beloved souls. Though it may not be reached in this material plane, you come ever closer. As you come closer, the integration comes with it. You are finding your way. You are seeing the way forward and we are happy and joyed with your progress.

Continue, my friends, continue. You know that we are with you. God blesses you with every day. You are becoming an ever-brighter light. Indeed, the path narrows, the focus intensifies and the knowledge and awareness come in ways that you have not expected or understood. Yet, it comes nonetheless, because God is feeding your soul in His Love, knowledge and Truth. You are growing, expanding in Love.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion and I love you all, beloved souls. I love you all.
