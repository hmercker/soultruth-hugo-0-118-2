# God’s Love restores one’s Sense of Humor

Charlie Chaplin received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear, sweet, charming, wonderful, lovely friends. It is I, Charlie.

I have been away for a while doing the work with much joy. I now live very close to the celestial heavens, and I was moved to join you today, a day where some peace has been restored and much gratitude and thanksgiving abounds. It has been said that God’s love restores one’s sense of humor, and this is very true. For the Greeks had what they called a type of humor that was medicine and they believed that the bodily fluids controlled one’s wellbeing and health and when this was restored it was considered that one’s sense of humor had come back, able to see things without the burden of the world, hence the phrase “lighten up” and I could even use the words “delight”.

Of course, one doesn’t necessarily have to have the love of God to have a sense of humor, but it sure helps, and there are many types, many ways that humor can be implemented in daily life. For one who is despondent, a humorous anecdote can lift their spirits. In social situations that are uncomfortable, humor can relax and calm people and give them a sense of belonging. When you touch one’s funny bone, there’s a physical reaction, and the vibration of humor is healing. It is fair to say that those who have suffered greatly, those who often live in extreme poverty, war zones, places of physical devastation, etc., those souls who you would least expect to have a sense of joy, often can find a nugget of humor, a way to be lifted from the weight of the world. You see this in many cultures; you see this in people who have been oppressed.

I myself had a rather difficult, if not tragic, childhood and I could even say I was desperate for humor but beyond that, as I have said before, I could see the value, the great value, of bringing humor to the world, sometimes in a ridiculous manner, for life can be ridiculous, sometimes in a way of showing the evils of the world, the injustice, the in-harmonies and spoofing them. For, in the long run, love always prevailed and in your time on earth, as you pray, as you come into the presence of God, you bring a light-heartedness and a glow from your souls into the world, and though you may never have a chance to speak to everyone about the love of God, about the transformation of souls, about the necessity of prayer, as you engage in actualizing your prayer, your relationship with God, being open to guidance, allowing the flow of grace that lifts you up, you will see that your humor can be put into any situation in a loving manner, rather than a harmful way. Yes, there is that type of humor, but far better to teach with a sense of joy and fun and light-heartedness than to be mocking or cruel, for these things do not lift the spirit. In the midst of your world and all its shortcomings, all the nefarious goings-on, you can bring in the light of love, hope. You can show the world that there is something beyond its weight, something in ascendancy over its darkness. As you go from concern to caring, from being disconnected to empathetic and caring, shine your light on this world. Do the dance of love and the song of life in the midst of the fogs that sometimes surround you. You will clear the atmosphere. I know this from my own experience.

Trust in God. Trust in your soul and be of good cheer. I thank my brother for allowing me this time today, and I hope you all have a good laugh at my expense. I am your brother in Christ, a redeemed soul, and your friend in love and laughter. I am Charles, Charles Chaplin. Charlie to you. God bless you.
