Jesus received by Al Fike

I come to be with you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you this day. We come to gather the light from all over this world of yours, that an angel may be with each one of you, a blessing from God upon you as your soul continues to awaken to the Truth of the Father's Love, that Truth living within you, awakening your soul in the great blessing that is His gift to you and to all of humanity.

Each one who desires this gift shall receive it. Each one who has the yearning of the soul and comes faithfully to their Creator to receive, to know God’s Love, the extent, the depth and breadth of it, the wonderment of it, the miracle of it, may be given this gift. You must open your souls, my beloveds, wide, wide, to receive a great inflowing of the Divine Essence so that you may count yourself one who is on the path toward at-onement with God and, in time, a candidate to enter into the Celestial Heavens.

Each of you is worthy. Every soul is worthy of this gift, provided they yearn for it and ask for it. You have learned how you might receive. I beseech you to practise this prayer and desire often so that you may progress swiftly and avoid many of the pitfalls and challenges of the lower planes of spirit and of the earthly plane. When your time comes to pass into the spirit world, and it will come to each one of you, for each individual must pass into this world, releasing the cloak of the flesh and gaining the garb of the spirit, you will find that as you progress here on Earth you do yourself a great service. You will have many benefits that come with your efforts to be a light, to purify conditions that are not of light and to learn the power of Love, its transformational touch upon your soul, how you may be that channel of love, an instrument of light in the world.

This too brings you great benefit and gains as you travel in the world and travel toward the spirit world. There is much that God will give to each one of you, provided you are dedicated, provided you have faith and walk in the light that is in harmony, that reflects the harmony of God’s Laws of Love and creation. Each of you has a journey to take, unique and beautiful. You will be guided, for God provides His angel friends, gatekeepers, protectors and guides along the way. This is given freely. This uplifts, protects and feeds you with truth. God’s compassion and love for each one of you is beyond your capacity to truly know. Yet, you have a glimpse. You feel the Touch. You are aware that something beyond you, something that is powerful and beautiful, is touching you with Love, grace and peace.

This is God giving to you what your souls require. The journey, the spiritual journey of life, is provided for every soul who desires this. Be true to your soul’s desires, my beloveds. Be true to that which will bring you light, harmony and peace, that which is of love and you will have an extraordinary life, a life filled with blessings, a life that provides for you what you require to navigate this world of yours in light and harmony. All is given freely, beloveds. It is for you to seek, to find, to receive and to build faith within that says, *“I am a child of God and God is close. I know God. I am with God, and I shall be with God evermore.”* This is your destiny, beloved souls. This is the blessing that comes to the child, innocent and repentant, with a deep desire to be in alignment and close to their Creator. In the closeness comes the blessing. In the faith comes more blessings and with more blessings comes greater faith.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am with you always in my prayers and desires that you continue on this path and are bold in your desires and efforts to be with God and continue to awaken to the truth, the truth of the soul that is the eternal truth, the truth that will remain with you forever and will grow in accordance to your desires and prayers and faith, His Love the cornerstone of your life. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. Know this. Do not doubt. I am with each of you, and I love you, for you are each my brother and sister, each my beautiful friends and part of my family. We gather in the light of truth and shall be blessed accordingly with our desire, our openness, as we reveal our most tender place of soul to You, dear God. We are blessed. Open yourselves, my beloveds. God’s Holy Spirit is with us all and shall bless us deeply. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you. Oh, how I love you, my beloveds. God bless you.
