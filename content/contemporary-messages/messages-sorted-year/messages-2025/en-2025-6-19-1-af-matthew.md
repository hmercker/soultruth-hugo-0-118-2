# Consider With Patience and Flexibility the Different Levels of Guidance in Planning Efforts

June 19<sup>th</sup>, 2025

DLSF Board Meeting, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Matthew received by Al Fike

My friends, it is Matthew. I wish to speak about the nature of guidance. Indeed, the most concrete and lowest level, shall we say, of guidance comes when you meet together, make your plans and consider different aspects, costs, etc., of your plans. This is something you need to do as a group, since you live upon the earth plane. There are other levels of guidance that come as you pray and consider your actions and your motivations. When you are inspired to act, often that feeling comes from the soul, primarily. It trickles and filters down into the brain and the mind, until you have something that is concrete enough to apply to your planning.

Indeed, the level of guidance that comes from God to your soul is the most important, but it can also be vague and undefined. You must be patient with how God feeds you with guidance, how we are with you and help you with your guidance. You must consider that there is a process that takes time. As you winnow out the mindful biases and interpretations in an attempt to come to clarity, then this too takes time. As you communicate together, as you pray together, so the power of your collective prayers helps to bring clarity as well.

You will not know the exact details for every aspect of guidance that you receive at any given moment, but with faith and a desire to be God's instruments, you will find that the details will come in time and in harmony with the flow of your efforts. It is human to desire to have all things written in detail, almost like a contract with God. Yet, indeed, as each individual changes and is transformed in Divine Love, then the approach and the expression of guidance through that individual may change accordingly. Thus, God's plan and God's guidance will change accordingly. The conditions in the world will affect God's plan and guidance. Your own condition will affect that. Your collective approach and condition will also affect these plans. You must be flexible, open and willing to be in harmony with what is intended. That intention, the divine intention, may shift and change in accordance to conditions on Earth and conditions within you.

I know this does not reassure you in terms of the efforts you are making and planning, but I wish to remind you that God's Will is flexible. It is like water finding the right course, the course that is in harmony with the conditions on this Earth of yours. Allow yourself to be attuned to God's Will in this way, to be open and to allow previous structured and in-place plans to be nullified and to begin again when conditions change, when circumstances change and when individuals change.

If you are in spirit and in the higher planes of spirit, there would not be these difficulties or these disruptions. Yet, in your earthly plane, there are always difficulties, obstructions and conditions that interfere. Thus, the circuitous route is usually the route taken. It is important for you to understand and be patient with this process. For the Will of God will be implemented, but the route through which that implementation takes place can be circuitous. At times, it can be quite frustrating. Indeed, what you think you have as a commitment and a plan may indeed be disrupted by outside forces and conditions on the earthly plane.

This instrument has experienced such things and has been thinking about this today. I have been with him in his thoughts. I understand his reticence when it comes to making commitments of a deep and important nature, such as Direct Voice. Yet, you must forge ahead, my friends. You must make your plans with the proviso that plans can change. You must be strong, forthright in your commitments, also eager to receive guidance and to change those plans accordingly. In your world, nothing is set in stone. Everything is pliable, flexible, malleable and is under the influence of many individuals, spirits and earthly conditions. How can you make set plans when these things are active and influencing everything that you do?

Walk in faith, my friends. Walk with courage, the courage of your convictions, the courage of your desire to serve God and to serve humanity. Walk in love. When you find someone who obstructs and makes your life difficult, do not judge them, but love them. Walk in peace, the peace that passes all understanding. For when things go awry, you have the foundation of peace to carry you through. Most of all, be a channel of love in the world. That love is malleable and can be applied to every circumstance and condition. When you understand this and truly live this, then the plans of yesterday that are not the plans of today are acceptable and you are at peace with them.

It is the way of your world, my friends. It is not the way of God, but it is what you must deal with in your daily life. Indeed, sometimes wonderful surprises come and, other times, great disappointments. Yet, you are deliberately and with great desire willing to be God's instruments, and so you will be, my friends, and so you will be. You will be blessed upon that journey of service. As you have been, so you will be.

May God bless you at this moment with His Love. Know that Matthew is with you and close, as are many. Yes, many do listen in on your conversations. Many do take seriously your words. So it is in your world, a place where disruptions can happen and yet many blessings may come. May you be blessed. God's Love is with you, my friends. Many are with you. God bless you.
