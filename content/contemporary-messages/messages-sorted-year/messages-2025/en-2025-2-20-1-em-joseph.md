# The Power of God's Love to Wipe Away the Mountains of Negativity

February 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Joseph received by Elizabeth Mack

My dear children, Truth rains upon you, upon all of us, every moment that we open to God’s Love. The Truth of it, the Truth of God, rains upon us.

You speak of negativities. They are little. They are like gnats in God’s universe. They will be gone with a flick of God’s Hand. They are going and love is increasing this very day, this very moment. Love is increasing on this Earth. As you are open to receiving the Father’s blessings, Love is flowing into this Earth. Through you, there is an upliftment, blessings, God’s Love expressed in this physical world.

You need not worry about those gnats of negativity. They are small in comparison to the Love of God. I am your brother, Joseph, and I come to you to speak about the power of this Love to wipe away what used to be mountains of negativity, now becoming gnats, the power of God’s Love is spreading its face across this Earth.

That is the plan for the salvation of humanity. You can accept that plan. You can open yourself to receiving that plan, knowing the Love, knowing the care that your Father has for each one of us. It is not a difficult choice, as you feel His Love flowing down into your souls at this very moment. Who would not choose this? God blesses His children in many ways. Trust, extend your faith and know that you are cared for. You are greatly cared for.

I am your brother, Joseph, the father of Jesus. I will continue to be with you through some of these changes that you call Earth changes. May God bless you each and every one. My soul is filled with love for you all, so filled. May God bless you.
