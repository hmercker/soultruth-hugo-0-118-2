# The Yogas of Love

September 13<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear friends, it is I, your brother, who comes in the love of God, Yogananda.

I have been listening to some of the discussions, and I wish to augment and add a few things which I hope will be helpful, not only to those in this circle but beyond. I wish to talk about the differences between the path of self-realization and the path of God-realization. I, a small yogi from what is now Bangladesh, was initiated by my teacher, Sri Yukteswar, and sent to America under his guidance to teach a form of yoga we called Kriya yoga, which allows the energies to flow through the body to promote health and peace. I took this to America and around the world to many thousands of people, and this type of meditation, which in some ways is traditional, allowing one to go inward, to be calm, to be clear, to relax the mind, to open the heart, and to feel the soul. This path in the natural love, as you would say, can purify the soul, and it brings those who are out of harmony into a oneness, into a peace, into a calm. But it is not the path of transformation of the soul, and that is a God-realization and the path of Divine Love. What if we were to put these two paths together? For those who have difficulty being calm, of calming their mind, a mind in a world, a material world which everything is focused on the mind, kriya is beneficial for, despite the mind being how decisions are made in your world, you wish to be in your soul. For many, it is quite difficult to quiet the mind. I would tell my students then, and I say now, if your mind is too busy, talk to God. *“Dear God, put my soul in your soul. Open my heart, that I may feel your presence and your love.”* As you have these thoughts, you have raised your consciousness now, you have opened up to receiving, and then you open up to the love of God, Divine love. If you wish to use words, you may say, *“Dear God, touch my soul with your love. May your holy spirt come and bring this great love into my soul.”*

Beyond the words is your intention, the intention of every soul to be at one with its Creator. This is a choice one can make, and this is a choice that none will ever regret. For, in the oneness of the soul with the universe and with Creation, there can be great joy, but it is not the joy of connecting with the Creator of the universe, and that joy, that bliss is eternal and never-ending. You can think of it as traveling through the expanding universe, and ever more feeling the spark of Creation in your soul, one foot on the earth, the other in the celestial heavens.

We invite you to choose this path, to get calm, to talk with God. Let your prayers ascend. Let your heart open, that God may touch your soul and transform it from the mortal to the immortal, from the human to the divine angel. This is the yoga of Divine Love. I hope that this path will lead you to the fountainhead of God’s love and for your soul to be ever blessed, transformed in the great love. My wish for you, dear ones. With all my love and blessings, I thank you for this time and for allowing me to come. May the love of God be yours. I love you, and may God bless you.

I am Yogananda.
