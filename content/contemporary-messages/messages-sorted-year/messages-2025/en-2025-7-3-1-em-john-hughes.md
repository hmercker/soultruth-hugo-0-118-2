# The Veil

July 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John Hughes. I desire to speak to you about the veil and the separation that it places between those of you in the flesh and those of you in the spirit world. It is a very thin partition, one which you cross frequently as you sleep. Its purpose is to protect your physical being from some things that might otherwise affect you in a less desirable way, but it is a veil, and somewhat permeable.

Crossing over is actually beneficial, for it starts souls upon a road of redemption, unlike life upon this Earth, which masks so much of God's Truth. Of course, you miss your loved ones, but only if you do not realize that they live and they are working toward a close relationship with God. People in this circle can certainly appreciate that. Your prayers will help them. Your loving will help them. You may see them when you sleep and, of course, when you transition. All is not lost. All is moving toward greater harmony, greater love and fulfilling purposes. May you come to know the truth of this. Your love still touches them. Their love touches you. It is only the flesh that you may be missing.

May God bless each and every one of you in this circle. May you come to possess the truth of what I have said. I am your brother, John Hughes. My love for all of you is great. My sister here feels my love all the time. There is no separation with love. God bless you.
