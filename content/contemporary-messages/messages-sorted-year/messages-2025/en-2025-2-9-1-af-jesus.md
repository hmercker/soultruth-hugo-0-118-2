Jesus received by Al Fike

… touch each soul present, for all it requires is for you to have a sincere desire to receive this gift from God, the Essence of His great Soul. I come. I am your brother. I am your friend. I am Jesus and I come to pray with you this day, to be with you in love and to walk this path together. My desire for each of you who walk upon the earthly plane is that you may know that I am with you and that you may discover that the angels of Heaven are with you. As you seek the highest gift of all, the blessings of the Celestial Heavens, the light of the angels, are with you, protecting you and guiding you, for God has sent His angels to uphold you.

It is for you to know and discover these blessings, beloved children of God, that in the heart of hearts, in your soul, this knowledge exists. It is important that you push aside all impediments that keep you from this knowledge, that you are with God in the innocence of a child, that you are with God with the desires and aching of the soul, that you are with God countermanding all conditions that are of the earthly plane, embracing and accepting the Light that is God's Touch and the blessings that come with an aching soul seeking at-onement with God.

We are all God's children. We all walk upon this path. Each has their own place upon it. Acknowledge one another as your brothers and sisters. Acknowledge all children of the world as God's children. May your love flow, your compassion, your wisdom and your grace that comes with this inflowing of Love be with you as you travel upon the earthly plane. For if you are in that condition of grace, of light, of desire to serve God, you will be that instrument that your souls long to be. You will touch others who are in need and who wish for comfort, the great Comforter which is God's Love.

Be strong in light. Be true to your own soul's longing and carry the truth as a banner, that you may inform your brothers and sisters of its veracity and power to transform and heal, to bring joy and light to any and all souls who seek this gift. We walk this road together as God's instruments and we shall continue in this service. I am with you, beloveds. I am with you always.

My desire is that each one of you shall know the transformation of God's redeeming Love. That it is given freely and abundantly. It is for you to accept and embrace in prayer, desire and thought. That as you walk the earth, your deeds shall reflect the power and grace of God's Love. That you shall be guided by the Heavenly Father, protected and embraced always. That your loved ones may know the benefit of this, those who are on the earthly plane and those who walk in the world of spirit.

May they know the grace that you know, the blessing that you know. May they see for themselves the light that you carry, for they are with you often, especially those who are in the world of spirit. They seek for truth. They seek a way to greater joy and happiness. They seek you, beloveds, as their teacher and guide, for you have that special bond of love with them and that is a powerful blessing for them. Seek to be used as often as you may. Seek to be that channel of love with every breath. Seek to be in the grace and blessings of God and that that may flow and pour through you to everyone you meet. In this way, you do my work. You are my disciples.

I urge you forward, beloved souls, forward upon the path that shall lead to at-onement with God. You are in His grace. You are blessed at this very moment. Open wide to this deep Touch from the Holy Spirit and know that you are loved dearly, powerfully and completely. You are loved beyond measure. You are loved in a way that is of God, that is this unique and wondrous Love, the Essence of God pouring upon you. Be true to your soul's longings and know the freedom that comes as the gift, the great gift of the Father's Love, is bestowed upon you.

My beloveds, we are together, unified in this desire to be blessed, upheld and transformed by this gift. Open, open and receive, honouring the Touch of God, the blessing of life and the blessing of greater life. God bless you. I am Jesus and I am with you always. God bless you. God bless you in Love.
