Thomas Merton received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear brothers and sisters, it is I, Thomas Merton.

I come as I promised my brother I would, and I come in the love of God. I have been waiting, as they say, in the wings to speak and I was encouraged to do so by those who had mentored me as I crossed into spirit. Most particularly, Martin Luther, who as you know, is a wonderful celestial spirit.

I was connected to the Cistercian, strict adherence, Catholics, and following the Benedictine and the Bernardian rules, we were called Trappist [^1] Monks. I resided for quite some time in a monastery in the state of Kentucky. I was quite an obsessive-compulsive fellow, and I hungered for knowledge. I believed very heavily in the power of the eucharist, what the Catholics call Holy Communion, the body and blood of Christ received. I wrote about this extensively and was encouraged by my Abbott to write a book about my journey thus far [^2]. I did study comparative religions but everything I shared was seen through the lens of this very strict doctrine of trans-substantiation and the mystical Christ I called it, believing the mystical body of Christ being the church, was the one true way, and all these other philosophies, religious beliefs, I benefited from, but viewed them as simply human blessings; good advice.

As I gained some notoriety as a writer, especially within the Catholic community, known for my expansive objectivity and viewpoints, and my bringing in other philosophies that could somehow benefit the true believers, I began to feel a certain despair because all my knowledge was not leading me to a place that I believed was within. I was not at peace. I began to practice a kind of Zen meditation to calm my mind and be centered. Perhaps if it were not for my sudden and early demise, this may have led me to a deeper prayer but because I believed everything was all one and within, very much aligned with Hinduism and New Thought, I didn’t have access to the truth. If I had known the writings of James Padgett, perhaps my heart would have been opened, my mind would have been opened in seeing past the limited doctrines and dogmas of my church and realizing all could be one, at one with the Creator, as Master Jesus was. And so, my life is an example in a way of how all the readings, all the philosophies, all the intellectual understandings, curiosities, do not add up to a single ounce of Divine Love. Much of what I wrote that was doctrinal was completely in error. My views on social justice, pacifism, and Eastern philosophies however were quite good and now I see they are in the realm of what you call natural or human love.

When I crossed over into spirit, I was mentored by many but very much so by Martin Luther and I read James Padgett and met James, a very bright celestial spirit and the harbinger of disseminating the truths that many of you know. I have also looked at what Brother Fike received from Master Jesus, which is a kind of reiteration, clarification, and expansion in the contemporary language of what James Padgett received.  I encourage you, if you have not read those, to do so as they are beautiful, beautiful messages, as well as those from my brother here, who gets practical advice, which I suppose I should be giving you, because this is what he likes to receive and share along with his music. But he has the heart of a poet and so what he gets can be less comprehensive but more concise and I am very, very pleased that he has allowed me to come through tonight as before.

As Lao Tzu once stated, the Chinese sage, *“the farther one travels, the less one knows.”* That was my life. Coming into spirit and being introduced to the realities of the teachings of Jesus, which became very clear once I could see, once the veil was lifted from my dogmatic brain and my willful blindness, I began to truly pray, and this quietness and calmness that I so fervently sought after on earth, came to me as God showered my soul with love. I saw it was not a matter of getting quiet first but really a matter of intention, of the longings in my soul, to feel the presence of God, to receive the New Birth that the Master clearly stated was the goal. Ask and you shall receive. Knock and the door will be opened. Finally, I did.

So, as many have told you, pray. Pray from the depths of your soul, with all your heart. Open to receiving this wonderful, wonderful gift, the greatest gift given to all who ask sincerely. I shall step back, and I thank you with all my heart for allowing me to speak. May what I have said help you in some way and may God bless you and all with His great love. Thank you. I am your brother and humble servant, Thomas Merton.
