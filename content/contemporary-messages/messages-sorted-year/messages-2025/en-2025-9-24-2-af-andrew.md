# Everybody Has an Opportunity to Progress

September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Paris, France

Andrew received by Al Fike

Yes, this dear soul [^1] suffered much, very repentant indeed. He is typical of many, many souls who have lived a life of depravity in the material world, he has sought redemption with God's Love and has found it. Remember this, that even though you may see individuals who are in a dark condition or confused and struggling in life, God gives them the opportunity to strive toward light, harmony and truth.

There are opportunities abound in this world and the next. Remember this when you feel the difficulties of the material world crowd around you, the individuals, so many who are desperate for something that they know not what. You are touching those souls as you pass by. Hope is being implanted within them as you pass by. There is an inkling of desire within them for God when you pass by. Every moment is precious and should not be wasted.

Whether you are aware of what God is doing through you, it matters not, my friends. It matters that you have your sight on the highest. Your condition may be of light. You may be a beautiful channel. What God will do with this is up to God, but you provide the opportunity for God to work through you.

My precious friends, I am Andrew and I love you.
