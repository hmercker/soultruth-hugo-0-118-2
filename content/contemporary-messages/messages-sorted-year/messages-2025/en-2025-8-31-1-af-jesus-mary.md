Jesus & Mary received by Al Fike

**Jesus:** I come. I come and gather you all together in light. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you. Yes, indeed, to escort you into the Hall of Peace, that you may have respite of the spirit, soul and mind, that you may come to know what is truly important and powerful in terms of your existence and progression upon life's path.

To nurture the soul with God's Love is the path that shall lead you to the greatest fulfilment and joy in life. When a soul is recognised and nurtured, loved, understood and allowed its expression within you, then you are truly complete and you are able to take the steps forward in light, truth and love. You are able to become one of God's beautiful lights and beautiful channels of love. As you continue to grow in this and be upon this Path Divine, so God will guide you and God will envelop you in Love. In this way, we are all brothers and sisters, are we not? Seeking this highest of blessings, seeking to know ourselves and to know our Creator. In this, you may come to know us in the Celestial Heavens and be our friends, as we wish to be yours, to walk upon this path in light and to be truly light.

We continue on this journey together. I am with you and I love you. I am truly your brother and friend. I shall be so for all eternity. You are part of my family and I am part of yours. We, in God's grace, shall know the wonderments of a soul awakened and transformed, the wonderments of the journey of the soul towards at-onement with God. In this, many experiences, many insights, revelations and visions will come. God will give to you all that you require, all that you desire to know in truth, to know to guide, to know to be in joy. All is given freely. We are together, seeking these gifts and blessings. May our souls open wide to a great inflowing of God's Love. May we know the joy of it, the wonderment of it, the depth and breadth of it and how profoundly beautiful this gift is.

I pray with you, my beloveds. I sit with you in this Circle of Light and I am truly your brethren. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you, beloveds. Feel my love for you, feel God's Love for you, feel the angelsâ€™ love for you. It shall truly uplift you into the Hall of Peace and bring you the conscious awareness of this gift from God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.

**Mary:** I am Mary and I come with my beloved son who is the Master of the Celestial Heavens. He speaks truly of this Love that is the Essence of our Creator. He speaks truly of the wealth and glory that this Love comes from our Father into our souls and transforms us, as it did my son and me and many others who will surround you and protect you along your journey to our Father.

This Love binds one to another and all to God. It is the highest of Laws. It is the most joy that one can express. This Love is above all others, including a mother's love for her children. I say this to you as you know my son, who I loved deeply as a mother and who led us to our Father, this Love from God is greater still. We walk with you. We will continue to walk with you and we will welcome you when you enter the Celestial Kingdom. This Love has bound us, sister to sister, brother to brother, mother to child and all to God.

I am Mary and I love you with this Love from God that is unshakable. May you be open to God's blessings as God pours them into your souls.
