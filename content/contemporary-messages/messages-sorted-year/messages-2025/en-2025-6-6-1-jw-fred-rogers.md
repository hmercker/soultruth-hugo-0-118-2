# Serve the Children of the World

Fred Rogers received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Fred Rogers.

Is it not a beautiful day in the neighborhood? Are we not all children of God?

As you feel the joy and the lightness of God’s love and grace, you get a sense of children playing freely, of how they trust, how they are unconcerned. And of course, not all children have that privilege, and I work with those who cross over. And so, whenever you can relate to a child, whether it be your own or another’s, bring them love, serve them that they may serve the world. Encourage them that they are not stymied. Show them kindness. Teach them how to share. For they are the future. And when you can, make them aware of their angels in whatever way you feel guided to do, so that they will truly know they are watched over, just as you are.

If you can pray with them in a manner that is acceptable to them to connect them with God, or even with just love, the love they feel from you is a love they will never forget. For each one of you, can remember as a child someone who was so kind and so loving, who may or may not have been a family member, touched your heart, and even now, some of those are with you.

For it is our joy, our delight to be at your call and to assist you, always respectful of your free will but always encouraging, always willing to be of assistance in lifting your spirits. 

May all the children of the world be cared for and blessed, as you are blessed in this beautiful circle. Of course, I wish to say hi to my dear friend, Phil, a beautiful brother. Talk about a kind heart. The world would be well to be as Phil. But to all of you, here in the Divine Love neighborhood, all my love, all my blessings, and gifts from God above. May they be yours. I thank you. I am your brother in Christ.

I am Fred, Fred Rogers.
