Jesus received by Al Fike

God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you this day. I come to tell you that the divine blessings pour upon each one of you, as God continues to uplift you. His desire is to ensure that you will enter into the Celestial Kingdom at some time in the future, as you grow and expand in the Father's Love, this Truth that I came to teach so long ago. It warms my heart to see that you follow the way of this Truth, that the power of Love is the only power that you require to be transformed and awakened.

This gift from God is yours. It is given freely and abundantly. It is given in accordance to your desire. Open yourselves wide to this blessing, beloved souls, seekers of Truth. Seek out your Heavenly Father. Know that in your search, in your prayers, as you continue to sound the depths of your soul, God is waiting there for you and shall always wait, never to forsake you, my beloveds, always to embrace you in the power and glory of His Love, His Essence seeking out your soul as you seek out His Soul. May we be in accord together, beloved souls, a harmony of souls singing your Father's praises, singing out collectively in this unity of love that you may truly know the blessing, that it may be palpable and true to your experience and your prayer.

These things that God has to give are the most powerful blessings that you might receive. To go directly to the Source is to be within the highest aspirations and alignment of your soul in relationship with Godâ€™s Soul. Know that you are truly blessed, my beloved brothers and sisters, that we walk this road together, always and forevermore, that we are truly God's children, claimed by God, His Love redeeming us from all conditions, all that is not in harmony with His creation and with His Laws of Love.

We walk together, my beloveds, hand in hand, truly one family in the Truth of God's Love. I am close to each one of you. I will continue to lead the way for you and for others. As we seek for at-onement with our Heavenly Father, so we are unified in this desire, a desire that originates deep within our souls, that need to be close to God, our Creator. A closeness that once was before we incarnated and now a closeness that, though different, will provide the comfort, the blessings, the Truth, the strength, the peace and the joy that comes with His Love. All is given freely, beloved souls. God is eager for your yearnings and prayers. God shall answer in all the power and glory that you are willing to receive, to open to and to embrace. You determine the extent and power of God's Touch upon you. It comes from desire, a desire pure, a desire that is deep. My beloved brothers and sisters, shall we pray together, seeking this highest of blessings? We are truly united and in the harmony of our beloved Father's Touch.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am Jesus. I come because I love you and I wish to pray with you, as do many angels and bright spirits. Even your stellar friends join in these holy moments, communion with the Great Soul of God. God bless you, my beloveds. I am with you, forevermore. I walk with you until that time comes when you are able to enter into the Kingdom that is of God and His Love. God bless you and keep you in Love.
