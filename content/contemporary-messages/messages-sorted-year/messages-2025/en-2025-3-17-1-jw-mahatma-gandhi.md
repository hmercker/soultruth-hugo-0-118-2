# Live at Peace

Mahatma Gandhi received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Gandhi.

I came tonight with my brother Yogananda, and I was very pleased that the beautiful sister read [my message](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2020/the-love-of-god-brings-peace-jw-30-jun-2020/). I wish to say this: In my time on earth, in my political struggles, my spiritual longings, my devotions, my family, my walk, I came to understand that there was nothing I could kill for, but there were many things or at least a few very important things I might be willing to die for. I tried to balance my spiritual life, the great peace in my soul, with my work in the world. Since you all do not live in ashrams or monasteries or temples, you too live in the world, and so you must deal with the darkness, but know this: as you allow your souls to be in prayer, to be in the love of God and His grace, this will determine your actions. In grace, you cannot harm another, but you can influence others in the power of peace, in the power of love, and with a light in your soul shining a light upon the darkness. You can change the world. This, I know, seems a formidable task, and it is one not all wish to be engaged in, and yet all live in the world. So, whether you decide to be an activist as I was politically or a devotee of God (as I was and am), do it in peace, that great peace that passes human understanding and is in the will and the love of our Creator. Be a lamp unto the world. Be at peace.

I thank you and my brother here, and I love you. We all do. May God bless you and keep you.

I am Gandhi.
