# A Healing Lesson for Our Development Circle

April 26<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Running Springs Retreat, Running Springs, CA, USA

Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you. It is Keea-atta-Kem. Our dear daughter is experiencing a series of reactions that begin with the nerve within her neck that is connected to that area that feels uncomfortable to her. When the energy of spirit, of us, coming to be in rapport with her, it stimulates and compresses this nerve problem and causes coughing. In time, this reaction and reactivity will lessen and she will feel comfortable once again. It is part of the development. It is not rooted specifically in the physical. It is part of a spiritual response that comes in prayer and in her instrumentality.

There are constrictions as well in this area of the throat. These constrictions have been around for a long time. They too require healing and expiation. There is trauma there that is the result of another's abuse. Although that abuse was not physical, it was emotional. Indeed, there is time now to release this memory and this condition. At the time, it was difficult for this instrument to release her rage and horror of how this individual behaved and caused her and her family pain. As you can see, this situation has many layers to it and will require more attention and healing to allow these things to resolve and to allow the compression within her neck to loosen. This is allowed by the pressure and energies, as you would call it, in this area, this chakra, to be resolved and come into harmony once more.

As you continue to grow in the Father's Love, as you continue to seek harmony and healing within your being, then these things become evident. They are manifest in different ways, but they give a message to the individual that there is a need for attention and love in the healing process of their being. That centre of disharmony may show up in many different areas in the body and in the spiritual centres of the body. Our dear daughter, who is earnest and desires healing, must come to the realisation that the focus of this blocked energy is in that area and is the result of painful memories, blocked expression of those memories and repression of the conditions around that experience and memory. Prayer is essential and contemplating what is within that area of her body, in prayer, will bring a realisation and an awareness of its source. In that awareness and realisation, she may pray to God to help her release this condition, to put in its place God's healing Touch and Love within her, releasing the encrustations around her soul that are manifesting in this way.

Humanity is a very complex creature. There are many layers and levels of disharmonies and interactions of components of the individualsâ€™ makeup and composition. It is important to realise that there are many, many components and many working parts within the human body, the spirit and the soul, all interacting together, all within one complete being, which is a human being. Send your love to this beautiful instrument. Help her to be soothed and at peace, to release all impediments, all conditions that are not in harmony with love. We will play our part in the healing process. We will give of our gifts, our channels of love for God. For God loves this beautiful soul so greatly, so powerfully, that love will heal. Love will remove. Love will help this dear soul release all impediments, all conditions that bring disharmony, that are contrary to peace and that are an impediment to the body and the spirit.

The highest and greatest healing of all comes from God in His Love, that Substance that pours within, that is given freely from God's great Soul to yours. This brings the soothing Touch to all areas, all pain, all discomfort and all that is not of harmony. How generous is God in His desire to bring you, each of you, peace, to be free of pain and to be free of those conditions and memories of the past as it brought pain and to replace these things with love, love and light, the expansiveness of light, that allow that which is restricted to be freed and the flow of the energies of the body, to do so unrestricted, to bring health and vitality to all parts of your being.

God has gifted you with a beautiful body, a body capable of many things. God has gifted you with a wonderful spirit that enlivens all parts of your body, your being and your consciousness. God has given you a soul that is filled with wisdom, love and light, that empowers the spirit and that empowers the physical. Indeed, all these beautiful parts of you desire to be in harmony, to be loved, to be blessed, to be given to, to be vital and beautiful.

God bless you, beloveds. Feel the rising of these conditions that are not truly a part of you, my daughter, and wish to be released through your breath and through your prayers and desires to be whole and vital and free of all impediments. God will give you the strength, the capacity to heal and to be clear of these things that you so desire to release and be healed in the glory and beauty of God's Touch, His grace upon you in loving harmony, a blessed gift of Love and Light.

God bless you. I am Keea-atta-Kem. I come to add to your knowledge and understanding of this situation. God bless you, beloveds. I am here to heal and to assist in your efforts to heal our daughter. God bless you. I love you, each of you, each of you.
