# Come to Know the Truth, Power and Glory of Love

September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Harrow Retreat, Harrow, UK

Isaiah received by Al Fike

(â€¦) His Love to awaken you. I am Isaiah. I come with the Master to encourage you forward upon the journey of discovery of your soul. For this is the journey that all must take and come to know in their own way, the truth, the power and the glory of Love.

God bless you, beloved souls, upon that journey that you must take. Whether you decide today or in 1000 years, it will be taken at some point. The choice is yours as to when you make that first step to awakening to the glories of your own soul, the wonderment of your own gifts, all that is you made whole and realised in Love. It must come one day. Why not this day? Why not this day?

God bless you in the great benediction that is God's Touch upon each one of you. Embrace this Touch, for it will change you forever. The peace that passes all understanding is yours at this moment. Embrace this with humility, grace and true awareness. It is yours, given freely. God bless you. I am Isaiah. God bless you.
