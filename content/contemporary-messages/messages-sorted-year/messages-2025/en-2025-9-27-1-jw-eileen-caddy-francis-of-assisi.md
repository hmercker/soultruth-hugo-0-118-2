# Creating Sanctuary begins with one small Step

September 27<sup>th</sup>, 2025

England Retreat, Bassingham, UK

Eileen Caddy & Francis of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

**Eileen:** I am here, Eileen, your sister and friend, in God’s love, and an inhabitant of the celestial heavens. I, too, wish to speak on creating sanctuary, not only from the viewpoint of my experience in doing such a thing, but in overlooking and overseeing your community and the various points of view, the diversity of cultures.

There is a great need to come together, and along with this need is a great possibility. What you create will sustain your work, provided with a protective landscape.  Your desire for sustainability in sanctuary, for a holy place to come together in prayer, for safety, and for community, is worthy. One must start somewhere, and those of you who know my story, of starting from scratch as you might say, going simply on faith and the guidance that I received, extending a welcome to all to come and build and join, that this guidance was met with a tremendous response. You have access to an even greater way of communicating via your media, and so I encourage you to continue to explore what others have done and how they have done it and choose what you wish to put out there.

You have stated your goals clearly, so as not to be confusing, but your reach has been insular. And of course, you have perhaps justifiable reasons not to want to just extend openness to everyone. But I wish you to realize that those who respond, for the most part, will understand what you are trying to create. Those who come on board will come on faith, will come on hope, and will bring their gifts. But it will require starting with one small step; one example of how to live in this manner will inspire many, and this is what happened in my case, starting very small and ever-expanding.   Now you are aware that the spiritual thread was somewhat compromised, and though it did not end the experiment, when you lose a spiritual connection, it is like taking a side road and pausing on your journey, which is why we encourage you to have a very solid foundation, and that foundation is prayer and God’s love and guidance. This will sustain you, and so as the [dear sister spoke](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2025/en-2025-9-26-1-jw-care-darby-walsh/), you are close, closer than you imagine. It will only require a leap, and as you reflect on your lives and the leaps of faith that you have taken, you realize each one became a blessing, and you were always so glad you took that step. So, when you’re ready, we shall help you, and as the saying goes, if you build it, they will come.

And lastly, I shall repeat what has been said many times in many ways, as you seek first the kingdom of God, all things will be given to you. Have faith, be of good cheer. Don’t worry. All things in love are a blessing. I hope I have shed some light. I hope I can continue to encourage you and guide you, and I thank you and all those who have set their sights on the long-term, for that will make all the difference in the world. May God bless you and protect you. I am your sister and friend, in Christ.

I am Eileen. 
 
**Francis of Assisi:** My friends, I too, took a leap. It was an experiment that came from the necessity of my soul to be free, to be in nature, to be with God, away from the world, and my friends joined me in retreat.

And of course, you know my story to some extent, but what I wish to impart to you is the idea of a retreat that is so loving, so blessed, so sustained, that you don’t wish to leave. This is what happened with my brothers and later my sisters, and these communities still exist, albeit in perhaps a more modern form, and yet those who join come with the aspirations of their souls to be in communion with others in the love of God.

You know, at some point, whatever beliefs one brings, the reality of grace penetrates even the most dogmatic soul in the change that occurs, in the transformation of that soul, in the love of God. Is this not what you truly wish to establish on earth? I wanted to impart that to you in a way that I hope will help you envision your walk into the future, your community, your brothers and sisters, and the generations to come. I promise to help you in this. There are many here who are committed to helping you establish a Divine Love community on earth, in whatever form you wish to do so, and of course, I love that you have this vision of a sustainable, safe place of grace. God bless you. I am your brother and friend.

I am Francis. Go in peace. Go with God.
