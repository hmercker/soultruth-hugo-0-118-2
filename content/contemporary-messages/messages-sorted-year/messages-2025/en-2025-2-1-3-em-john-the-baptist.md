# There is a Great Work to be Done by Humankind

February 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Rock Hill, SC, USA

John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John the Baptist. You are saved. All of you in this circle are saved. You all have that one soul quality that saves you and will bring you to the Father’s Kingdom of Love in the Celestial Heavens but there are so many others, so many upon your Earth who are unaware, unknowing, even uncaring to know of this precious gift from the Creator.

If you so choose to participate in this love and this plan to teach people to love, you must first love yourselves and your brothers and sisters deeply and truly. For this gift can be received by each child of God upon the Earth and as you practice expressing this love so your brothers and sisters who are still unknowing and even unwilling, will come to that place where love becomes something that they desire. This is a great work to be done upon the Earth. This is a great work to be done by all of humankind to ensure the continuation of the human species upon this planet. This is an important work and one that you are all capable of.

May you follow your souls desires to perform this work with the greatest of love in accordance with God’s will for each one of you.  May the Father continue to bless you and His love be in your souls. May you be connected to the Father always. I am John the Baptist and I love each and every one of you.
