# Life is Not Intended for Toiling, Worrying or Being Downtrodden

Mary received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Mary. I come to uplift you, uplift you in love and uplift you in the grace of God. I urge you to open your souls and pray. Ask for God to inflow His Love into your souls, for this is what will heal the Earth, as our dear daughter has prayed. As the light grows with each one of you, so the possibility of your own healing and carrying healing and blessings to others is made possible by your prayers and your light.

My beloved souls, so many walk in the world in fear, anxiety and confusion. They are lost, often alone. Their hearts are broken because they feel unloved. This is not how God intended the world to be. God wanted the world, and still wants the world, to be in harmony and peace and that all of His children will know the fulfilment of love, whether that be in the natural love or the Divine Love, that all the love that is possible in this world may be realised and expressed.

Each of you is a great generator of love. Each of you can walk in the world as a light. Each of you has within your soul deep compassion, joy and understanding of what life is meant to be and what life is for. It is not for toiling, worrying, being downtrodden and burdened with worries and cares. It is for joy and love, the fulfilment of your soul in all its capacities and abilities to live in the material world as a truly spiritual being.

In this way, the burdens of the material do not affect or weigh you down, because within your soul is the joy of being alive, the joy of love, the joy and fulfilment that comes as your spirit is awakened and in the light. As you are fulfilled in this way, so you generate the light for God. Through you, God brings blessings and healing to the world. This is what you are meant to be and to live.

It is all about love. Love touching, enveloping and healing everything. Everything in your world can be healed in the love that humanity might carry. When God says you are the stewards of the world, this is what He means, that you are the generators of love, bringing healing, peace and harmony through you into the world. When you are God's active agents in this way, then no matter where you are or what you do, you are influencing and bringing light and blessings all around.

Be that channel of love and light, my beloved and beautiful children, for how else can the world be healed? In what way can harmony come if not with the foundation of love present in everything? It must be so and it shall be so, my beloveds. We will bring that blessing forward and God will use each one of us as His channels of Love.

We are with you. We love you and we shall grow in Love, for the Love of God is an eternal thing where eternal progression is possible and your souls expand without limitations. What a great instrument you might be to bring healing to the world if you expand in Love and that Love is a constant in your life, flowing, infilling you and flowing through you and around you. True Light, pure Light, beautiful Light, the Light of God's Love.

I am Mary. God bless you all, as the beautiful lights that you are and shall become. How glorious is God, who makes this possible, who brings these blessings forth? How loving is our Creator to bring the means of salvation for humanity? That way and means is simple, direct and can be understood by anyone if they but open themselves to its blessing. God bless you, beloveds. I love you all. I embrace you all in love. God bless you.
