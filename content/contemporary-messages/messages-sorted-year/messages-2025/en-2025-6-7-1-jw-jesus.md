# It is the uni-verse of song

Florida Retreat, Inverness, FL, USA

Jesus received by Jimbeau Walsh
 
I am here, your brother Jesus.

The Father’s love responds to the hope of this world to be at peace, the desire of the heart to be loved, the wish of the mind to be in harmony with the laws and the will of our heavenly Father, the body to be at ease, and the soul to be transformed. May your days on earth, whether they be long or short, be filled with hope. May your walk in faith speak truth and be present as love in the Father’s embrace. For each one now glows with the essence of the Father in their souls.

May you remember that our wish for each one of you is divine and nothing less. As you walk through this world and its materialism and its power struggles, for money, for control, your soul in the Father’s soul, in His loving hands, has the clarity to see what is truly worthy. You may begin with a simple question: What can I take with me from this world to the next? When you explore that with every fiber of your being, the answer is simple. What do you wish your soul condition to be? You need not struggle to be in communion with the love of God and in community with each other. It is a simple matter of opening your heart, following your soul’s desire, and all things will be given to you. Questions dissolve into the great truth of the oneness that you share with your Creator. Conundrums will become creations. The birds will remind you that this Creation is singing. It is the uni-verse of song. All things are emanating life.

So, as you continue to choose what it is you wish to carry forward, follow your heart’s desires and the perceptions of your soul as you pray in any moment to receive the great gift of the heavenly Father’s love. As the poetess has said, *“how God loves you, you cannot count the ways,”* and as my brother’s song goes, *“how God loves you, only heaven knows.”* Be with us in this bounty, effulgence, and magnificence of the Creator’s love. Be with us. Stay with us.

May you each be blessed with a great inflowing of the gift and know I’m captaining the ship, and God is putting wind into the sails. Know this and walk in faith. You are the hope of this world, and I love you. We all do. I am your brother. I am your friend. I am Master of the celestial heavens, and like you, I am humbled by the greatness of God. May we all be at one in His love and peace.

I am Jesus.
