Andrew received by Al Fike

God whispers into your soul, my beloved and beautiful friends. He brings you wisdom and Love. He brings Light. He uplifts. All that your soul requires is given by God on this eternal journey toward at-onement.

Be open to what God has to say and give. Do not take for granted what is given, but honour it. Allow the blessings to flow mightily within your soul. Allow its transformation to take place. Embrace this transformation willingly and with joy. In this way, you will find the journey of the soul one that is fulfilling and one that brings its powerful promise of eradicating all pain, darkness and disharmony within you. It comes in your prayers. It comes as God's gift, His Hand upon you, and it is given freely.

Do not hold back your love for God and do not resist His Love for you. For in this relationship, this unconditional love, all that you need and require will be given fully and without restriction. Be at peace, my beloveds. Be at peace. You will know what I speak of. We draw you into this great Hall of Light and Peace. Breathe deeply God's blessings upon you. Venture forth beyond this earthly plane and allow God to kiss you with Love, embrace you and bring you the fulfilment of your soul. For your soul was created for this, this beautiful Touch and blessing.

You have found the true purpose of soul. In finding this, you will find the true purpose of your life. Know the richness, the depth and the beauty of what God has to give. In this there will be joy, joy everlasting, truth clear, strong and deep, love that shall bring harmony to all things and wisdom that shall be the expression of your soul, my beloved friends.

I am Andrew. I have great love for each one of you. We journey together and we are in the grace of God, feeling the blessings of God as we enter into this Hall of Peace together. Allow yourself to rise up and partake of these blessings, dear ones. God bless you. Andrew loves you. God bless you.
