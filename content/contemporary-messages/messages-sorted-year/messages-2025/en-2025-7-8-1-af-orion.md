God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. You continue to shift in consciousness. Your perspective of the world changes. Your view of yourself, your view of life, is changing as a result of the conditions of your soul being transformed, awakened and filled with Love.

Be aware of these things, my friends. Be aware of how changes, though subtle, are indeed establishing themselves in your consciousness. As you continue to grow in the Love of God, these changes are inevitable. As you grow in compassion for yourself and for others, as you grow in insight into yourself and others, as you come to know God in a more personal way, all of these things are indicative of the changes that are happening within your soul.

You may choose to repress or ignore these changes. Often, this is done because you are engaged in the material world to such an extent that you do not see, feel, hear or know anything that is of the soul, because your material mind is so engaged that there is nothing evident in your life's experience. You continue to pray for this change. You continue to seek out your soul to be awakened. This must happen as you receive the great Love of God.

Yet, there is, for many of you, a war going on between the two. It is between the material mind and its level of consciousness and the soul mind, mediated by the spirit mind that seems to be aware of both sides of this coin, both perspectives, trying, in its way, to make sense of your life's experience and the choices that you make. Though this may seem like a complicated matter, it is not. It is a matter of choice always, to be with your soul, to acknowledge your soul and to nourish your soul, ensuring that this consciousness becomes an active and lively part of your being and, of course, like all else in your world, nourishing the mind and making this the predominant factor of your own reality.

Which will it be, my beloved friends? On any given day, there is that choice. Though some of you have no idea what the soul consciousness is, it still has its active properties and influence upon you. If you are introspective enough, you can see how that influence brings about the results of your thinking and doing. If you are willing to acknowledge and to see beyond that which is easily recognised as mindful thinking and as you choose to be within that soulful awareness, the thoughts and feelings of the soul, it will become readily available to you in time. You will know yourself in time, your true self. You will know God's whispers to you. You will know the whispers of your soul to yourself.

This reality is important. Without this reality, you do not know how to steer your ship, for the soul is the rudder and, if you are consciously aware, then you are empowered to make choices that are in harmony with the Will of God, harmony with the changing soul and harmony with light. Do not cheat yourself of this choice, the empowerment that God has given you with the wisdom and perceptions of the soul. You are given free will. You act accordingly, but often you miss the point when it comes to your own soul and the choices that you might make from that place, because the mind is too busy contriving what it is that it must do.

The assertions of the mind in your life are paramount for most of you. Yet, we are encouraging you to act and live in a different way, with the consciousness of soul determining the actions and thoughts of your being. May you come to know this part of yourself as truly familiar and important. There is no need to be anxious about this. Often, resting into the soul comes with peace and a sort of confidence of consciousness that says, *“Yes, I am this individual. This part of me is true, real and worthy of my attention and my focus.”*

Be with your soul, my friends. You will not go wrong in decisions and efforts made in the material world. The soul is far wiser than the material mind. The soul can determine actions that often to the mind are filled with dilemmas and controversy. The soul knows the simple road forward. The soul understands its purpose and meaning in life. This wisdom, this clarity, this love, this capacity to know with knowing that is beyond the recognition of the material mind, empowers you to step forward in the world in a higher way, to choose the higher road, to be in that state of grace, freedom and joy that comes when the soul is recognised and given its place in your consciousness.

When that joy comes, when that sense of freedom comes, when that insight of wisdom comes, you know you are engaging your soul. As you recognise this, acknowledging and empowering your soul, so it will be forthright in your life, a powerful influence, that which you long for, the trueness of that which is in harmony with the Laws of Love, with the Will of God and the trueness of your own desires. I encourage you, my beloved friends, to be true of your own true self, to be awakened to what that is and to walk in the light and freedom that is your soul, whose connection with your Creator is causing dramatic change, powerful change, beautiful change. It comes to you drop by drop. Yet, the accumulation of this gift of Love within you is having its effects in powerful ways and beautiful ways.

May you find the path of the soul, my friends. Do not renege on this commitment, but reinforce it. Offer it to God every day and say, *“Today I want to act with my soul's awareness, strong and clear in my consciousness, that I might truly be in greater alignment with You, dear God, that I might truly be a light in the world and be guided because I am aware of my soul's capacity to know the Will of God.”*

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion, your friend. I speak truth to you, as usual, and I love you, as always. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
