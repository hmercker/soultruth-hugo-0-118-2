April 24<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Prayer Group, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Andrew & Goldie received by Al Fike

**Andrew:** We do indeed have purpose. Each day will have its purpose specifically and generally. Of course, coming together with your brothers and sisters to pray is an important purpose, but there are also blessings and benefits that will come to each circle, which will be somewhat unique with each day. We are orchestrating from our side, as you have indicated, dear daughter, the events and manifestations that will bring many blessings to each individual who gathers together in love.

You must consider that in the locations that you gather, there will be benefits of light that emanate from your circles for those in that vicinity. Each of you will grow and flourish spiritually from your purposeful gatherings. There is so much that we can accomplish when you are together in the flesh. Do not let negative forces impede or restrict you from joining into these gatherings. Rather, be of good faith and know that each individual who travels and makes their way to these Circles of Light will be blessed, protected, loved and inspired.

Every effort that you make is blessed and will bring its blessings to others. Indeed, there is much to be accomplished, openings that will come to individuals, a deeper insight into God's Truth of Love, a beautiful reconciling of each soul to God, a blessing of peace and joy. We will furnish guidance for each individual as they come to pray in this Circle of Light. Each will be blessed. All is well, beloveds. All is well upon this journey that you take. Indeed, God's instruments continue to work in the world and to bring the blessings of His Love to many.

May you be blessed, my beloveds. May you be blessed and feel the peace that surrounds you and escorts you upon your journeys. I am Andrew. I love you. I am close, as you know, and will be very close as we continue in this work of love, bringing greater light to the world and to be loving instruments for God. God bless you. Andrew loves you. God bless you.

**Goldie:** â€¦ joy, my friends. I am Goldie. I will be close as well. Indeed, I love this dear daughter's silliness and way of uplifting others. Though silly it is, it helps many to shift from the seriousness of life, to be joyful, filled with lightheartedness and lightness of thought. Any way that can bring God's children away from the challenges of a life on Earth is blessed and beautiful. As you continue in your ways to uplift, your ways to teach and to inspire, we are with you. So many are with you, with each individual who you will meet.

May the blessings of God's Love bring joy, bring truth and bring upliftment. I am Goldie and I love you. I am close, so close. God bless you.
