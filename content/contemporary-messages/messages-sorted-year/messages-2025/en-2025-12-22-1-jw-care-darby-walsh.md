# There is not a Hair's Breadth

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the love of God be upon us. I am your sister in Christ. I am Care.

‘Tis the season to sing a joyful song unto the Lord. ‘Tis the season to give with the gift of God’s love in your souls. More precious than any material and everlasting. Of course, there is tradition and ritual, and so many worshipping the Master, and yet, as you know, those who pray with deep longings and faith, their prayers ascend to the Father.

Though the vastness of God’s Creation is beyond measure, awesome beyond words, there is not a hair’s breadth between His love and your soul. In times of need, in those times when you feel separated, unable to connect, remember these things. God is ever-present, and your prayer brings the reality of the Divine Presence and the substance of Divine Love into your soul, whatever your circumstance. When you let your longings supersede all your other desires, when you let the world go, so that God may bless your soul, His Love Divine is here, and we celebrate the birth of the Master for bringing the second birth and eternal life to the world. You can wrap your love up in the rituals that the world expects, but I say when those presents are opened, the love will shine through, and though you may not be a great singer, when you sing unto the Lord with all your heart, He listens.

So, during this time of celebration, during this time where the light begins to outshine the darkness, may you all walk into the new year shining the light of God’s love. May you remember us, that we may walk with you, and I remind you ever again, when you ask, we come. So, there is no need to be overwhelmed with trouble, for the truth is every prayer is answered when it comes from the soul. When you can remove yourself from the emotion that clouds your perception, the emotion that can overwhelm one and create a feeling of helplessness, utilize your will. *“Dear God, I am lost at the moment. Dear God, I am bereft of the feeling of Your love. I am overwhelmed with my circumstances in my life. I cannot seem to get past these barriers. I ask that You will bring Your love into my soul in this moment, that Your most holy spirit may come and deliver it into my soul, transforming me, freeing me, healing me, in the wonderous gift of Your love.”*

Let us be still, let us be open, and let us live the joy of this glorious gift through all our days on earth and in spirit, for God is glorious, graceful, all-loving, merciful. With all the love in my soul and my heart, I shall step back in this blessing, and I thank you, this beautiful group that we are so proud of, and I thank my beloved for taking this message and for staying close all these years. It brings deep joy to my heart. God bless you all.

I am Care. Merry Christmas.
