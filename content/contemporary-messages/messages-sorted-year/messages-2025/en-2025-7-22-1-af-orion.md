Orion received by Al Fike

Your world is on the verge of great storms, my friends. I am Orion. Clouds are building. Conditions are intensifying. Yet, the world goes on, often oblivious, often wondering about their future and not realising that the future that humanity has created for itself is not sustainable. In their naivety, they think that those in power, those who have mental acuities and capacities, will solve these problems and will bring about a resolution of the dilemmas of life.

Yet, humanity is so naive when it comes to taking responsibility for their own actions and suggesting that outside parties will solve problems that they find difficult to comprehend or to tackle for themselves. In some ways, this naivety is something of light, for it does not bring worry, anger, frustrations and concerns to light. Thus, so many are able to function and be in the world without those obstructions holding them back from their life. So, there is a silver lining to that cloud. Yet, there needs to be more of a focus upon the spiritual endeavours and undertakings of each individual, to be with their Creator, to be in harmony with their own creation. These things are necessary and required at this time.

Many will not take heed of this. Your humanness suggests that you will continue to be oblivious. Yet, as the dark clouds gather, as the storm comes, there will be chaos, as in any storm. Storms have a power to cleanse, a power to recalibrate and start over. Humanity has weathered many storms, and you will weather storms ahead. In this, with our help and the help of God's Touch, the angels in heaven and all the good spirits and bright spirits, there will be wisdom shared, help offered, assistance in many ways, in order to help you and others reclaim your life upon this earthly plane and do so in such a way that you are in greater harmony and that the conditions of the human touch upon this world and all the disharmonies that are a part of it will not be present in the future. Those things will be wiped away with the storm. Those of you who remain will be informed, blessed, guided and given much to help you sustain yourself in the material world.

We will be there to assist you, not only speaking words which are comforting and helpful, but we will be there in physical presence to assist you to rebuild in a way that will bring greater harmony to your lives and to this world. There is so much that will need to be done, so much that could have been done in the past but not done. Now, the great storms of change must come. This is inevitable. It cannot be avoided. I say these things not to upset you, not to worry you, but to assure you that you will be protected and guided. These storms, though they will have their effects in your life, will not topple your life and take you from it. Yet, it will be a sobering time, my friends, a time where you will need to be very circumspect, contemplative and seek to be guided, an active instrument of God, to help those around you, to assure them and to show them the way toward harmony and peace.

You each have the grace of God within you. You each carry a great font of wisdom. You have the capacity to love many. Within you is a purpose that God has instilled from the beginning. Thus, in these times, that purpose will come to the forefront. You will know what you are to do. You will take your place amongst many to assist humanity to come back on its feet and to do so with greater harmony, love and desire to be in harmony and in love, part of God's creation. Each of you has something vital to give to the world. In that time of need, the world will be open and receptive to what you have to give. The time grows short. The storm clouds are very close. It is time for you to be in prayer, to be vigilant, to be true to your soul's desires and to be open to the assistance and communication that is given now and will continue to flow toward each one of you.

God bless you, my dear friends. I am Orion. I come with some concern, but with great, great compassion for each of you, for the struggles that you have now and for the struggles that will come. Know that we will be there, not at arm's length, but very close indeed. Be assured, if you feel pangs of anxiety, even panic, during these times, think of the words that I have said, that we are close. Your angel friends are close. We will be there to help you all as you stand up against the tumult of coming times. God bless you. Orion loves you. I love you dearly. God bless you.
