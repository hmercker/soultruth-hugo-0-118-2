# You Will Witness Great Changes Coming to this World

March 30<sup>th</sup>, 2025

First United Spiritual Church, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Josephus received by Al Fike

My beloved brothers and sisters, I am Josephus. I was a teacher of old. I am now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. You will all live to witness great changes in this world, because you have brought this world on the brink of collapse. God intervenes. We intervene. We hope that those of you who are of light, who understand this need for intervention, may also do your part.

For the world must change. There is too much corruption, anger, disruption, difficulties, pain and suffering in a world that was never meant to be so. God did not create the world to be in this condition of deprivation. God created the world as a habitation for all His creatures and especially for humanity. God laid out the plan, the way in which this harmony may come to be. Yet, humanity has the gift of free will and has chosen differently from God's Will and God's plan. Now the corrections must be made. Humanity must come to realise that it is not in control and does not have control, but is subject to laws that are eternal and universal.

You must learn these things, beloved souls. You must learn how to be in harmony within yourself, within the world and with God. When these things are learned and expressed to any great degree, the world will inevitably change, because the influence, the energies, as you call it, of your uplifted heart, knowledge and intention will contribute greatly for the changing world to take place. God has a plan to bring that change forward and to bring greater understanding amongst humanity.

You see, in this little church, your numbers swell. There is an inclination in many to seek out light, truth, greater joy and greater harmony. This inclination will grow into a movement that will be unstoppable. Indeed, the forces that hold Earth in dark conditions will be overcome by the forces of light, the desires for change and those who bring love. Love is the most transformative force in the universe. As you grow in Love, my beautiful friends, you will learn how to be an active agent for change in the world.  Consider what love is. Consider that you may receive greater portions of Love in prayer. Consider that as you reinforce and nurture Love within yourself, you are acting as an agent for God, for truth and for harmony.

May the power of love grow within you, my friends. May you truly know your own soul, the very centre and heart of love. May that grow with the blessing of the Father's Love. In this, you will be blessed, strengthened, awakened and transformed by Love. This is what the world needs. This is what you need. May you find your way upon that road and nurture those ambitions toward becoming an active agent of love.

May God bless you with His Love. May you bless each other with your love. May you bless yourself with permission to love yourself and love life. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Josephus. I am happy to speak today on a very important subject. God bless you all and good day.
