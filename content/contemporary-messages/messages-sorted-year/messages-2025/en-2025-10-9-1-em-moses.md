# Possession of Divine Love

October 9<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

Moses received by Elizabeth Mack

I am with you all now. I am Moses. I bring with me the strength of my convictions, the Truth of God’s Love within my soul, to encourage you all to live the truth, to know the truth, to have faith in the Truth of God’s Love for each and every one of you.

With this as a basis in your lives, you will be strong. You will walk this path with sureness of foot, knowing in your hearts and your souls that the steps that you take, those glorious steps, each one is solid and in a foundation of strength provided by the Divine Love and your true understanding and knowledge of it within your being. This sureness is greater than belief. It is knowing the path that you are on and the gift that you have been given is the strongest, most reliable path and gift that one could walk and receive. I challenge you to come to know the Truth of this Love, which puts you on this path directly to God and the loving arms that await each of His children. This is the blessing that I bring to you today, that you know the Truth of this Love in your souls.

May you forever be aware and conscious of this Love that continues to grow in you, whether you be in the flesh or in spirit. God bless you, my beloved brothers and sisters. It has been my privilege to come with this blessing. God bless you.
