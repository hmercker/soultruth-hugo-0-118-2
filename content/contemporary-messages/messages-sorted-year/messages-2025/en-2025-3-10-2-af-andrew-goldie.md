Andrew & Goldie received by Al Fike

**Andrew:** God bless you. It is Andrew. Yes, we are pleased when you distribute our conversations and our messages about the power and Truth of Divine Love. These truths must reach the world. Indeed, you are being instruments and facilitating that dispersion of truth into the world. We will support you in this always and we are pleased with your efforts thus far.

Beloved souls, there is much more work to do. There are many others to reach. As you see, the opportunities continue to open for all of you. There will be many more situations and open doors that will help to bring this message through. Each of you plays your part. Each of you is in harmony with God’s Will in this regard. Do you not feel the blessings, my friends, the beautiful blessing, the embrace of God’s Love upon you? This is an indication that you are following the right road and listening to your guidance.

Continue. Continue to listen and continue to act. We will continue to support and act from our side of life. All of us will work together in harmony towards the ultimate goal, which is to uplift humanity in light, truth and love, to bring peace to your world and to bring peace to yourselves. As we go along this road, there will be many surprises and many opportunities.

May you be blessed and open, receptive to the guidance of God, the Will of God, the Love of God and the blessings of your angel friends who come, your stellar friends who make great efforts to come and the bright spirits, all of which surround you. My beautiful friends, they surround you in love and they applaud you in your efforts. God bless you. I am Andrew. My love is with you always. My love is with you.


**Goldie:** … impediments of small-minded people impinge upon your thoughts and make for frustrations. As long as you are reaching for the highest and seeking the highest, those who are less than what you would like in this regard will fall into place. As long as you have a firm hand and a loving hand upon them, they will learn, they will grow and all of you will be a formidable force to bring the Truth of God’s Love into the world.

I am Goldie. I urge you to laugh and to be amused, rather than to be in a state of consternation, worry or care. Know that God has everything well in hand. You will find your way and so will all your friends, in the Love of God, in the harmony of God and in the purpose and Will of God. They will find their way. Give them love, support and guidance. This is what you all need, and it will flow from various places and avenues to touch others.

God bless you. Goldie loves you, beautiful dear friends on Earth. How we cherish you, how we love you and how we appreciate your efforts. Even when you bring through those people from far off, though they look rather strange, they are indeed beautiful in light and they are blessed too by God. So are you. We are all, as your friend says, human in the universe. God bless you. I love you. Goldie loves you.
