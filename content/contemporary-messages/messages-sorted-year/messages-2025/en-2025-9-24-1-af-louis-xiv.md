# Do Not Let Judgement Shroud Your Light

September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Paris, France

Louis XIV received by Al Fike

Beautiful souls, I am Louis XIV. I am pleased that you will wander through the halls of the palaces of mine and my ancestors, forebearers. [^1] I wish for you to see this as an opportunity to spread light, rather than an opportunity to pass judgement. For when you pass judgement, you close off that beautiful channel that you are. Your mind then puts a cowl over your light. God does not want you to be shrouded with judgement. God wants you to be open and free in your expression of love.

Yes, the ways and means in which these places were built, the conditions of those places in times gone by, were dark indeed. Yet do you not think it is time now to add light, to transform, to bless? For God uses every opportunity to bless and to add light. It is said that you should not enter into a dark condition without an attempt to purify. Even from this perspective, you are asking God to utilise you to bless, to uplift and to purify.

My journey toward a Celestial Kingdom has been a difficult one, as you can well imagine. I was most certainly a depraved soul when I passed over into spirit. Oh, how I missed the power and the glory of the days as the Sun King. Oh, how I yearned for them to return, but they could not return. For when one is in the spirit world, the laws that pertain to these things are completely different. I had to learn. I had to grow. I had to forgive myself and forgive those around me and the depravities of the extent of their lives, expressions of themselves.

When I realised that all we did was irrelevant to our soul's progression, all we did was contrary to it, I had to learn a new way. I had to be a new man. There were many spirits who assisted me, who taught me, who showed me the way. When I discovered the great blessing of Divine Love, which is the true sun, the true light, then I realised my journey to be in the light once more was possible. I was fervent in my efforts, indeed, much to expiate, to reconcile, to forgive, many years, as you would say in earthly terms, to do so. Once I had accomplished this, oh, the joy, the freedom, the truth, the understanding of truth, the cleansing of my soul and the expansion of my soul with the Essence of God. In this way, I became a true king. Of course, not in the way that you would think, but in the way that I became the master of my own kingdom and my own being. This is the only way that one may find redemption and healing and light.

No, I am not the king of anyone today. I am the king of my own soul, and I am joyful in this. When this instrument saw me dressed in rags, it was my way of saying, *“I may be a pauper in terms of material goods, but I am truly a king in terms of my soul.”* I carry on my journey, teaching others the Truth of God's Love, being humble, something that I knew nothing of when I walked here, being true to my Creator, a channel of love, as you aspire to be a channel of love. Oh, what you have avoided, my dear and beautiful friends, by the journey that you have taken up so early in your existence. A journey that I would not wish upon anybody in terms of expiation and darkness, confusion and pain. You are avoiding all of these things and you will find your way into great light. You carry a light. Now, can you imagine, as time goes by, how great that light will expand and how beautiful you will become?

I am happy to serve you, and I will be with you as you walk those halls. Together, can we not be a light in the world? Can we not be a channel of love in the world? In some respects, once you see what was created were the results of higher aspirations, to a degree, they may have been misplaced and misdirected. Yet indeed, the desire for beauty, the desire for harmony, was within me and others as we attempted to create this palace. It came at a heavy price to those who were under me, but indeed now this country has something to see and to appreciate, that may inspire, one never knows, that may uplift, bring some joy. I urge you to see it from that perspective, to be released from any judgement or ideas that what you see is a manifestation of sin, for the higher aspirations are not of sin. How one utilised and how one accomplished these things certainly was of sin.

So it is in your world. The sin sits beside the light, the evil one beside the saint, the lost beside those who are found. There are so many contradictions in your world. If you were to truly open your vision, your perceptions, you would be horrified at the multiplicity, depth and breadth of these contradictions. Indeed, no one is free of them. No one can say, *“I live my life completely in harmony with God's Laws in this world of yours.”* For every time you step out your door, every time you utilise some material benefit, something that makes your life easier, you are committing a sin. The world that humanity has created is rife with sin, rife with disharmony and it is killing your world. You know this. I suggest you become humble in your attitudes and your thinking. Say, *“Yes, I am a sinner too, but I also want to be a channel of love. This contradiction may exist in my life, but it is an attempt toward light.”*  It will be appreciated.

God will acknowledge your efforts. God is working upon a plan to awaken humanity and to bring all into harmony. You cannot be perfect, my beautiful friends. I tried to be perfect. I wanted everything to be perfect when I lived on this world. Where did it get me? Into darkness, pain and suffering. Indeed, I lived some time in the hells and I was in rags, a pauper in every respect. You, my friends, will not have that experience. You will find your way to greater light.

Be that light as best you can. Walk in your world as best you can, in compliance and in harmony with the light, love, truth and Laws of Love that you are aware of. You will find joy and fulfilment in this. Every moment is an opportunity to find fulfilment and joy. Be true to your soul's desires. Be true to that sun king within that is your soul. You will find that life will unfold in a glorious manner. One that is not full of pretense, one that is not overlaid and gilded by desire and deception, but one that is truly infused with the Love of God, the power of that Love, the glory of that Love. You will walk in the world humble yet free, powerful yet guided, blessed and doubly blessed.

God bless you, my friends. I am Louis XIV and I am happy that you are here in my country, spreading light. Be that channel, beloved souls, and all will be well. You will not suffer for your efforts. You, though not naive, will find that when you hold your head up high and pray to be a channel of love, that all other aspects of your efforts will be transformed by that Love and be of light. God bless you, beloved friends, and thank you.
