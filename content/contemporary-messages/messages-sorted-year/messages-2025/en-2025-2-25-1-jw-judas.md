Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother Judas.

My brothers and sisters, we are in a time of great change, and I tell you something you not already know and perceive, feel deeply. The changes that are occurring upon the earth as the earth restores itself are also occurring in the political realms, in the ideologies and philosophies that exist on earth. There is much fear and worry and I wish to remind you that fear, at its root, is fear of death. This death, however, may be the death of a job. It may be deeper, such as the death of a family member, a spouse, a child, or one’s own mortal being. There are many kinds of deaths. The other side of that coin is love and acceptance. This in conjunction with hope and faith brings one into a peaceful presence, whether it be in the natural love or better yet, in the grace of God.

One must remember many of the changes that are occurring have been brought about by the sustained prayers of so many on the planet, asking for peace, sustainability, and equality. The saying, the darkest hour is always before dawn, is quite appropriate at present and I would say, as you pray, hold that thought that the dawn is coming and the birth pains of a newer world, the labor pains, are what you are experiencing. This is also true on the spiritual plane, where one praying for the love of God, receiving it, must confront the walls and the attachments known and unknown that have become a part of them. This is the human condition. As the love of God begins to take hold and you begin to perceive these walls you have built, these attachments that you have made your own,  you begin to see the obvious which is that your soul needs none of these things. Your body may, your mind might. You have created many habits and you find when you begin to feel eternal life in the great love of God, you can let go and as you let go and you expiate what you have clung to, sometimes called your baggage, you begin to feel a freedom, a weightlessness, your soul being lifted above the material plane.

You know, if you were literally in chains, imprisoned for many years, imagine the sensation of being freed. I don’t know if it’s an appropriate analogy, but I can say, that the freedom one experiences in the love of God is bliss and joy and a happiness beyond compare. So, do not beat yourself up if you have not quite gotten past your fears, for they are the human condition, but as your prayers become deeper and you begin to feel the freedom of God’s grace, you also begin to know this is the way. This is the great gift, and this is your future. Your walk with God and the angels in love, in bliss, ever holding deep empathy for every soul. This will never leave you.

So, finally, I say to you, give yourselves a break. Turn to God. Not out of a sense of responsibility, but in knowing the joy the Creator’s love brings you and that you bring to the world. As the song goes, *“There is a light in the darkness, a light of love”*.

I thank you for this time as always and I shall come again, and I thank my brother and all here. Please know how much we love you, how beautiful you are, how blessed you are. I am your brother and friend, a redeemed soul in the celestial realms. I am Judas. God bless you.
