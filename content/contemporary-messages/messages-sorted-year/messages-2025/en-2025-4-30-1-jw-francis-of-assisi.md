# Leave Your Concerns at the Door and Embrace Each Other in God’s Love

April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Francis of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is my delight to come together with you on your retreat from the world as you leave your concerns at the door and embrace each other in the love of God with words from your heart and share your journeys with each other. For each one has a gift to give another. Each one has a story that will uplift another, give them insight, that each soul may be lifted, in ascendancy over the mind and the material world on these days together as you feast on the love of the heavenly Father and yet you fast from the allurements of the world and you make time for the blessings and guidance from the celestial realms.

May each one of you take away from this sacred time together in the Holy Presence the great gift of God’s love so that you may share your souls, without discrimination, with every soul you encounter. Let your words be filled with love. Let your walk be gentle upon the earth. Let your thoughts rise to the heavens. May your lives bless this world so in need. Bring your sanctuary into the world. Bring the kindness and empathy from your souls to your walk each day, each night, and when you awaken in the morning, be grateful for a new day as the birds welcome you with their song. May the grace of God be upon you all.

I am your brother and friend, Francis , and I love you as all here do in God’s love. Be in peace.
