Augustine received by Al Fike

May the blessings of the Father's Love continue to flow into your souls, beloved children of truth. I am your teacher, Augustine. I wish to speak today about the difference between faith and belief. My sincere desire is that you may discern between these two aspects of spiritual journey. Belief is of the mind. You may put together many words, many concepts and paradigms within your mind and think that you have accomplished a level of faith in God and in the truth.

This sort of belief is merely the forerunner to faith. Many who engage on a spiritual path begin with belief. Indeed, many of you have begun with belief. You have read passages that inspire you and excite you. Part of that excitement is your soul responding to the truth that you have read. This is a true beginning of the journey. Yet, when one experiences an awakening within the soul, when one truly understands, perceives and feels the inflowing of the Essence of God into one's soul, it becomes a building block of faith.

It is the experience and the feeling that indicate the truth of the matter, rather than a detached and reasoned approach. It is a revelation of sorts, a sense that God has touched you deeply. As that Touch continues to be part of your experience with God, your faith grows, for within you comes an unshakable knowledge and acknowledgement of the Truth that you are loved by God and that that Love is a real and palpable thing. It is within you and continues to grow within you. As your soul awakens through the many blessings and experiences that God has to give to you in prayer and in daily life, as you continue to integrate from the mind to the soul, that understanding and perception of soul, then faith grows strong. Your understanding of truth comes to you in a different manner. It is not the building blocks of the intellect that bring you to God. It is the building blocks of the mind of the soul, the awareness of the soul and the experience of the soul that give to you the gift of faith.

Indeed, I would ask you to have compassion for your brothers and sisters who just begin the journey and who are comfortable with mindful reasonings. Though within them is a strong and deep desire, a longing for God, the only way they understand God is through the mind, for this is how you have all experience life. You have all been trained and programmed, as you call it, to believe in reality that is of the mind. We offer you something different. God offers you something different, something that is truly not of the mind, but of the soul.

As you trust in this awakening of soul faculties and abilities to perceive,  your faith in the process is strengthened and grows to become a solid and immovable part of your experience. Faith does not, nor cannot be replaced by one experience or another. Faith is only built by the experience. The kernel of faith, the experience of faith, becomes an immutable and immovable part of your being, your soul. As you grow in faith, so the understandings and the experiences grow and that faith is added to and not expunged and redirected. Rather, it becomes a mighty oak from that acorn of faith.

This is a process that is not well understood upon your earthly plane. Many do not trust it, nor have belief in it, for they are too busy living a material life and utilising a material perspective of mind. Yet, in your experience of life, you have come to know God in an intimate way that is unshakable. You are coming to experience God as your foundation and source of Truth. The guidance that God has to give to you lays the foundation of your journey in life. As you shed the falsities and the lesser perceptions that come with the mind, so your faith grows and expands and becomes this mighty oak of which I speak.

That strength, that capacity to truly know and to understand, is not only a gift that God has given to you, but a gift that God wishes to give through you to the world. What you teach and share with your brothers and sisters must be based on faith, not based on conjecture and intellect, but true faith and true understanding. Yes, you will have to use your mind and your words to share with others. This is the way of your world. I do not denigrate that capacity. I encourage you to be simple yet eloquent in your words. If you cannot find your words when given the opportunity to speak, have faith that God will put them upon your lips. God will help you to express truth in such a way as to inspire the souls of whom you are speaking to.

There is much for you to learn, my beloved, beautiful students. As you grow in faith, that learning grows with it. Your understanding and clear perceptions of true, spiritual truth, the highest truths, will expand and grow as your soul capacities are awakened by the great gift of God’s Love. These mechanisms, these faculties and gifts that God has planted within you are all working together to bring about a new reality within your life experience. A new way of perceiving and a new way of acting and expression. The gifts that are coming will inspire you greatly. The faculties of your soul will absorb the Truths that God wishes to give and the guidance that God wishes to give, all predicated upon the Love that God is giving you at this moment and will continue to give to you as you open and desire this gift.

Faith is your strength. It adds to your capacity to know truth. It is your expression of love for God. It is your expression of your love for yourself and your brothers and sisters. Honour the faith that has grown within you and seek to strengthen it in prayer. Seek to understand it, for often you confuse faith with belief and you must grow to discern between the two. When you experience a note of true faith, it becomes an unshakable part of your foundational experience in life. The conjecture of the intellect is fluid and always moving and changing. Transforming into something new as a result of words or concepts shared with you and concepts that you imagine within your mind. These are two very different experiences in life. You must come to know that difference if you are truly to be a teacher of these truths, a channel of God’s Love, Light and Truth in the world.

Do not underestimate the power and strength of the faith that is building within you. It will serve to open many doors of truth for you. As your soul grows in this way, so does its capacity to know God, to know the creation of the universe which is of God and to know the universe of your own soul. Continue with your efforts, beloved students. Continue to be God’s children with humility, grace and faith. We will continue to journey together to develop our souls to such an extent that the expression of your faith will be plain for all to see and to feel its power, beauty and grace.

God bless you, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to continue to teach and help you to understand the journey that you are taking, the journey toward truth, the journey toward at-onement with God. All is given in love. All shall be given in love. God bless you, beloved students. God bless you.
