… changing, beloved friends, I am Orion.

Change is inevitable. It is a constant in the universe, but the change that you are experiencing is not common in your world. It is the change that comes with the development and awakening of the soul. As you receive more of the great gift from God, so your perceptions, your thoughts and your actions change because the influence of the soul is growing stronger. As you are well aware, the differences between the perceptions of the mind and that of the soul are quite marked in their intensity and in their perspective. As your soul grows, as the perceptions deepen and awaken, as you become more in alignment with that which is universal Truth, that which is of God, then the perceptions and illusions of the material mind start to weaken and falter. In their place comes the wisdom of the soul, its perceptions growing, deepening and refining in the Love.

I would expect that each of you will experience somewhat radical changes of perspectives and viewpoints. Indeed, there is often conflict between the two perspectives. This is where faith comes in, trusting and having faith in what is evolving within your consciousness, that of the soul, and being strong enough and brave enough to release time-worn and time-held perspectives that are no longer relevant to your life. It is your challenge, beloved friends. You have been engaged in this challenge for a long time. Change does not come easily or quickly. Perspectives do not grow instantaneously, although it is possible. Rather, you shift from one place to another in terms of consciousness gradually. This is more comfortable for you and, indeed, in a way, it is more harmonious. Yet, in time, the new perspective, the deeper perspective, the higher perspective must come to you. It is your responsibility to adopt and to integrate this new thinking, this new perspective.

If you do not, then you remain in limbo and, to a degree, in conflict between these two places. God has great mercy and great compassion for all of you and all the souls that have been created in the universe. God provides the ways and means for further progression and for each soul to find harmony and peace. This is done through the power of love. The Love of God is the most powerful of all love. It is transformative. It adds to the soul. In adding to the soul, the perceptions and experiences of the soul are changed. This is a basic law and one that you know well.

When there are discomforts and when there is inner friction, when certain memories, conditions and feelings that come up into your consciousness are there for you to observe and to, in a certain respect, relive, this is the result of change and recalibration of the soul. This comes when the great Love of God infiltrates those hidden and dark corners within. Accept this process. Have faith in this process, allowing these conditions to dissipate, allowing new perspectives and attitudes to emerge, allowing your emotional selves to find peace, to not be so reactive to the world and to be somewhat detached and yet attuned.

It sounds like a contradiction, but it is not. For attachment is also often a form of emotional stuckness, where detachment is where the emotions are not so attached to the experience. In this detachment, there is freedom. You are not replaying these emotional scenarios over and over again in your mind. Rather, you are finding a new way of being and experiencing life. You are finding a way to truly love yourself, to love your brothers and sisters and to love the world. This often replaces fear, judgement and difficulties that rise up from a mind distorted by life’s experiences.

You are cleansed of these conditions, these patterns of mind as the soul grows in strength, as the perceptions of the soul are accepted and integrated into your daily life and as you come to know love in all its forms and its transformative ways. Freedom, my beloved friends, this is what you long for within your soul, freedom from the human condition, freedom from your own personal pain, freedom from the distortions and error that you carry. All of this is replaced by love, by peace and by the true knowing of the soul. This is where you are headed. This is a reflection of the changes within. As these changes of perceptions and attitude continue to grow within you, be joyful, my friends. For the power of soul transformation is a living thing within you. It is having its effects. It is bringing you to that place of freedom and joy.

Release all conditions that are not in harmony with the Laws of Love. Allow yourself to be exalted in the light of love. Know the joy and freedom of a mind that is not entrapped by darkness, error, pain and all those things that you are well aware exist, but you have a deep desire to release. Be true to yourself, your true self and be free, my beloved friends. The power of Love brings us freedom. The power of your relationship with your Creator allows that Love to grow. Be focused on these things and freedom will be yours.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. I pray for your freedom. I seek to assist you in this. I am there, as are many, many beautiful, bright spirits, Celestial Angels, stellar friends to help you find that elusive freedom that your souls seek. May you find your way. May you spread your wings and fly. Ascend into the light. God bless you, beloved friends. God bless you.
