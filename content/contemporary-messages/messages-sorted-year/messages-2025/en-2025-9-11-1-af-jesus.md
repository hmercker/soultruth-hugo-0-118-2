# Opens Today's Circle

September 11<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Jesus received by Al Fike

I welcome you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to open this circle, to acknowledge each one of you. I pray that you will be receptive to the Father's Love flowing into your soul.

I urge you to ask for this gift. I urge you to open to all that God has to give to you. Know that you are surrounded by angels, that you are loved by God, that all that is in the realms of light, love and truth be yours this day, this day set forth as a gift to you, a blessing to each of you. Be true to your heart's desires. Be true to God and we shall walk into light together.

Blessed, blessed souls, my brethren, we are in the Light and the grace of God's Touch. Open, my beloveds, and receive what is meant for you, all that is meant for you. Beloved souls, my love is with you. I am Jesus and I pray with you. God bless you.
