# Come Closer to Your Celestial Angel Guide

October 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Beams of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am with you now. I am Joan, Joan of Arc. I come to join in this prayer with you, for upliftment is what you desire and a closer connection with our Creator.

These are your soul's desires. The soul has much wisdom and acknowledges the truth of your relationship with God, so we urge you to allow your soul to lead you in all things. Some of you experience your soul. Some of you use intuition to guide you. The less you use your material mind, the more you allow the wisdom of your soul to come forward and lead you to the path that is set out before you.

Our Father awaits your arrival. He awaits each one of His true children, truly all of His children, each and every one. We come to you, my dear brothers and sisters. We come to you to encourage you. It is a subtle encouragement in most cases, so listen carefully to the whispers of your soul, to the whispers in your heart, that we may develop a stronger rapport. Invite us to pray with you. Each of you has a guide who is from the Celestial Heavens and who is by you at all times. Invite your guide to pray with you. Form that bond that you may share communications between the two of you and thereby understand what it is that the Father desires you to do in each moment of your life upon the Earth, where there are so many distractions and so much chaos.
Come closer to your guides. Open your hearts and souls. Allow the wisdom of your soul and the guidance of your Celestial Angel to grow stronger and deeper, so that you know what to do. This will be very helpful in the very near future.

I am your sister, Joan. I love each and every one of you dearly. May our Heavenly Father bless you with all of the Love that you are willing to accept. May God bless you.
