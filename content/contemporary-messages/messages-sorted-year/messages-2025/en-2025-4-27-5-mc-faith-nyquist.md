# The Blessing of Expiation

Faith Nyquist received by Maureen Cardoso

I greet you, dear friends. I am Faith. Oh, the gift and the blessing of expiation, the encrustations upon a soul. I say a “blessing,” because that is part of the transformation and part of soul awakening, where those conditions that are from your human experience inhibit the light of the soul and create a blockage of God's Love coming in. As you know, this path is for the courageous, for the brave ones who desire to be changed. Part of the change is those conditions that are not in harmony, and that part of you that was once out of harmony, through the transformation and expiation, comes into harmony and alignment, alignment with God's Will and alignment with the Laws of Creation.

While it is never a comfortable experience, once that which has been prepared for its dislodgement has been completed, there lies a greater depth of an attribute of God, whether that be peace, joy, humility, love or compassion. When a soul is on the other side of this release, they feel a great relief and perhaps can even see the process through the higher lens of their spiritual eyes, recognising the blessing of having gone through this release.

Remember that it is also a free will choice whether you allow the release to happen or not. You may feel the rise of disturbance within you, whether that comes through the form of depression, anxiety, anger or worry. Rather than feeling these emotions, you turn away, which shuts this down. It holds these negative emotions in place. If you truly desire to progress on the Path of Divine Love, it is necessary to allow the experience of these negative emotions and feelings to come forward. Ask God to come into your soul, with the blessing of His Love to help along this transformation of these energies that hold darkness. Invite the angels to be close to you, to bring you their love, support, and healing ministrations. Stay centred and still, as still as you can, because what this will do is allow the fullness of your expiation process to rise.

While it may be very difficult to feel the blessing of the angels around you, or even invite the Essence of God into your soul while you are in the midst of this process, know that our love and God's Love are close. It is not possible for us to interfere, but what we can do is influence you to help you through the transformation of this condition. That is one of the roles that we, as your Celestial Angels, have a great imparting to mortals and spirits that walk the Divine Path. We serve you, not only to educate you, but also to bring healing, blessings, insights, inspiration and guidance.

Anytime you are moving through the process of a condition that is not in harmony with God's Love and God's Laws, allow yourself the freedom to take the space and time you need for your change to occur. Each one is unique in its requirements. You must come to know yourself in this way. For when you walk the Divine Path and you ask God's Love to come in, expiation is one of the most significant parts aside from receiving the Love, because the workings of this Love begin to change you. Choose wisely and allow yourselves the change and the blessing, and continue to walk your way home to your beloved Creator.

I am Faith, bringing my love, healing and blessings to each of you. God bless you.
