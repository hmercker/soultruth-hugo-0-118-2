Blessings to you, my beloved friends. I am Faith.

Make prayer the anchor to your life, my friends, for when you create your beautiful tent of light, do you not need to secure that tent with the anchors required, so that when the winds blow and when the weather changes, you have shelter that will be permanent? It is in prayer you build a light around you, but you must anchor that light in prayer, fervent and consistent prayer, so that when your life brings its challenges, you are anchored in light. You are able to cope with all that may be part of your life and within those events that swirl around you, when your soul is anchored with God, then you feel joy. You have wisdom rising up from your heart and soul, assisting you as you navigate daily life.

God provides all that you need, my beloved friends. God provides it with His Love, with His blessings, with all that He gives in life. Much is provided. When you are in harmony with God's provisions and God's Laws of Light, then there is joy and much can come through you and to you. For God gives you every opportunity to engage with life. It is your choice and what you choose to focus on and the efforts that you make in response to your daily life that make all the difference. When you anchor your life in prayer, then you are ensuring that the Laws of Creation will work for you, my beloved friends, that Laws of Love shall flow to you and through you and light shall build all around you.

Be prayerful, a prayer that is consistent and authentic and deep, and truly a part of the longings of your soul. In this way, many blessings will come and you will be guided in your daily life. Many surprises will befall you, many blessings and many opportunities to serve. This is the way of the soul seeking the nourishment from God, His Divine Love, and the way of the soul interacting with God and with life, which God has created. So much comes when you set your priorities toward God and those priorities are expressed through prayer and openness and receptivity, listening to God's guidance, listening to the truth, expressing love in everything that you do. It is a simple life, not particularly complicated. There are not numerous rules and edicts to follow. The foundation is love. The foundation is expressing your love toward God and seeking God's blessings and guidance. All the rest falls into place when these foundations are set and your house is secure.

May you be blessed and all the beauty and wonderment that is God. God's desire is to bless you abundantly. May your desire be to receive abundantly and to serve as a tribute and love for God. God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Faith and I love you so, my beautiful friends on Earth. We will continue to express our love for God, our faith in God's guidance and plan for us and that His Love will truly transform us. God bless you all. Faith loves you dearly. God bless you.
