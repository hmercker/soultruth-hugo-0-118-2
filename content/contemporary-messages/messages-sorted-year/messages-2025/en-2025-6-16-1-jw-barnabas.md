# If you wish to serve the world

June 16<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Gibsons Prayer Circle, Nashville, TN, USA

Barnabas received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the love of God touch each soul. I am Barnabas.

When I walked the earth so long ago with my brother Paul, preaching to the Gentile and the Jew, often struggling to make peace between those two camps, putting forth what we believed was the true gospel of the Master, I can say that we did have some of it quite right. I wrote about the path of light versus the path of darkness. I wrote about the Master being the mediator between God and man. But I tell you this, it was really the gospel of love that made the difference.

If you were to have a prayer with a Jew and you said let us pray to the one God, to receive His love, I think the response would be quite good, open. The same with the Muslim, although the word for God may be different. As for the Jews, they usually say “Hashem”, meaning The Name, and the Muslims say, Allah, but these two groups also believe in the one God. As did and does Jesus and all of us here.

So, when you come in prayer, first and foremost in your day and you open up with all your heart, all your soul, and asking God to touch you with His love, you wait, and you keep opening, and you let everything go, and you begin to feel the glow of the love in your heart, and the Holy Presence. And then perhaps you walk in the world, or you go about your day in whatever is presented, and you respond in love, with God’s love.

As Paul wrote about speaking with the tongues of angels and so forth, and (speaking) without love being as a clanging bell, we experienced this, for often no amount of our preaching made a dent. But I tell you this, we did have the love of God in our souls to some extent, and we embraced all our brothers and sisters, and that made the difference. And many, many were open to prayer in our benediction, which was daily. Morning, noon, and night, we did pray.

If you wish to serve the world and to bring others into the love of God, pray with them. If you cannot pray with them, speak love as you would to a child, gently, encouraging.  And as things fall into place on your walk, and when it is obvious to all that you are in the flow of grace, you can exclaim, *“Ahhh, how wonderful! The angels have brought this to us. God has blessed us,”* and eventually, if not sooner, those who are witness to your walk begin to see it is real and the truth of God’s love is real. A real substance in your soul that has changed you, that has awakened you in a world of sleep. 

Sometimes when you are feeling the love of God in great abundance, the perceptions of your soul allow you to look out into the world and see it as if those in it are walking in a dream, some comfortable, others in a nightmare. And so you wish for them to awaken, to awaken in love. And especially God’s love, which is the great treasure awaiting every soul seeking truth, seeking life beyond death, seeking freedom. Allow this love to permeate your being. It is there for the asking, in any moment, in every situation. Be calm, allow the peace, the great peace to be yours.

I shall come again, and I thank my brother who was a bit dubious about taking my message, but he has done well, and I thank you all for allowing me to come to your wonderful soul circle of light. I shall step back in this prayer that we all may receive the great love of God.

With all my love and blessings, I am Barnabas, a redeemed soul and a disciple of the Master. We are one in Christ. God bless you.
