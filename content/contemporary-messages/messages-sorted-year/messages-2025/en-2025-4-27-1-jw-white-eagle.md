# One Tribe in God’s Love

White Eagle received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, White Eagle.

I am your brother and friend, and I come with God’s love. May the grace of the Great Spirit be upon you all.

In these troubled times, people look for safety, they look for protection, a loving place to land and to live in peace, and often, the reaction to inharmonious events is a type of tribalism. Not only tribes of native peoples, but you see, people will gravitate towards many types of groups. Some wholeheartedly towards their favorite sporting team, political party, their country, their musical preferences, and so forth, on and on. And of course, there is the desire to be in a community with like-minded souls and to feel protected. And so, people find themselves in these groups, in churches, in movements, and it gives them a real sense of belonging, of brotherhood and sisterhood within the human condition. Some groups are, of course, based on dogmatic beliefs. Some are open-minded. And some are very particular. Yet whatever your inclination, you have come here in this circle, in this tribe of Divine Love, to receive God’s love which embraces all. You have chosen well, and your hearts’ desires and your souls’ longings have led you here; from many cultures, many peoples, many countries; All one in this prayer.

No matter what culture or belief system you have come from, when you inject the spirit of God and the great love Divine into your community, into the world, you bring the essence of the Creator to many. For every soul is hungry for love, human and Divine. And those who have come into this circle for the great love of God realize that these blessings embrace all. As you let go of your concerns and you come into your souls and their longings, you find in the stillness there is grace, there is light, there is healing. And there are not many tribes, but one, all children of God.  You are, however, unique in the sense that you come together for the highest purpose, which results in transformation, being changed from the human condition to the Divine.

As you walk in the world and you wish to share, I remind you that everything you do in the love of God, every choice you make, is good and perfect. For no matter what you choose, when it is given in love, God smiles upon it, and we rejoice. With all my love and blessings and in the great love of God, I shall step back and join you in your prayer. May God bless us all, and His peace be with you.

I am White Eagle, your brother and friend in the celestial realms.
