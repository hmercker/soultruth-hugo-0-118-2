# A Special Dispensation of Healing

September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Jesus received by Al Fike

For this beautiful soul (Al) who serves me well, he has been given a special dispensation of healing, which you have helped to facilitate, a gift that shall indeed increase his life and give him health. It is my hope that he will have the wisdom and the strength to make the choices that will give him strength of the body, the mind and the spirit. For there is more to do or work that waits and there is such a need for instruments such as him.

I thank you, my brethren, for your efforts, for not only him, but his mate (Jeanne), for this is important to be in this unified circle of truth and light, to bring love to all, to give up your hearts to support one another, to walk in the world as a light. You are so needed, my brethren. You are so needed. I beseech you to walk in the light of truth, to act in the blessing of Love, to be God's channels and lights in the world. I will be with you as you walk, as you act. Know that I am with you and you are truly my brothers and sisters on the path of love.

May the Father continue to bless you, the mother continue to comfort you and all that is of God be yours, my brethren. I love you so and shall always and evermore be your brother and your friend. God bless you in His Love.
