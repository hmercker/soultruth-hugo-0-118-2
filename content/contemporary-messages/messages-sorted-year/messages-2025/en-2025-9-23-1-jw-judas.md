# May the Blessing of God's Love be in this Place and touch every Soul who enters

September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

England Retreat, Newquay, Cornwall, UK

Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother Judas.

I wish to acknowledge and honor this family open to the path of Divine Love and having committed themselves to service, allowing others to be blessed and reaping the great reward that comes with giving. You have created, as you call it, a bubble, and in this bubble, I ask you to create a holy place, a place of prayer, and to take on the practice of praying. You may wish to do this with words, externally or internally, or you may wish to simply open in faith, in trust, in knowing you are in a safe place in the asking to receive, in the allowing the blessing that is yours for this asking.

You have nothing to fear, you have nothing to lose, and you have the greatest gift to gain. Feel the showering of this love in this moment coming into your souls. There are many here, and we all support your prayers, and on a deeper level, we support the transition and transformation of your souls. There are expiations to come, and they may be intense, but as you let go of those things, as my brother has said, you have created, as he has, to protect your hearts from wounds from the slings and arrows that you have felt, bring your prayers to this place of safety.

Create a space for you and God and us in the celestial kingdom that we may visit you and be at one with you in this love. Your lives of service to others have created a clarity in this place. Now we ask you to step forward and bring a greater light, a greater love that all may be blessed who enter, for God will bless all those who come with open hearts and the longings of their souls.

The love we have for you is great. The love God has for you is beyond measure. You are worthy ever so. You are blessed evermore. We love you. May the blessing of Godâ€™s love be in this place and touch every soul who enters. This sanctuary will be as blessed as you allow. So, lastly, I say to you, allow God into this place. Make room for all in His love. God bless you. I am your brother and friend.

I am Judas, once of Kerioth, now a redeemed soul in the celestial heavens, and with you, one in Christ. I love you.
