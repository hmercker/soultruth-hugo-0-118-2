Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

My brothers and sisters, it is I, Judas.

May the love of God be upon you. In this timeless place where my soul dwells in the grace of God, I allow myself to be drawn in whenever needed and wherever needed. For I have not those boundaries that you have in your world. And of course, you have obligations and schedules, and these are helpful things. And yet when you have a moment outside of your paradigm, outside of your ideological constructs, your dogmatic beliefs, you find yourself in the freedom of now. For so many things that the human condition relies on are no more lasting than a house of cards blown away by the wind. And let that breeze be the Holy Spirit bringing the timeless gift of eternal love into your souls.

Step outside of your comfort zone, of your protective bubble, in faith, knowing that you are watched over by so many in love. Do you know it is our delight to see each one of you making your way towards the fountainhead of God’s love?  Each one, wherever they are on their journey, walking in faith, longing for more of the great gift, seeing how things in harmony with God’s will flow effortlessly. When you ask for guidance with your soul, it attracts the very thing you need, and this magnetism is the glue that draws all souls in oneness to the Father’s love. What a blessing to be free of time, to let go and allow God to touch your soul.

So many on Earth are looking for a hero, some superman, superwoman to bring all into peace and harmony, and yet you know that only God can bring that harmony upon the Earth through His children receiving the great gift of His love. That alignment is Supreme. That alignment is beyond the boundaries that you see before you. When brother Yogananda talks about the vastness of the universe, he is alluding to the lack of boundaries and to the freedom and openness of those souls living in the love of God.

My wish for each one is to take that leap of faith beyond your concerns, beyond your daily drama, your wish to figure it out, your wish for someone to save you, and move in to the Divine Grace that changes you, glorifies your soul, is without fear and full of joy and thanksgiving and praise for our heavenly Father.

May all your works be blessed, and please know you are supported, loved, and protected by so many and in the great embrace of God’s love. I am your brother and your friend, a redeemed soul in the celestial heavens, and I love you.

I am Judas. Go in Peace.
