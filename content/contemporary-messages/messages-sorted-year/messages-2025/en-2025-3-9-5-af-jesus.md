# Pleads With Us to Be Channels of Light in God's Service

March 9<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May God’s Love be with you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you this day, this day that you have set aside as a sacred dedication to your Heavenly Father, this day that is rife with possibilities and opportunities for each one of you to grow in Love, to be in the grace of God, to serve God in whatever way God has made possible in your life and to be a light. Being a light in your world is so important, for there is so much darkness and light disperses darkness. If you are a light shining forth through the mists and caverns of the human condition, then you are God’s servant to dissipate that darkness and bring light.

Beloveds, God needs you to be His servants and to be channels of light in the world, channels of love. God needs you to bring through His Will, to be an instrument for His Will, to answer prayers and to be angels on Earth. Are you willing to walk that road, beloveds, to be those beautiful lights, to be true to the Truth of Love?

My beloveds, God’s Love for you continues to feed you and uphold you. His angels continue to surround you and guide you. You are indeed on the threshold of great change in the world and great change within yourself. Be open to what God has to give and what God intends for this world. When you are in alignment with these things, then indeed you are God’s instruments. Indeed, you come to know with clarity, strength and grace God’s intentions for each one of you.

You are constantly upheld. God is sending His Love and blessings to you with every breath. There is little that you need, beloved souls, to continue on your journey of growth and development of the soul, awakening as the Love infills, ignites and cleanses. You are becoming brighter lights, beautiful channels of love. You draw me closer as your light grows. The Laws of Love pertain to our relationship, my closeness to you and your sense of my presence with you. Allow the great Love of God to clear away the haze of the mental conditions that you all carry, to ignite, clarify and bring into focus the faculties of the soul that perceive my presence, the presence of God and the presence of your angel friends.

As you grow in the Father’s Love and as you work diligently to disperse all conditions that restrict your vision, then we will know one another in the way that you long for, that we may be close, that I may speak to you and guide you, that I may bless you in such a way that you feel and know my presence and blessing. So it is with God, to be close to God, to be close to His Love, to be close to His Presence and the blessings thereon.

These things your soul longs for. These things come to you as you long and pray for them to be with you, these blessings from God, the Holy Spirit touching you and awakening you, the awareness that these manifestations of God are true, real and palpable and that you will feel them and know them beyond the shadow of a doubt. Allow yourself to be of faith and expectation. For in desire, as you open yourself and exercise your faith, then God’s Touch becomes real. God’s influence will carry you and bring you into greater light, beyond conditions of this world and into that which is truly of the spiritual.

My beloveds, you are precious to God, each one of you. God knows you, knows you better than you know yourself. God’s Love for you is beyond measure. Be in this grace always. With all the turmoil in your world, when you are in God’s grace, then these things do not touch you and do not inhibit you from being and feeling joy in your life. As that light, joy and love persist, so you may share this with others. Whether you share a truth, whether you share joy, whether you share love or whether you bring wisdom in counsel with another, all of these things come with the grace of God upon you. This gives you the empowerment that you need to truly touch another soul and to be heard.

My beloveds, there is much work to do. For, as is plainly evident, the world is in great turmoil and in need of comfort, peace and truth. Who will they turn to? Who is willing? Who here in this gathering is willing to comfort another, to embrace them in love and to show them the way to be uplifted out of darkness into light? If you are that person, then you are one of my disciples and you are one of God’s instruments. Be true to the calling of your heart and the knowings of your soul. In this, you will find your way along the avenues and byways of the human condition and experience as a light.

God needs you, beloveds. I need you to be that light and to travel those roads, to enter conditions that are disharmonious as God’s instrument, to neutralise and to bring light. There is much to do and few who are willing. Will you be those instruments, beloveds? I call you forth to serve the Hand of God, to be the channels of light and to be blessed fully in the resplendent Light of God’s Touch of Love.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come with love. I come to plead with you to be lights. I come to encourage you to be God’s instruments. The world will change by those who are willing to change and be transformed in Love. May God bless you in His Love, an abundant inflowing into your souls. May you feel the embrace of God, the upliftment and the joy of your communion with your Heavenly Father. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you always and evermore. God bless you.
