# Be Courageous in the Face of Your Challenges

April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Beams of Light, Christ Church, Barbados

Grace Jordan received by Maureen Cardoso

Dear gracious souls, I am Grace. It is a great pleasure to join you from the other side of the veil, to pray with you and to have this remarkable opportunity to come as a guide, a guide on the awakening of the soul, a guide on truth, a guide on awareness and a guide on love.

When you look at challenges, it can often stir within you a sense of being unsettled. More importantly, it can awaken in you resistance. I am here to encourage you to open your eyes to the opportunity of where you may not be in harmony with God's Laws. I put toward you to be strong and courageous, to look at what you consider to be a challenge as an opportunity for growth, an opportunity to see the truth and an opportunity to stand before your situation, looking potential fear directly in its face, and being willing to be shown, to be taught and to be guided as to how it is that such an experience is in your life.

The universe operates and is ordered by laws; nothing, I repeat, nothing comes to you, coincidentally. All things in your life, in one way or another, you have created and continue to create. Let that be a powerful knowledge and wisdom. Allow yourself to become humble, releasing arrogance and turning to God to ask what it is that is not in harmony. Ask how it is that you have created circumstances in your life, innocently or not, known or unknown. Ask God to guide you, to show you, to bring insight as to the correction that is possible to set you on a course of change.

We all know that change is not easy, but change is necessary. Change is necessary within yourself in order to become more aligned with the Laws of Love. That, dear ones, is a very positive and powerful piece of wisdom that I wish to share with you. Do not hide away from yourself. Do not shy away from the things that you can see within you that are uncomfortable. Your pain is a guide. You are in pain because you are outside of harmony, outside of the Laws of Love. Rather than justifying the things that you are doing, justifying them to yourself and to others, sit quietly. Sit with God in the lap of truth and have Him show you. Ask for the angels to be close and to walk with you through the path of change. In this way, you will find a great pace that increases in your progression, because you are no longer accumulating compensation from your actions and your thoughts.

You all know that this path is not for the faint hearted. It is for the strong and courageous. This is why you have chosen the path of truth, the path of awakening. You desire it within your souls. Allow God's Love to continue to awaken your soul, but you must align with truth - your own personal truth of what is happening within yourself. This is the only way you will grow, and lasting change will occur.

Open your souls, dear ones. Open your minds. Open your hearts. Hear the whispers and be attentive to that knowledge that is coming to you, for we are guiding you. We are responding with our love in truth. We do not judge you. Yet, there are times when it can be challenging to hear the truth of the matter in the circumstances you are experiencing.

May you all be mightily, mightily blessed in this time as you sit and grow in God's Love, where the Holy Spirit brings to you a mighty inflowing to soften you, to open you and to awaken you to the blessings of Love. I am Grace. God bless you all.

David J: Love you.
