The possibilities are limitless, my beloved friends. I am Orion. Humanity is a creative force on this world of yours. Indeed, the power of human creativity and action has brought about wonderful things and truly dreadful things. God gives every soul in the universe free will and many possibilities and potentials. Your intention together is to recreate yourself into something that is more in the image of God and that which is in harmony with God's creation than that which is in the image of man. It is a noble task indeed, one which many of us admire and are there to uphold you, so that your efforts, your continued progress and development may bring you into a strong alignment with what you are truly meant to be.

You are all unique creatures of God, but there are parameters that need to be acknowledged and lived by in order for these gifts you possess, the soul that is longing, aching for further growth and development in Divine Love, to continue on its trajectory toward greater light and harmony. Each of you knows this within your heart and soul. Each of you trusts in the journey, the path that you are taking with God. Each of you feels a sense of fulfillment, even joy, on this path. As you trust in God's guidance and God's Will, you will find yourself in situations and opportunities that you would not imagine. Indeed, to a degree, your faith is blind, your trust is blind, but not so much so that you feel as if there are no acknowledgements and sense of rightness of the road that you are on. There is always much more to accomplish, greater avenues to explore, more perceptions and revelations to experience and greater love to be had and expressed in your world.

As you continue on this great journey, are you not aware how blessed you are, how truly beautiful are your souls, how wonderful is God to have given you the opportunity to grow in the way of soul? Seek the alignment of your soul with God's Soul. Seek the alignment within you of all that you are, so that as you journey forth, there is greater love, harmony and peace. You will find yourself with greater joy and happiness and a firm understanding of the road you must take, a firm understanding of the gifts that God has given you and how they will be expressed, a deeper love for yourself, for God and for humanity. These are the blessings that God gives you with His Love. Indeed, as you find your way, as you realise your potentials and your abilities, as wisdom grows within you, as truth becomes truly a part of you, you cannot but grow and surge forward into greater light.

It is your destiny, my beloved friends. We are witnessing this destiny within each one of you, bringing us joy and a sense of purpose to assist you upon that journey. That assistance is great. So many crowd around you, my friends. So much light is given. So much light shines in your life. You will find great fulfillment in the efforts and endeavours that you make for God. For in this alignment with God's Will, the highest fulfillment of purpose, the greatest amount of joy and ecstatic acknowledgement, will come to you and truly be yours as you trudge upon this weary planet, so in need of what you have and what you are. You will give of yourself, and you will find your way in service. You will ignite the journey for others as God's instruments of love.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. We continue to journey together. Indeed, we do so in love and in joy. God bless you, my friends.
