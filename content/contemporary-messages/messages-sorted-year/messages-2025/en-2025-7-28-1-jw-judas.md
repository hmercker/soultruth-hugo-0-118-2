# What you choose draws Spirits unto you that are vibrating at the same level

Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother and friend. I am Judas.

I have spoken before about the necessity to be aware of what you send out and what you receive. I’ve called this being transmitters and receivers, and I think those are good words to describe a human being and their sensory awareness. I have also talked about making choices, environmental choices, entertainment choices, those whose company you keep, and what you take in. But today I should like to speak on spirit influence. There are many factors associated with what kind of spirits surround one, what kind of conditions spirits are drawn to, and what attractions cause spirits to come and be near. In the prayer for Divine Love that James Padgett received, there is the asking for protection from the lower ones, and it is said, “who so constantly surround you and endeavor to turn your thoughts to things of the world”. I will give you a recommendation. It is one thing to be aware of your thoughts, and of course, we wish that they are of a higher nature, informed by your soul and its desires for God’s love. And yet, feeling God’s love with the longings of the soul, feeling the presence of grace, that is something, not only magnificent, but something that one does not wish to ever find oneself separated from. For even those of you who live a life of prayer and are protected by your celestial friends, and in grace, fall back into the human condition. This is expected, while others find themselves in grief, in doubt, in unworthiness, in anger, in unforgiveness, in material desires, bodily desires, addictions, and the list goes on.

What you choose draws unto you those spirits who are living, or you may say vibrating, at the same level.  I give you an example. You are angry, and you seem almost out of control sometimes in that moment of anger, and if you allow it to continue, you draw in those spirits who are also angry, and it is like lighting a match to kindling. This is one example. What we recommend is that you be aware in your feelings of the condition, not only of your soul, but of your surroundings. Let us say someone is upset with you, and though they may be far away, you can perceive this, and it may be hurtful, it may cause you to despair, or just be saddened. What do you do? If you are feeling that from someone, pray for them. Send them love. Ask us to be with them, to heal them, to bless them. Ask the same for yourself, that you may be surrounded and protected in the bubble of God’s love. Think of it as a halo, surrounding you, protecting you.

My point is this: to not only be mindful of your choices, of your circumstance, but to be perceptive in your feelings. If you feel something is off, out of harmony, pray that the love of God come in and harmonize the situation and your soul and your mind and your body. Let your heart open, that what you send out creates an atmosphere, not only of peace, but a blessing of light, of love. Feel the love of God as your soul sends out its longings. Draw in your angels, your protectors, your guides. This is walking in faith. This is living in grace, and this will change your trajectory from horizontal to vertical on the path of love, Divine Love.

I hope this has been helpful, for I truly saw a need to speak of this, not only within this circle, but beyond. And as always, I thank my brother for being in condition, and he has received it well. With all my love and blessings, I am your brother in Christ and your eternal friend. I am Judas. God bless you.
