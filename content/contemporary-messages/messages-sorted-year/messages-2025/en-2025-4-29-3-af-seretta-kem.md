# Expresses His Happiness With Our Soul Progression

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I am pleased you have come together, beautiful brothers and sisters, in the Truth of Love. I am Seretta Kem and I come to tell you that because of the makeup of the individuals who are here, many of you are mediums as you well know, we are taking full advantage of this situation in order to assist you in the further development of your mediumistic gifts.

Indeed, how often do we have this opportunity to do so? How fortuitous it is to have the gifts and the conditions that will promote further growth and development in this regard. We are mixing chemicals. We are helping to share capacities and gifts amongst you in order to create a deeper capacity for rapport with us and for communication through many of you. Indeed, as it has been indicated, your coming together as you are today was not something that was through happenstance. It was planned and a great deal of development is taking place as you are together in this group, this beautiful Circle of Light.

Allow yourself to feel, to relax into this condition that is quite unique and quite powerful. Open your souls wide, my friends, as you continue to seek out your relationship with God. For without this strong relationship and the great blessings that come from it to your soul, we cannot work well with each of you. As a result of the blessings of God’s Love within your soul, that light that shines from your soul, we are able to work well and freely amongst you and develop you further and deeper in your gifts, not just in the gifts of mediumship, but also in the gifts of perception, insight, intuition and wisdom of the soul. All of these things you require and are in great need of as you venture out into the world.

Each individual here will receive great blessings, and each individual here will help facilitate great blessings for others. The unique makeup of each individual, each beautiful soul here and the gifts that reside within can be well utilised for the benefit of others in this group. We are elevating you to a beautiful condition of light where you may release yourself into the peace and the beautiful love that exists as you pray together, are in rapport with one another and in rapport with the angels that surround you, creating a sort of bliss, a beautiful light and peace that envelops you.

We are here close and we are very happy that we have this opportunity. When these days are finished, in your prayers together you will feel changed. The gifts that you have will be enhanced and deepened. You will know a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that you have progressed further along this path in the way of service, in the way of expression of your gifts and in the way of deeper insights and greater joy. This is God’s blessing to you, each one a gift given, a beautiful blessing. We are with you, my beloveds, beautiful friends. We shall persist with you every moment, for each moment that you are together in this place is a precious one, is a gift from God and has much potential and many blessings to flow.

God bless you, my friends. I am Seretta Kem. I am happy to work with you in these ways of which I have described. God bless you all. My love is with you. God bless you.
