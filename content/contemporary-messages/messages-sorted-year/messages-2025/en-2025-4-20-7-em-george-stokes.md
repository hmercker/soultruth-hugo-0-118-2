# A Developing Spirit's Lesson

April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Beams of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

**Developing Spirit:** Let go of accumulation of material objects, but pray deeply to come to know your purpose in this life on the Earth. Your travels through the spirit world will occur much more quickly and beautifully.

**George:** I am here now. I am George. I allowed this soul to come and speak, for he has the wisdom that can benefit all of you who are here and who seek the Truth of God’s Love and God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. Remember, Jesus has said, *“Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and all else will come unto you.”* This is what this dear soul has and is learning.

I am George, your brother. I thank you for listening.
