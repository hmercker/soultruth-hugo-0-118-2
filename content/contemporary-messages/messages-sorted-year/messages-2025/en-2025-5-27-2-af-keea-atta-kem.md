Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

May this Love be yours, dear precious souls who are seeking truth and are seeking the highest blessing from God. I am Keea atta Kem. I come to speak about light, how important it is to be a light and to express light in the world. For when you are able to be a light in the world, you become God's agent to disperse the darkness.

Light comes in many ways, through many channels and many instruments in the world. God will engage every and all who are willing to be a light. It matters not their beliefs, their religion or their understanding of the mind. What matters is the power of their own soul in alignment with God and in alignment with all that which is of light. For when light is present in the individual, then that which is of truth will come into awareness and be adopted by those individuals. The wisdom of the soul knows and discerns the difference between error and that which is truth.

When truth is acknowledged, then light is maintained. When love is expressed, whether that be of the natural love or the Divine Love, then light is sustained. When each individual entertains thoughts that are of light, positive, refreshing, encouraging and uplifting thoughts, this brings light to the individual and light through the individual. When you express your own desires of the soul combined with God's desires to utilise you as an instrument, when this combination is in harmony and in alignment, then there is great light. When you are a channel of love in the world, there is the most pure light, the highest Light. When God's Love is expressed through the soul into the world, then that Light cannot be extinguished. It burns bright and it draws the lost souls close, whether they be in the spirit world or the material world. That Law of Attraction brings them, for they seek to be loved. They seek relief. They seek peace and each of you may be an instrument to bring this to many others.

There are so many ways to bring light to the world. As you grow within your soul, as your soul strengthens and becomes in harmony and in alignment with God, then the light grows, the harmony grows and all that you are and all that you do in the world is expressed in light. My beloveds, bringing light to you is not difficult. It requires a choice to be a light and to understand what being a light truly is. Each of you has been taught the lessons of light. Each of you brings your own light. When you are God's instruments, you bring certain shades of light, beautiful light into the world, sometimes as an instrument for healing, sometimes an instrument for peace and sometimes an instrument for truth. Yet, at all times, love infuses these instrumentalities and you bring a gift, a beautiful blessing to the world and to all you meet.

Pray to be a light, beloved souls. Pray to be used as God's instruments and surely light will abound through you and around you, and you will feel the upliftment and the joy and the peace that comes as light is yours and you are light. My beloved, beautiful children of God, each of you carries the light and I beseech you all to be that light. Do not hide away. Do not doubt yourself, but be that light as you move in the world. The world will respond with harmony, peace and all that is good.

Beloved souls, I am Keea atta Kem. My love for you is great. I want to encourage greater light within you. Seek out God's blessings and that light shall surely be yours, as God's Hand is upon you, light flows and light is a gift given. God bless you. My love is with you all. God bless you, dear children of light.
