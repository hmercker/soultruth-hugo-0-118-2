Faith Nyquist & Jesus received by Al Fike

**Faith:** God bless you, my friends. I am Faith. I come to talk to you about your instrumentality, how you forge the chain of love for your brothers and sisters in all the things that you may do to serve God.

I ask you, my brethren, to seek out those ways to uphold your brothers and sisters, to uphold light in your world. There is much need in your world. There are many who cry out, who are lost and afraid. Some are hungry. Some are confused. Many are angry. Many do not know God nor feel a kinship with one another. The darkness prevails, my beloveds. It is a crisis of darkness, a terrible condition that you, in your ways and means, prayers and desires, are looking to counteract and to bring light into your lives and light into the lives of others. You are so very needed, my beloved brothers and sisters, for God needs all those who are willing to replace darkness with light, to replace pain with joy, to replace anger and isolation with love and to replace ignorance with wakefulness and truth.

You, my beloved friends, are upon that path of light and truth. You seek it on the highest road, the road that brings to you the great Love of God into your souls. In this way, any darkness within you is expelled and replaced by Love. You must continue on this road with fervency, dedication and strength, that you may truly be a purified soul on your way to the Celestial Kingdom. As you make that journey, God will utilise the resources that you have made available through your desires, prayers and efforts to be a light, so that God may use you as His instruments, channels of light in the world, ensuring that that chain of light will not be broken, ensuring that you will sustain the truth within you and around you. It is our hope and God's desire that you will share this truth with any soul who is willing to listen.

Be that stalwart missionary of truth. Be that light in the world. It is not difficult when you follow the truths that you have been taught and practise, the prayers and desires of the soul toward God. All of these things bring a light to you. All of these things bring a great blessing through you to many others. It would not take that many to change the world, if those individuals are stalwart and dedicated and truly in alignment with God. Jesus and his followers changed the world to an extent that you still know of him and his mission of love. How many are here? How many can say, “I am truly a follower and disciple of the Master, of the Truth of Divine Love,” which our beloved Jesus taught? If you can say this with all your heart and be an instrument of God with all your desire and willingness, knowing His Will in your life, then you are an agent of change in the world. You are one who might serve God and serve humanity.

Make this your daily effort, beloved souls. Go out into the world. Shine your light and be that beautiful beacon of peace, truth and love. If you can do this with the integrity and commitment and love that is required, then you will contribute to changing the world. God will ensure that you are guided and placed, with each day, upon the path of service, upon the path that will touch souls deeply, upon the path that displays and is an example of God's Love at work, beautiful blessings given to you, to your families, to all you meet. Being an instrument of God is of the highest order and the highest outcomes.

Seek to be that instrument. Pray for this. Pray fervently. Pray with great faith and you will be the light in the world.

**Jesus:** I come to affirm the truths that our daughter has given. To be my disciple, God's instrument, channel of love, is the highest of callings. I urge you, my beloveds, to listen to that calling of your soul, for your soul desires this deeply and you must make this a conscious and willing desire within your being and life. My beloveds, go forth and be called by God to be His instruments in the world. I will be with you, each one, as you answer that call.

I am Jesus and I love you. I am with you, as you know, and shall be forevermore your true friend and brother. I love you. I love you dearly, beloved lights, beautiful channels of love. God bless you. God bless you all.
