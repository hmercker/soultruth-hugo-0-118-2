Augustine received by Al Fike

The world benefits from your prayers, beloved and beautiful students of truth. I am your teacher, Augustine.

Your prayers have power. Your prayers have purpose. Your prayers are required, that this world may indeed be uplifted in light. For how many prayers are spoken that go directly to God? There are a number, of course, but are they so focused, so effective, that they change the conditions of this world to a degree that brings healing and peace to many? As you pray together in this purposeful way, as you seek to be uplifted in light, as you seek the great Truth that is the blessings of Divine Love from our Heavenly Father, then you sustain the Light of God’s Truth in the world. You sustain the conditions required for we from the Celestial Heavens to enter into this world.

Yes, we have many abilities, gifts of the soul, powers to heal and to bring harmony to the world, but we cannot come close without souls such as yourselves in prayer and desire to serve and to be in alignment with God’s Love. We may see from afar. We may respond to individual souls who are seeking light, but when your desires and your prayers are so focused on truth, are so sincere and effective, then our capacity to serve humanity has been greatly enhanced by your prayers. When you come together in this way, remember that you not only pray for yourselves, but you pray for the world. You pray for those you love. You pray for those in need and those who are your brothers and sisters upon this path. You pray for many things, many blessings from God. They come, my beloved and beautiful students, in accordance to the intensity and desires of your soul.

Be in alignment with God always, beloved and beautiful souls. Be in alignment with truth. Seek to serve with humility and grace. Seek to be a light and God will utilise you in ways and means that you could not possibly know or see. I wish to assure you that you are effective instruments of the Father, effective instruments for light, beautiful channels of love. I urge you to continue to come together in this way. For the world needs you desperately and there is so much need, so many who are lost, who are heartsick, who desire relief from their pain, so many who do not see the way forward and are crushed by the darkness. You see, your efforts and your prayers are important and necessary.

My beautiful, beautiful students, seek to be God’s instruments, humble and gracious, beautiful and loving, without judgement, without fear, without all conditions that are part of the human condition. Rather, be a part of God’s condition, God’s blessings for the world. You will find that God will utilise you greatly, even when you are not in prayer. We are close and we utilise you in many ways. You walk in light. You are a light and so the blessings will flow in accordance to your light.

God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you within the peace that passes all understanding, open you to the great inflowing of His Love, use you as His humble servants in the world. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come in love and appreciation of your beautiful works, your beautiful instrumentalities to bring light to the world. God bless you all. God bless you in Love. Augustine loves you.
