# We Are All Children of God and His Love is Available to All

September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Harrow Retreat, Harrow, UK

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved children, I come. I am Jesus. I come to be with you in prayer. I am not the Jesus that many portray me to be. I am the Jesus that was and still is my Father's beloved son. As you are all His children, I am His child. As you are all loved by God, I am loved by God. This is the message that I came to speak of so many years ago and continue to speak of to this day.

The power of Love is the healing agent, the bonding agent, the way toward at-onement with God. God’s Essence is available to all children, all who ask, no matter their religion, their perspective, or the state of their lives. If they ask in sincere prayer to receive the gift of God’s Essence, they will receive. It is a law, my brothers and sisters, that in prayer, if you ask with sincerity and desire, it is given. It is for you to understand that the desires of the soul to be with God are very real within each one of you and all of humanity.

Yet, few recognise this. Few acknowledge it. Many desire many things. They seek out truth in many ways, but the truth of the soul is something that comes and flourishes in your relationship with your Creator. When your prayers are sincere, your desires clear, your words and your feelings and all that is deep within you, true and purposeful, are laid at the feet of God, then you will come to know your Creator as your Heavenly Father, as that beautiful and glorious soul that is God. You will come to know how much God loves you. You will come to love God.

This is not a religion. It is a truth. It is a practice of prayer. This is what I taught. Its simplicity eludes many, but it is indeed the way to at-onement with God. My beloveds, as I have said, seek ye the Kingdom and all things shall fall and come to you. Thus, it is when you seek this one gift, all other gifts come with it. All healing and purifications, awakenings and understandings come as this Love ignites the soul, awakens the soul and transforms the soul.

Be with God, my beloveds, within your soul. Know that it rejoices when there is that true communion with your Creator. Be with God now, my beloveds. Each of you has an angel by your side, praying with you. Ask that your soul opens, the consciousness of soul is ignited by the consciousness of God and you will find your way upon a path resplendent in gifts, blessings, experiences and awakenings. All is given in love and all is given without restriction. It is given because God loves each one of you and desires that each one of you may come to know your true selves, to be awakened to that place deep within that seeks to know the light, that seeks to know love. It is within all of you, my beloveds. Seek it out. Seek it out and know that God has created within you a treasure trove of gifts, experiences, connections and blessings.

It awaits you, my beloveds. It awaits all of you and all of humanity. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and the door shall be opened. God bless you upon the Path Divine. May you awaken to all its wonders. I am your brother and your friend. I am Jesus and my love is with you all. God bless you.
