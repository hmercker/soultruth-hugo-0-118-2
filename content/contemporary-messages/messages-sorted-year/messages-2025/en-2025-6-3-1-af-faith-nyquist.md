# Ask to Be of Service

June 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Faith Nyquist received by Al Fike

â€¦ children of God, may you find your way into greater light, your souls awakened to greater love. I am Faith. I come to speak to you about sharing your love, opening yourself up to God's desire and intention to use you as a channel of love in the world. When you do not put obstructions in the way of this, God will provide for you and inspire you toward many opportunities and many invitations to be a light in the world. That invitation may be something as simple as reaching out to a stranger, or a neighbour, or another who is in need of upliftment and love. When you are in the right place at the right time, God will infuse you with love and ensure that theyl will receive the blessings that they are open to.

It may be more involved than that. Possibly, you find yourself speaking to a crowd, of being an instrument in a way that touches many souls at once. That too is part of God's intention and design upon your instrumentality to be a light in the world. You could be used in many, many different ways, in many different situations. The key is to pray to be used as God's instrument of light and love. When you set your intention for that day to be used as a light, oh, how you will see that God will inspire, guide and show you the way toward circumstances and situations that you could not even dream of.

Yet, you must have the desire, my friends. You must be in alignment with God. When that alignment takes place, then you will see the path ahead of you. The footsteps are easily taken. The direction is clear. God will guide you upon a path of service and show you the way through utilising your gifts, your talents and your being to be that instrument of light, unique as it is. When you glow in the light, when you desire to be a channel of light and love, oh, how your personality and your being steps forth in ways that draw others to you. This is not a difficult task or condition that God wishes of you. It is in the flow of His love and therefore all is in harmony. All is in His grace, His blessings.

Do not allow negative forces to obstruct the opportunities that God puts before you. Do not even entertain in your thoughts that there are obstructions. When I walked upon the Earth, I moved in faith. I asked to be used as an instrument. Each day, God guided me to what I was meant to do. With surety and a desire to serve God and serve humanity, that day was a day of service, a day that touched others, a day that uplifted, a day that utilised my gifts in the world. I come to you, my brothers and sisters, to do the same. Do not allow your reticence, your shyness, your skepticism, or any other condition within you that might hold you back from serving God and reaching out to others, do not let these things obstruct the passage of blessings through you from God. For when you are in alignment, indeed the blessings flow, and you know and feel how powerful, how beautiful, how joyful is this service in love.

Be within the grace of God, my friends. Do not allow anything to hold you back. The greatest impediments lie within each one of you, for there is fear, fear of hurt, fear of rejection, fear of doing things wrong. Yet, these are only things that you have made up within your mind to hold you back from what your soul knows is true service. Pray to be used, my friends. Have great faith and walk in the world with your head held high, your heart open and attunement with God always. My beloved friends, each of you is a light. Each of you is unique. God can utilise each one of you in ways of light, in unique opportunities and expressions that are in harmony with who you are, the beautiful light that you are. Be true to yourself, be true to God's Will and all else will fall into place. There are no worries when you work for God. There is only the satisfaction and the joy that comes with your efforts in alignment with God's Will.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Faith. I love you so. Beautiful, beautiful lights, shine forth in the world. The world will benefit greatly from your efforts, for God is using you and God will bless you as you are being used. All my love to you, beloveds. I am Faith and I love you. God bless you.
