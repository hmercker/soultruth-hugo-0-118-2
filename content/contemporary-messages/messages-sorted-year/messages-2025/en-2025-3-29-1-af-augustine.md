# Your Struggles are Not in Vain

March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Yes, there is progress, dear souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. Though you see your progress as slow, arduous, tedious even, we see it as swift and reaching its mark quickly. Though you see that you have little to show for your progress, because your mind has its parameters and ideas of what that would be, our way of marking your progress is looking within your soul, seeing the light there growing and seeing its effects as it cleanses and purifies.

As long as you are guided by the mind and its expectations, you will mark your progress as slow and of little consequence. For the mind is the last thing to capitulate to the progression of your soul. It is the one thing that holds fast in its perspective and its expression in your daily life. Since you live in a world that is of mind, then indeed you follow the current of that expectation and expression. Yet, you are seeking something different, even revolutionary, in its expression and in its priorities. Thus, you are reluctant to follow the desires of your soul as consistently as you do with your mind, because you see that these inclinations, inspirations and desires are often contrary to the expectations of the material world.

The struggle continues, my friends, beyond those conditions that are brewing and growing within your soul, seeking to dominate your consciousness and seeking its true expression and way of being in the world. You find yourself on the horns of a dilemma, as the contradictory occurrence of thought continues to collide, as you continue to struggle and as you continue to feel unease because all is not in unison and in harmony together. My beloved and beautiful students of truth, you study often. You read. You pray. You exert your will. You pray some more. You continue to try to climb those stairs of enlightenment, but your feet are leaden by your mindful concerns and fears.

It is a struggle. It requires great effort. It requires faith, my friends, deep faith. You struggle often upon a road that does not seem clear or even justifiable by the mind. Yet, in your heart, you know you are on the right road. You continue to seek the truth, and the truth resonates within the depth of your being. In that resonance, it holds its place and its expression within you. There are times when that expression is clear and resonant as a bell chiming in its beautiful tones. At other times, it is muted. Other times it is lost altogether.

Yes, the conditions upon your plane, your Earth, continue to have their influence upon you and upon everybody. Yet, you know within your heart that God is with you, that your angel friends are with you, your stellar friends, the bright spirits, all this beautiful influence and all this beautiful reinforcement of truth continues to live within your being and often within your consciousness. Continue the struggle, my beautiful students. Continue to be brave, steadfast, filled with faith brimming within your consciousness, filled with trust in God and trust within your deeper selves. In time, the dominance of the mind will capitulate and be absorbed by the consciousness of the soul. That will be a time of true celebration and true being within the Divine Love reality, the reality of God.

We look forward to that day. In the meantime, we are here for you. We love you dearly. We uphold you every minute of every day. We pray for you constantly. We are your guardians and your teachers, your healers and your friends. We shall remain steadfast, my beloved, beloved students, always and evermore. For one does not walk this path alone. One is accompanied by angels. One has the strength offered, the inspiration and the love and this is a great, great gift and blessing to you all.

Shall we continue, my beloved friends? Shall we place one foot upon the Path Divine, followed by another and another, until that realisation, that expansion, that integration that is the soul becoming enlivened by the Love of God, the Essence of our Creator's great Soul, until there is no room for doubt, there is no room for error and there is no room for this duality that continues in your consciousness. There is only room for love. Love shall reign supreme within you and shall be expressed with every breath, every action and every thought. It shall come and be without any stirrings that are dark or without truth. You are God's children. Yes, we see the light within. We see the stirrings. We see the growth and expansion of the Love that grows within you. You are truly on the path, beloveds. Truly. We are with you as you grow and come to that place of true transformation and integration of this gift given by God so freely.

God bless you, my beloveds, my beautiful students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I have come to encourage you, to acknowledge you and to love you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
