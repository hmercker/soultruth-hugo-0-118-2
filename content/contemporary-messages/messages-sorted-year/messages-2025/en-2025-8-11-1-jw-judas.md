# Serve All in the Divine Love and the Natural Love and Help each other in the Community

Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

Brothers and sisters may the love of God be upon us. I am here, Judas.

There is much to be said about healing, which is a form of service, both on earth and in the spirit world. If you examine the work of the Master while on earth, you can plainly see a life of service, of healing, of drawing those who hungered for the truth of the great love he possessed. And in the midst of turbulent times and great enmity between many of us and the yoke of Roman rule, many of us wishing, of course, to overthrow that and create a Jewish state, the Master did not encourage this, but rather that we should love our enemies. And while we fed the hungry and the sick were healed, he reminded us and those whose care we were in, *‘whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers and sisters you do for me.’*

There was great balance in the Master between the natural love and service to humankind in earthly ways, as well as always pointing to God, always bringing it around to the great metamorphosis that occurs when a soul is born again in the love of the Father. These things have not changed in all these centuries. So much turbulence, violence, hunger, homelessness, and so much longing to become at one, somehow, some way with God.

We encourage constantly for one to pray, for one to serve, and for one to seek justice in peaceful ways. These things make a difference. One does not have to become famous to affect the world, but one does need to live in love, and in the case of all here and those who may hear this message beyond this circle, to seek transformation in the great love of God while serving the world as you walk through it.

So, you may wish to consider, as a community, not only an outreach in what is most important, of course, prayer, but also in service, feeding the hungry, finding shelter for the homeless, and taking in refugees of all kinds. And of course, one who finds oneself in a situation needing help. I will give you an example. You run out of gas on the highway, and someone comes along who has some gas and helps you. You’re not really wondering what is their religion? What is their politics? What is their race? What country are they from? What is their gender? What is their sexual orientation? Are they rich or poor? No. You are just grateful.

So, finally, I say to you, love all in the love of God. Serve all in the Divine and the natural love and help each other in community. A powerful force you are in this world, though you may not know it. We are with you. We are protecting you. And God is sustaining you in His great love.

I thank you. I am your brother in Christ, once of Kerioth, now a redeemed soul in the celestial heavens, and yes, your eternal friend. May God bless you and may you be of good cheer in His love. I am Judas.
