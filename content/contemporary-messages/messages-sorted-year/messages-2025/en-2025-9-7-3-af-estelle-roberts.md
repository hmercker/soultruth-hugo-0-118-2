Estelle Roberts received by Al Fike

I am Estelle Roberts. I come to speak of this church that I love so dearly. It is on the verge of a revitalisation, a great change and will become a sanctuary for many. I urge you to prepare for this, to be in alignment in your thoughts and your desires, that this may happen and become truly a sanctuary of light, that God's blessings may flow into this place and bring peace.

There are so many who are desperate out there in the world, so many who are lost, but because you dear souls have dedicated your life to bring greater light to yourself and to this place, you will draw in those who are lost and desperate. You will draw in those who are curious and lonely. Just as we did in our day, you will do in your day, my friends. Do not underestimate the plan that God has to help humanity. It is a wide and sweeping plan that will touch many souls. You are part of that plan and part of that effort.

Do not see your spiritual life as that which is for yourself only. God has given you much so that you may share, that you may share love, truth, healing and peace. See yourselves as God's instruments. For when you look at your service in this way, then you will find that much will flow through you. Guidance will come and inspiration will come. Indeed, people will come to share in the peace and sanctuary of this place. You have been given the gift of a portal of light. You have been given the gift of many angels to help you in this service, but most of all, you have found the key to true service and true love.

I urge you to utilise this truth that you have found so that you may be blessed deeply, but others may be blessed as well through you. The blessing of this simple teaching may uphold and uplift all those who enter into the doors of this sanctuary of light. I am very happy to see what has transpired in these days. Many blessings have come. Our beloved Master Jesus has come. Many other spirits and angels have come. There is still much work to do, my friends, but you are doing it and you will continue to do it. Life will change for you. The restrictions and inhibitions that often come with earthly life will be removed and there will be clarity and great ability to serve your brothers and sisters.

Be humble in your service. Be true to your path and love above all. Love everyone who comes through that door. In doing so, you will draw to you from the spirit world the highest of spirits and angels to do God's bidding, to bring peace and blessings to all who are here. If you feel this in your heart, you know that I speak to you. If you know this with every ounce of your being, then do not shirk from your responsibilities and invitations that have been given. Be true to your soul's desire to serve and to be in light and you will have a fulfilling and joyful life, my friends. Just as I had, so you will have. Just as I drew many, so you will draw many.

It is not that difficult when you engage your heavenly Father in the work, when you are faithful and humble, kind and generous, filled with inspiration, expressing your gifts freely, giving of what you have to give without restriction or fear or inhibition. God needs all of you to be a light in the world. I urge you to express that light with each and every day that comes, to be truly in alignment with God's Will. All will flow in accordance to plan. All will come in blessings, in accordance to your desire to serve and the needs and desires of those who sit to listen, to find truth. This awaits you, my friends. It is coming. You will see from this day forward, more will stream in through those doors, more and more until there is no capacity left to house the hungry and the needy, the seekers and the lights.

God bless you, my friends. I am Estelle Roberts. I love you all. I am very pleased to see you here. Spread the word that there are blessings to be had within this place. Do not restrict it to mere messages of comfort, although they are important, but add deeper spirituality and teachings as you progress along with this church. Blessings to you, my friends. May you be kept in the light, protected, guided and loved. God bless you. I love you. God bless you.
