# Prepare Yourselves for this Time Together

January 11<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Grace Jordan received by Al Fike

May God's Love be upon you. I am your sister, Grace. We have much work to do, my friends, much work indeed. As you gather and do so consistently, with the right frame of mind and attitude, then we can accomplish much together. There is so much that needs to be accomplished. In these precious times when you set aside your day for prayer and for development of the soul, it is important that you see this time as a gift and a blessing.

My beloved friends, there is no time to waste and there is much to do. It is important that you align yourself with God in a greater way, in a way that will open the floodgates, the doors of His Love and open the way for His angels to minister to you, to help you in your perceptions, in your spiritual condition, in your mindful condition and, of course, in your soulful condition. But these things are always reliant upon your attitude and desire. If your mind is elsewhere, if your thoughts continue to draw you beyond this framework of light, then we cannot do what we wish to do. Yes, there will be some blessing and some benefit, but it is important to be focused, faithful and enthusiastic about what we wish to do.

The highest outcome requires the highest attitude, the highest thoughts, the highest desires and those things come from the soul. So, I urge you to listen, my beloved brothers and sisters. I urge you to listen and to be in that alignment with God. When you are in that alignment, then the flow is mighty, and the blessings are great. When your feelings and desires are lukewarm, then this reflects what is given. There is so much in your world that will draw you away and that will be a distraction. I ask you with all humility to put the material aside for these days to come and be in alignment with the Will of God. The beauty of His blessings for you which wait, they accumulate and the pressure to flow toward you is great. But they await your acceptance and receptivity and when that comes, then the floodgates are open, and the flow is great.

Do you not wish this for yourselves, my beautiful friends? Do you not wish this? For God does. God wants you to have everything. God wants you to feel, know and experience everything He wishes to give in His Love, the abundance, the fruitful blessings, the peace that passes all understanding, the Love that flows unimpeded and powerfully to you. Be God's children in the innocence of children. Know God's grace in the flow of His Love and be uplifted. For if you are attuned in these days to come, you will be walking on air, filled with His Love and grace, filled with joy and peace, filled with the excitement of the soul, knowing that it has found its Maker and is truly in the grace of our beloved Creator.

The choice is yours, my friends. The choice is always yours. When you come to the gates of Heaven with penitent desire, with humility, with the urgings of your soul, then all the goodness, all the light will pour upon you, the angels shall surround you and even the beloved Master shall be with you in this glorious time that has been arranged and that is waiting for your presence fully a part of what is meant to be.

Be true to your soul's desires, beloved and beautiful children of God. In this, all that is, all that will be, will be yours. God does not hold back His blessings. Only you, beloved souls, hold yourselves from them. I urge you to put aside all restrictions, all distractions and fully be in the grace of God. In this way, we will travel a great distance together, you and us, walking in this light, receiving the blessings, the Truth and the way that is of God and His Love.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Grace. I too stand with you and wish for you and all who are coming to be in that light, to know the joy of it, the wonderment of it and all the blessings of it. God bless you. God bless you all. What is meant to be shall be, my friends. If you are a part fully of what this is, it shall be yours and change you forever. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.
