# Opens Starpoint Retreat

January 25<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Starpoint Retreat, Christ Church, Barbados

Augustine received by Al Fike

May God touch your soul deeply and profoundly. I am Augustine, once the Bishop of Hippo, but now I come to you as an Angel of the Celestial Heavens. I have progressed beyond the limitations of that time on Earth so many years ago. I come now to serve God, to bring the good news of the bestowal of His Love, a gift to humanity that they may avail themselves of this extraordinary blessing and come to know it for their own.

Beloved children of the Earth, you have your challenges. You have conditions around you that are not of God, but of human creation. Yet, something within you brought you to this place, this time, curious, desirous of something that might enhance your life and change your quality of life to a degree that you understand beyond the superficial and beyond the machinations of the mind.

I did not truly understand these things when I walked the Earth. But, shortly after entering the world of spirit, I began to search the ways and means that I might be closer to God. Many helped me to find that way. Many spirits, beautiful spirits, helped me. Today, around you, arrayed with each one, are many beautiful spirits, Celestial Angels, for they are eager to help the people of Earth, eager to disperse the darkness, the loneliness, the isolation and the untruth that exists in your world.

It is our intention and desire to bring the Truth of God back to the hearts of men, back to that place where it enters and becomes a warm glow, a sense that everyone is not alone, a sense that God is with you. Whether you understand the needs of your soul or not, I suggest that each one of you is yearning for God within that soul. So, you seek, haphazardly, to answer that yearning within. You go here and you go there. You wonder. Yet often you do not find what you are looking for.

Today, we offer you a solution to this yearning, an antidote to your pain, a blessing that will transform everything within you, from that which is disharmonious and not of God's creation to that which is of God's creation, that which brings harmony. Whether you accept and embrace this Truth that has been shared, this experience that has been proffered to you, is entirely of your doing and desire. God will not force anything upon you, beloved souls. God merely offers, generously and abundantly, in Love, not judging you in any way, but loving you in ways, depths and breadths that, when you come alive in your awareness of God, you will truly be humbled by the extent to which God loves you.

Each one of you, each child of God, everyone upon the earthly plane, you are loved. This is a resource, a blessing, an energy, if you will, that you may take advantage of, that you may bring within your heart and soul, and it will uplift you. It will carry you through all conditions that you may encounter. It will bring to your joy, deep and abundant joy. It will help you to understand your own self, that true self, which is the soul. It will help you to understand what life is, its purpose and meaning.

It will bring you truth, truth that is abundant, clear and simple, yet profound. Truth that you may utilise in your life to make it better, to make it beautiful and to make it true to what you are meant to experience in life. It is for you to discover these things. We come to you today in hopes that you will open yourselves, open your mind, open your spirit, open your soul, to take in what may be given and is given in accordance with your desires.

May you be blessed, beautiful souls. I am Augustine and I am pleased to be with you today to speak of the Truth that brought me to the gates of Heaven, that brought me to the understanding of truth and that brought me to great joy, unlimited joy. For God gives all these things to those who seek and those who are willing to step forward, beyond the limitations of their biases and understandings of the material mind, toward those expansive experiences, expressions and knowing of the soul.

God bless you, beloved souls of God. May we continue in prayer and contemplation, in desire and in love. God bless you. God bless you.
