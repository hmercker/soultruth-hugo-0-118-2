# Prays With Us to Bring Greater Light to the World

January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Ann Rollins received by Al Fike

May the Fatherâ€™s Love continue to infill your souls. I am Ann Rollins, and I come to encourage you in prayer. Indeed, every time you pray, you bring greater light to yourself and greater light to this world of yours. Think of the billions upon your planet and in the lower earthly plane who are not praying. They do not consider that prayer is a benefit, and they do not understand how to pray.

You are important. You bring a light, for the vast efforts of humanity do not bring light but often a greyness, a darkness that is out of harmony with God's Laws of Love and Creation. Your Earth is a dark place, a place in need of light. You have found a way, the way and means of bringing light. You feel it within your heart and soul, the power of that light, the power of God's Love infilling you and burning bright within you. The importance of this is very great indeed, for the world, as I say, needs light. The world, to know harmony, to thrive and to be in the grace that life is meant to be, needs light.

So, I encourage you to bring light, to think of light all around you. Every moment, you must be a light. You must be a channel of love as well, for God wishes to use you as that channel of love. You are inspired to do things that bring greater light and blessings to others. There is so much in this responsibility that you carry. It is not that you are more responsible than another, but because you know the truth, because you know the way of light, you are responsible for bringing that into the world and reinforcing light in the world. How do you do this? In all the beautiful ways that you express yourself, in all the beautiful prayers that you send forth to God and the beautiful light of your soul ever expanding and growing in Love. These are the ways that you must sustain, and you are responsible to do so because you know the truth and you are living the truth.

So, we are with God in these moments, bringing greater light. Together, you are a great channel of light. Together, that light is used to bless many others, many of whom you are not aware of and many whom you are. But indeed, as this Lattice of Light continues to grow and you continue to help strengthen and brighten this lattice, so many are affected by your prayers. For each one who prays and is a part of this great lattice is empowering that lattice in light, love and blessings, so that others who are not praying in this moment may benefit. When you are not praying, you may benefit, as around the world, these beautiful souls who are contributing continue to add to the glory of this structure, this blessing from God.

My beloved friends, it is so important to put God first, to put the welfare of your soul first. In this way, all other things, including the blessing of light, will come and will come in greater abundance, as you know, feel and receive the great gift of His Love. I encourage you, my beloved and beautiful friends, to be a light, to truly be a light in the world. For this is the most beneficial service you can provide for humanity, because the darkness reigns supreme in your world. Yet, the light continues to penetrate in pockets here and there. As more subscribe to light, the places where light exists will intensify and, in time, the world will be converted and transformed from darkness to light. Play your part, beloved souls, and you will be greatly rewarded for your efforts, for the blessings that you carry. You are God's emissaries, channels for light.

God bless you. I am Ann Rollins. I am happy to speak to you today. Beloved souls of light, carry on in your efforts and we will be with you. For light draws light. The Law of Attraction is always working and, in this case, a great benefit to you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
