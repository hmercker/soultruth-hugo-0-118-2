# Choose to be Children of God in a World Governed by the Children of Man

September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Robespierre received by Al Fike

There is a division in the world. There are the children of God and there are the children of man. Not that this division was ever meant to be, but this division has come about because of the desires and expressions of humanity in the world. The children of God are in a minority, for they are downtrodden and not believed nor given the credit due. The children of man have ascendancy and power, so they have the ability to determine the fate of humanity because their numbers are great.

God is making every effort to turn the tide, to bring the children of God into ascendancy and to make the conditions in the world such that the children of man have little recourse than to acquiesce to the truth. The truth is that love must rule this planet. Love must be the way of being. Whether that be natural love or Divine Love, it must be an expression of each individual in the world, as pure and as high as it can be. Each individual has a choice, whether they may indeed walk the path of love or walk the path of power. Each child grows with the message, *"You must be empowered by your own capacities to walk in the world and that that is the only power that exists,”* besides those who lord over others with political and financial means.

Yet, this is a gross error. There is far greater power outside of the individual than they could possibly comprehend. The children of God, who know this intuitively and instinctively, quietly go about their day, their journey, somewhat fearful and reticent to share the truth that they know for fear of ridicule. The empowerment of man and all his doings, all that he has accomplished, has not brought harmony to him or the Earth, but has brought disarray, even chaos. Many suffer under this edict and perspective.

It is important that you realise that there must be those who stand up to this force, those individuals and groups, the majority of humanity and give the truth. For without those who are willing to stand, the conditions of the world will continue to worsen and the situations that bring pain will continue to proliferate. I ask you, my friends, to be strong in truth, to express love in all the ways that it can be expressed, especially when you have within you the great Love of God, igniting your soul, awakening it and transforming it. This is the most powerful and highest truth of all. Do not keep it to yourself, but express your light. Beloved souls, express your light and be true to that which is truly you and know the joy and peace of one who has lived the truth as fully as one might live and be.

My beloved and beautiful friends, there is so much work to do, so many messages to give to your brothers and sisters, so much light to spread, so much change that needs to come. Do not allow yourself to succumb to the pressures of a world that is out of harmony with God. Instead, with the strength that you carry within your soul, awaken and be that beautiful light channel, blessing for others. It is not easily done. You know this well, but when the world continues to proliferate and capitulate into chaos, where will you be? How will you deal with this situation, this terrible calamity of lost and crippled souls who think that they have the answer and they possess the power to make choices for you? Are you going to acquiesce to their choice for you? Or will you stand forth and say, “No, I will not acquiesce. I will stand up and state the truth and live the truth.” These things, of course, come daily in your choices, in your ability to choose for light, harmony, truth and love. It is for you to decide. It is for you to be that light.

My beloved friends, you must stand strong and be a light. I am Robespierre. I do not think this instrument may pronounce my name correctly, so you may correct him, but I was known in this country as a speaker, writer, philosopher and leader. I come in an attempt to inspire you, dear fellow countrymen, that you may take up the banner of truth and speak of the power of God’s Love to heal, to make right, to bring harmony, to teach the souls how to love, rather than to suppress the tendencies of the soul to be with God and to honour God and to love God. This is what is required, not out of your enforcing this truth, for you cannot, but to express it, to be that example, to walk the road of truth and light so others might see and see that in this great journey, much benefit may come. Many may see that there is joy in your heart and wisdom in your soul, and most of all, love expressed in many ways.

This is the destiny of humanity, but those who will not follow their destiny will suffer a fate that will eliminate them from this world and give them the opportunity in the next to find their way. It is serious times, serious times indeed, but you must walk with your head up high with great faith in God’s plan and to be confident that you will be guided and blessed, that the road will be made clear, the journey will be that which is straight and true toward your Creator, embracing God with every breath, allowing His Touch upon you with prayers earnest and directed toward God.

May God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Robespierre and I love you. I am a Celestial Angel. I walk in the Kingdom of God and I come to you in all earnestness to help you on your journey and to help many find the journey toward light and harmony, peace and joy, all that which comes with love. Blessings to you, my friends, mes amies, many blessings and peace. God bless you.
