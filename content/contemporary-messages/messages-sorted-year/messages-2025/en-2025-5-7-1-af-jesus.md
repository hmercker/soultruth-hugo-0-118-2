May 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come. Your brother and friend, Jesus, is here with you, as I have been with every day. I come to bring my blessings of love, the blessings of the Father through me, the blessings of light coming to be in your midst to purify, heal and uplift you, beloved souls, for you are worthy of this gift. Your souls long for this gift of the Father's Love. It is given in response to your longing, your desire to be at one with God.

You will find your way, beloveds, even though each road has its twists and turns, each life has its distractions and conditions to surmount. You will find your way upon this road to God. It will be glorious, joyful and filled with much blessings for each of you and for this world through you. You are given great gifts, great upliftment and great Love. It is given because you have asked and you have received. You shall continue to do so for eternity, my beloveds. We shall all be on that eternal road together and feed of the Father's Love, so that our lights may be so bright, as bright as the stars of the heavens and yet brighter still. You shall be blessed and given abundantly.

God bless you. I am Jesus and I walk with you always. God bless you.
