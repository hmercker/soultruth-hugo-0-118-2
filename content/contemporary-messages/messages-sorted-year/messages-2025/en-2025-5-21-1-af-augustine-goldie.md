# Remember Joy and Keep a Light Step As You Move Forward

May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2025

DLSF Board Meeting, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine & Goldie received by Al Fike

**Augustine:** It is your teacher, Augustine. God bless you, beloved souls, seekers of truth, servants of God. May you continue in that service, realising that each step forward is in alignment with the Will of God. When you feel hesitant, when there is an issue, as you would call it, regarding your efforts, come to God in prayer and ask for guidance. That is all that is required for you to remain in harmony together and in harmony with your foundation and your efforts to serve God.

You will continue upon these efforts. Indeed, at times you will find roadblocks in the way and some hesitations. Yet, generally, the flow of God's Will will manifest through each one of you and collectively. This is what is required and this is what we desire, for we all work together within the Will of God and we will continue to do so as we progress and serve in this way.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, as you continue to seek the Will of God and to enact the Will of God in your lives and through your efforts together. God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. My love is with you all. You are lights. You are blessed. You will continue to be lights and you will continue to be blessed. God bless you all. My love is with you. God bless you.

**Goldie:** â€¦of why joy is so important. I am Goldie. With joy in your heart, with a light step as you move forward, relying on God's Will and guidance, feeling the joy in your soul, knowing that God is active in your life, active in your actions, active in your thoughts, then how can there be anything but joy, as you continue to serve your Heavenly Father and we continue together in that joyful work to express love, compassion, healing and upliftment to the world.

God bless you. I am Goldie and I joyfully love you. God bless you all.
