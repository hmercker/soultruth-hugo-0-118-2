# Much Has Been Accomplished in these Days

September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

My friends, I am Seretta Kem. I wish to congratulate you on your efforts, the time you have spent with the seeking souls. I wish to assure you that your efforts have been very effective. For, as you are well aware, the many levels and layers of impact that have been made, both in the material and the spirit world, have resulted in ripples of light going out into many places, touching many souls.

I know you see the material manifestation as being humble and simple and not particularly dynamic. Yet, through these many layers, the power of the truth has been shared. Many spirits have gleaned the truth from your efforts. Much work has been accomplished. Indeed, as you make your efforts, this ignites a series of reactions and events that will reverberate through this world and the next and, indeed, will ignite various responses and events that will greatly assist God's plan for the salvation of humanity.

My beautiful friends, you have listened to your guidance. You have listened to the calling that we have given, that God has given. You have responded well, with desire to serve, with loving intent, with integrity and applying yourself as best you could to the task at hand. Thus, much was accomplished because you were willing and open and able to do God's bidding. There is much more work to do, as always, but indeed, you have expressed your gifts and that deep desire within to serve God. We are very pleased and we thank you for your efforts. Blessings will continue to befall you, my beautiful friends. Light is with you. Indeed, even when you are not overtly doing this work, when you travel the streets of this city (Paris), there are blessings being given to others. There is light being shed upon this place and the places that you will walk within. My beloved friends, continue to seek to be guided, to be used as God's instruments, to be in the light and to be in good condition, to be a channel of love and we shall see what will unfold in the coming days.

God bless you, my friends. I am Seretta Kem. I love you so. I appreciate you greatly. Great gratitude in my heart for each of you. May you continue to be blessed in the Father's Love and Light. Continue to grow those gifts, growing, expanding, sharpening in their capacity to penetrate the dark, bringing light, bringing truth and bringing love. All of these things are a part of you and you are expressing beautifully. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with you. God bless you.
