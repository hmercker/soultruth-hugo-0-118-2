Happy Days Farm Retreat, Dallas, UR, USA

Orion & Jesus received by Al Fike

**Orion:** The work at hand has progressed sufficiently, my friends. I am Orion. There is still much to do, but your coming together, each one bringing their beautiful gifts and presence in the circle, has helped to facilitate many things. We congratulate you on your efforts and we invite you to return at some point to continue with these efforts. For there is much to do, as I have said, and many layers and elements of construction and creation that will benefit many in the future, but needs to have the proper foundation, the proper, shall we say, “energetic signature” for you and for us to work in tandem and in harmony together.

God, of course, is blessing all of these things and assisting all of you in your awakening. As you continue to awaken further, as you continue to grow within your souls, so there is a great benefit not only to yourselves but to one another and to the world. So much, my beloved friends, required of you, so much God wishes of each of you. Indeed, your souls desire to serve and to be awakened and to be in harmony with this great plan, these endeavours of light that will help to bring humanity into greater harmony and love.

My beloved friends, thank you for your time and effort, your prayers and your conversations and all that you have done to help make this a successful venture together. God bless you. I am Orion. I am happy to be one who works with you and continues to strive toward the great goal of harmony and peace, love and light in the world. We shall continue to work together in many different ways and many different capacities. These things will be accomplished one step at a time. As you grow, so will this work grow. As you awaken, so will this work be evident and clear and a reflection of that awakening.

My beloved friends, may we continue to pray and work together in loving harmony. May God’s great gift of Love continue to thrive within your soul as you seek it out and accumulate its blessing, so we are within the parameters, the flow of this work together. God bless you. I am Orion. I love you so, my beautiful friends, lights each one. God bless you.

**Jesus:** I come as well, my beloveds. Your brother and friend, Jesus, here to pray with you, to acknowledge you, to love you and to help reinforce our dear brother's message to continue to work together. Continue to forge the bonds of love. Continue to be guided by God. All these things will make a wonderful collaboration of all the aspects, all the spirits, all the souls that are involved. We will work together in loving harmony, in peace and in joy.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am your brother, Jesus and I love you. I love you and have been with you for this time together. God bless you. God bless you.
