# The Work of Prayer

October 13<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

Yes, true children of God, it is good to pray for brothers and sisters upon the Earth, as all can be helped by God’s Love, regardless of the path that they have chosen and even those who have not chosen a path. I am Joan, your sister in Divine Love and true follower of my master, Jesus, who is Master of these Celestial Heavens. We come forward today to be with you in your prayers, helping to strengthen your prayers, coming close to open your souls even more, that you may receive the greatest benefit of God’s blessings.

This is work that you do, especially those of you who live upon the Earth. This is work. There are so many distractions, so many busy things that you believe need to be done. It is good that you take the time together to acknowledge your relationship with God, to feel His Love, to allow it to nurture your souls, to feel His comfort and His blessings. It is good that you do this and we suggest that you come together more often in any way that you can, two of you, three of you, the more the better, the stronger the prayer, the greater the influence and the greater the outcome. Of course, we will always come to be with you. There are so many angels here now and we do uplift you, if you are willing.

The Father uses these Circles of Light to touch the souls of many. This too is a work, one that is perhaps more enjoyable for you than having to deal with the distractions and the busyness that is all over the Earth plane. But know this: when you choose to pray, we will come pray with you, whether it be one or many. Every time you do, you are not only the ones uplifted, but your brothers and sisters upon the Earth plane are touched by the love within your souls and by the blessings that our Heavenly Father provides to them through you.

This is a great work that you do as you pray. We encourage you to pray often, as often as possible. As I said, there are many benefits to frequent prayer.
