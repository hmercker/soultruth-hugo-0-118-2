Lao Tzu received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the love of God and the joys of heaven be with you all.

I am the one known as Lao Tzu, the founder of the Tao, also sometimes referred to as “The Way.” I am often associated with one that you may know quite well, Confucius. We met while on earth, and I would say he was a mentor to me, both on earth and in spirit. We are both inhabitants of the celestial kingdom. We were not disposed to the idea of a personal God, yet we felt and referred to the Source as Heaven, and all things under Heaven, and in alignment, being harmonious. The works of Confucius and I helped people to live in harmony, be in community, find right employment, and this, of course, was being a very beautiful way of expressing harmony in the natural love.

Having been in spirit for centuries, both my brother Confucius and I met the Master Jesus and became acquainted with the truths of Divine Love and your way, which is also our way. We have been able to encourage, enlighten, teach, and bring into clarity the truths of Divine Love and prayer. So, I’m giving you quite a long introduction, but I wish to come tonight to bridge the worlds of the natural harmony and the Divine Love. I think this is best expressed by saying that what appears to be a great struggle in the lives of humans on earth is, in fact, a self-created delusion. For each one here knows that when you are in the flow of love, all things conspire for your happiness. All things become exposed, and the mind takes a step back as the soul and the heart rejoice. Those who struggle to stay in grace, to be in prayer, find that when they connect with God and the celestial heavens, there is an easing. What appeared to be a struggle dissipates, and of course, there is the necessary engagement and longing to connect, but this only requires one to be aware of their deep longing and, rather than trying to fulfill it in worldly ways, to allow their souls to reach out directly to their Creator. In this way, all are blessed, all are changed. When you reach out to the world in this state of being, in what some call holy communion, which is a fitting way to describe it, when you reach out in this way, you bring the blessings of heaven to earth and as the rain comes and showers the earth, God’s love comes and fills your soul and nourishes it. This is why we come again and again, for one can never receive enough of the gift of the substance of God’s love, even those of us in the celestial realm, ever open to more and more, and what a joy it is, and how we wish that you all find this freedom in the love of God and leave your worries behind you. Leave your troubles. For even if you fear the end of your mortal life, you have tasted immortality. You’ll have touched on eternity.

Stay in this grace, and all good things will come about in each soul, in your community, and in your relations with the world.

May the great love of God be upon us and in us and may the joys of heaven truly be yours.

I am your brother and friend in the love of God. I am Lao Tzu.

God bless you.
