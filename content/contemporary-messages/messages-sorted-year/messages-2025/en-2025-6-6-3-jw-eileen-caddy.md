# When you create for the sake of others in God’s love

May God’s love infill your souls. It is I, Aunty Eileen, Eileen Caddy.

When you come together as you have in this sacred circle, you draw many, many souls, unseen. They come attracted to the light and the magnetism of God’s love. You choose to come together, not only despite whatever differences you may have, but rather, because of them. Each one brings a unique soulful insight. This is how community is formed with like-minded, like-hearted, blessed souls, who wish to be at one in the great love of God. Decisions are made through consensus rather than by one leader; this is truly the way to cooperate and to move forward. Because you are a creative group, you can also put forth a new and unique idea, even a practice, a prayer, a song, a recipe, to be included, to lift you. For one of the great values of coming together is the uniqueness of each soul being valued. Their gifts appreciated. All coming together in gratitude and consensus.

You have chosen to ask for the highest. Whatever else comes, every good and perfect gift is icing on the cake. At Findhorn, we chose not to limit ourselves, but to seek the greatest good, to be inclusive, and to be at-one in blessing, in prayer, in work, in building community, and as you know, thousands have come. Many stay, some for a time, others longer. The foundation of Findhorn was based on my guidance from God and the angels, and when we followed that guidance, it wasn’t to elevate me but to elevate each soul.

In the United States, you have much diversity but also much divisiveness. This is also true throughout the world to some extent. But on your currency, it is written *E. Pluribus Unum, “in the many or out of the many is one.”* When you allow the flow of your love to reach out to all, you create the divine currency. You open hearts and hearts that have been closed, touched by your love, healed. The picture being a closed fist now open, allowing the pain to dissipate in the awakening of your souls as you let go and allow God to touch you.

Whatever it is that you wish to bring to the world, create for the sake of others, whether it be for sanctuary, whether it be song, spoken word, prayer, writings, dance, painting, all the arts, when created in the spirit, the Holy Spirit, in God’s love, you send a blessing, you send your light, God’s light, into the world. So, in the greater reality, you are in community every day, and when you are allowed to contribute, and I certainly hope you are, you bring a blessing. You bring a light to the darkness; you bring peace to the disturbance. You bring faith over fear, trust over doubt, and above all, love. So, dream on in the love of God. Act on your creative impulses, your prayerful longings, while you are still on this good earth, so in need of a blessing that each one of you carries in your soul.

It is my delight to come and join you with the many. All of us who love you dearly, who are at your call. When you ask, we shall come. When you need an answer, go in prayer, for we will do God’s bidding to assist you. Go in the love of God and in the harmony of community. I am your sister, in Christ, and your friend.

I am Eileen Caddy. May God bless you.
