# Opens Harrow Retreat: Sing Your Soulful Song of Truth

September 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Harrow Retreat, Harrow, UK

Estelle Roberts received by Al Fike

Life without truth is life without meaning. Life without love is life that is hollow. Truth and love must enter the hearts of everyone. This emboldens the individual to live life, to be a part of life. When their minds are engaged in an intellectual pursuit that, in the big picture of life, has no true meaning, then this is a life wasted, a life that has not understood the intentions of living upon this Earth of yours.

For this is a short period of time, is it not? There is far greater life within the spirit world. What do you carry there? What do you bring with you, but your experiences, your capacities to think, feel and be? It is not so much knowledge that you carry with you. It is the essence that is truth that will put you in good stead on the other side, the truth of the soul, which these individuals, these dear friends, are speaking of, are the deep truths that are of great benefit to everyone. They will indeed change your perspective of life, your perspective of yourself, your perspective of God.

I encourage you to listen and to seek out the experiences of the soul, for it is in this milieu that you will find truth that is everlasting, find meaning that is of truth and most of all, most of all, my friends, to find Love, Love that is higher than the love that you have felt or known. The Love of God is the greatest love of all. It can be given through the simple prayer that has been taught. I urge you, as we continue upon this short time together in learning and experiencing, to open yourselves with the innocence of the soul, for the soul speaks its truth, the soul expresses its abilities to know and feel and be in the grace of God.

My beautiful friends, friends of this church, friends who have come to support and be in the light, there is no higher truth than love and there is no higher love than the Love of God. Come to know this, my beautiful friends, and you will have the key to a good life, a beautiful life. We, on the spirit side of life, will be here to uphold you, to assist you and to pray with you. Each of you have your guides, your gatekeepers, those spirits that help you, but when you engage in this Truth of Love, the Divine Love, you will have higher guides, angels by your side and they will uplift you beyond your imaginings. Your soul will sing to God, as this dear soul's song has indicated. Singing the truth of the soul is indeed of your highest and greatest aspirations. I urge you, my friends, I urge you to truly be with God in those moments of prayer and contemplation.

I am Estelle, a true friend of this church. I urge you to step forward into this light of truth and sing your song, for it is beautiful and unique to each one of you. Blessings to you. My love is with you and my support. God bless you, beloved souls.
