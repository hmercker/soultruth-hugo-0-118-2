# The Truth of God's Love Surpasses Any Barriers of Language and Culture

June 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

Other Prayer Groups, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, fellow travellers upon the Divine Path. I am your teacher, Augustine. The Truth of God's Love surpasses any barriers of culture, language and situations in your world. These are feelings of the heart and the soul. The barriers are created by the mind. It is your task to help break down those barriers for those who you meet and those who you wish to bring this beautiful message of Love to.

There is much fear and judgement in the world. Indeed, the culture of what you are engaging in is full of these impediments. It is the result of history, the result of individuals who have transgressed truth and light and created darkness and abuse. Thus, those who think of God think of what you would call religion. They think of these things, rather than something positive and of light. Therefore, you have a great task ahead of you. The only way these barriers can be broken is to be a channel of light, truth and love.

You cannot convince another with the mindful arguments of truth. Rather, you must convince others through the flowing of love, light and acceptance, reaching out to the lost souls. There are many in need in your country, my dear friends. There are many who are afraid. Thus, when you ask to be used as an instrument of love, of God's Will and God's plan, then it is important to realise that you, as an individual, cannot surmount these barriers alone, but must use God's blessings, the angels that are provided to you and in your midst and the wisdom of your own soul in order to reach out to these individuals.

In times, there will be manifestations and blessings that will surmount many of these barriers. Yet, for the moment, the barriers remain and they are difficult to surmount. I ask you, my beloved and beautiful friends, students of truth, be gentle as you walk. Be forgiving, patient and loving, for when you are these things, who would turn you away? There are many who seek love, who seek acceptance and who seek comfort. The way in which you give this may not necessarily be spoken, but be demonstrated. This will help curtail the barriers and help you to reach the hearts of others.

Do not be overly concerned about teaching this truth. Rather, be a light and be a channel of love. In this way, those who are receptive will be drawn. In time, they will ask questions and open the door to further conversation. You are each blessed and gifted. Each of you will find your gifts, expression of gifts, in ways that will bless and benefit many. We are working with you all. We will continue to do so.

God bless you all. I am your teacher, Augustine. I love you all. God bless you.
