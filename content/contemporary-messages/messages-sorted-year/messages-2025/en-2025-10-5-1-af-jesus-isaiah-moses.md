Jesus, Isaiah & Moses received by Al Fike

**Jesus:** Yes, I come, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you. We rejoice at your gathering, your efforts and your prayers, the desire to bring truth into the souls of humanity, the desire to be God's instruments in the world, the desire to bring greater light to this world.

My beloveds, all of these desires and intentions and prayers make you truly a part of my ministry, for this I too desire. This I too dedicate my life towards, to help uplift humanity, to help bring truth to all. I am joyful when I hear from others reciting prayers that I would recite, putting forth to God intentions that I too have, bringing to light that which is needed to be brought into the light of truth. This too is my ministry. As such, you become my disciples, beloved souls, disciples of truth, disciples that are reflective of the Truth of God's Love and how this truly does heal and transform the soul.

There is much work, my beloveds, much to do. In order for you to accomplish these tasks, you must be firmly within the reality of the soul and the light of the soul that has been touched by God. When you are in this truth, living it in the way that is intended, then you are truly harbingers and lights for God. As you walk in this light, as you seek out the truth of this light and Love, you are truly being blessed and you draw the angels close. Do not let any conditions of the mind, any scepticism and doubt creep into your thoughts, for when you have faith, when you have truly experienced the redeeming touch of God's Love, there is no room for doubt. There is no room for scepticism. If these things exist within you, then you are entertaining that which is of the mind and that which is of the human condition. You must strive to move beyond these things and be freed within the soul of all that is of light and truth. There joy will rise up and extinguish any thought or doubt that is contrary to this truth.

Feel the joy of your heart, my beloveds, for the joy of your heart signals that it feels close to God, that it is close to God and this is your sign and signal that you have found the right path, the path that nourishes your soul, the path that brings truth to your mind and your soul, the path that will redeem and transform you so that you are truly a child of God. There is nothing greater and nothing higher than this gift of God's Love given to each mortal and spirit who desires to have it. It is not restricted to anyone, but is open to all. Can you feel its touch? Do you feel the warm glow radiating within your centre, a glow that is responding to God's Touch, a feeling that is deep and abiding within? This is the Touch of God's Holy Spirit upon you. This is the beginning of the awakening of your soul and its eventual transformation from mortal to immortal.

It is given step by step, prayer by prayer. It touches you ever more deeply and brings you ever closer to your Heavenly Father, a great Comforter, a great blessing that brings great change, great awareness, deep and wondrous visions and experiences that originate from the soul touched by God. So much is given and is available to you, my beloveds. It is for you to step forward and say, *“I wish to have this. I wish to be blessed by this. I wish for your Love to enter into my soul and that it do so in great abundance, that I may truly feel the redemptive qualities and powers of this blessing and know the light that comes with this gift from you, dear God, your Hand upon me, your Love pouring in.”*

This is my desire. This is the prayer that you must all have and express with sincerity, that the needs of your soul may take precedence over the conditions of the mind. That the truth of the soul may override all that which is of the mind, that you may have within you that needed balance, strength and light that will lead you upon the road of your life towards greater harmony, greater capacity to love and greater truth. Be true to your soul's desires, my beloveds, and all the universe of God will be laid before you. As your soul grows, changes and awakens, so you will be able to perceive and experience all of these wonders, all of these blessings.

You are my brothers and sisters. We walk together upon this path of Love. We are truly, truly God's children. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens. I love you all, my blessed friends on Earth, aspiring instruments of God, channels of love, disciples of truth. May we be in that Hall of Peace together, feel the wonders that God's Touch and know the gifts that He brings. God bless you, my beloveds. I come. I come for you because I love you. We are bonded in truth and love. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.

**Isaiah:** God bless you. I am Isaiah. I too come to assure you of the truth. I come to assert the truth and to affirm that our beloved brother, Jesus, is truly the harbinger of truth, love and light. I come to affirm him. I come to affirm your desires of soul to seek out this gift. This is the highest road, my beloveds. This is the highest road to truth and shall bring truth everlasting into your heart and souls.

That truth will prevail and will change you and inform your passage of life, not only here, but in spirit, until that wondrous day when you enter into the halls of the Celestial Kingdom. God gives you all that you require, beloveds. God is with you now. Seek its blessing, the blessing of the Holy Spirit and you shall know the benefits, not only in the moment, but for all eternity.

God bless you. Isaiah loves you.

**Moses:** I am Moses. I too come to affirm the Master's declarations of truth. I come to support you all in your efforts to seek truth. I come as a light, a friend, a brother and a harbinger of truth. I come because the Master speaks truth and opens the portals of truth to this world. In this, many angels and bright spirits come to affirm his words and to pray with you as you seek the truth.

I come, for I am humbled by our beloved brother, Jesus, and his capacity to bring love and light to all. It is a great gift given to you, beloved souls, that he comes to speak and he comes to bless you. We gather around this bright and warming fire of God's Love and seek the nourishment that it gives, for this seeking will never end, and this blessing will be eternal.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Moses and I come to affirm the truth.
