# Guidance to Teach Former Island Residents

June 29<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Beams of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Joseph Babinsky received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Joseph Babinsky. I come once more to join in prayer with my brothers and sisters upon the Earth. Your light shines so very bright and there are many here who have come to see and learn about this light. For this is a powerful prayer circle. You attract many who used to live upon your island and many more will be coming each time you pray, for there is golden light around you. They seek to know in their souls what is the truth, for they have lingered here far too long.

Pray for these souls. Invite them in as we strengthen our prayers with the help of our brothers and sisters in the Celestial Spheres. They take us above the Earth plane and these souls are encapsulated, surrounded by this Love. You are new, dear children, and we welcome you. Let your most loving thoughts, your most loving feelings, ascend to the One who created all of us and you shall see that you become brighter and lighter.

The Master joins us, with blessings for each one. It is a privilege for me to join you all. I am Joseph Babinsky.
