# The Angels Bless the Cultural Diversity of Humanity on Earth

January 31<sup>st</sup>, 2025

San Salvador Estate, Trinidad

Matthew received by Al Fike

I am Matthew. The world is a very diverse place, is it not? God does not wish to disrupt or destroy cultures created by man. It is Godâ€™s wish to add to these cultures love, so that they are sustained in love, harmony and peace. So, we come, His angels come to add these blessings wherever they are accepted, appreciated and desired.

The culture in Heaven is not so diverse, for all the individuals that have landed in Heaven through their various experiences, trials and tribulations have come to similar conclusions and understandings regarding life. Therefore, the need to delineate between one race and another, one individual and another, is not so great. Regarding our appearance, we do not have any great distinctions or differences in our appearance, our skin colour and our culture.

Yet, indeed, Heaven is a long way from Earth. Here, diversity is important to all of you. You cling to your ideas and your cultures. You cling to your perspectives and your way of life. It brings you comfort. It has been ingrained within your consciousness, these ideas and perspectives. Yet, the great Love of God, this blessing, dissolves the barriers and the differences. For Love is a unifying force. Love brings all together in harmony and Love allows acceptance, tolerance and forbearance, honouring the differences and yet, accepting at the same time.

My beloved and beautiful friends, you are all part of the family of humanity, though you have different perspectives, different languages and different backgrounds. You know within your souls that you have experienced something unique and something that is similar. You have come to know God and the blessings of God entering your heart and your soul uplifting you. The universal language of love is unifying you and God's blessings have no differentiation, no language. It is of the soul and the soul accepts and is open. The soul desires this and the blessings of God have no language other than love. So, we are together, with different cultures and different perspectives. Yet, there is love, honouring and appreciation. There are blessings flowing forth, light surrounding, protection given and angels with you all.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, in this unifying Love, this Love that honours every soul, this Love that brings perspectives into harmony, truth and peace. This is the way of God and this is our way. We are here to be with you and shall be with you for the time that you are together. We love each one of you, each one precious, beautiful and unique. God bless you. May His Love flow within your soul and see, from those eyes, that perspective. We love you. We are close. I am Matthew and I love you. I am close. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
