Faith Nyquist & Jesus received by Al Fike

**Faith:** God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Faith.

The journey of life is all about how to learn how to love. Of course, as you take that journey of life, you become individuated, your personality is expressed, your unique character and soul finds its expression in your body and your spirit. Yet, all of these things are instruments for you to be a loving channel, an expression of light in the world. When you come to understand this, and you come to understand the highest Love given and received, the Divine Love of God, then you have truly mastered the essence of what life is.

Of course, that journey continues through the many years of existence in your fleshy body, but also as you continue on the journey of the spirit body. Yet you, my beloved friends, have recognised this invitation and this necessity early on, for many do not. Many do not understand that purpose, that invitation that God gives to you, to express love in everything that you are and everything that you do. When the world is able to embrace this truth, then there will be no more suffering, no more wars, no more disease, for it is love that will heal and transform and uplift everything.

When you come to a group like this, seeking to fulfil your soul's desire to receive this great gift from God, realising that each time you do so, each time you pray for this gift, you are adding to the great momentum that will change the world and heal the world. To bring this grace into your soul, to learn what it is and to allow it to express itself through you, is your contribution to change the world from darkness to light. You have come to understand that God loves you. You have come to a place of loving yourself and you are learning how to love others. You embrace the journey wholeheartedly with integrity and desire, with effort and prayer. You come in the ways in which God intends for you to grow and to awaken and be transformed. My beloved friends, you take the high road, the road that will lead to at-onement with God. For God is all Love. As you embrace this truth, as you grow in this truth and as you express this truth, so you come closer to our Creator. You come closer to realising, in the fullness of it, the power of Love, the grace of Love, the blessings of Love.

My beloved friends, continue to long for this gift, to be awakened by it, to journey toward greater light, to express great light and love in your lives. This will fulfil you. This will bring you to a place of deep peace and joy. There is no other journey like this. There is no other higher calling than this. This is the way that God intends for every soul. This is the invitation that God has given to every soul. To find your way in love is to find true life’s fulfilment, grace and peace.

I pray with you that you may know this gift and that it may be given abundantly and powerfully. I am your friend Faith. I love you so and I pray with you this day. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.

**Jesus:** I bring you peace, my beloveds. I come. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you, as do many angels. I come to bring you the gift of peace, to uplift you into the Hall of Peace, to relieve you of your burdens and the conditions of this world in the joy of God's Love. You are given the healing and blessings that shall sustain peace around you and within you.

My love is with you, beloveds. I am Jesus. I come to bless you with all that God wishes for you to have. Open yourselves fully and receive fully what is given and what shall be given. God bless you. My love is with you always. God bless you, my beloveds. God bless you.
