Creating Sanctuary Meeting, Nashville, TN, USA

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, Care.

I know you feel a bit detached from those who seem not quite as interested in creating physical sanctuary, places of refuge, and a sustainable environment. Even those who can see the volatile earth changes, the splitting apart at the seams in many places, they cannot perceive what might be necessary to sustain a Divine Love community. I was part of a community. I think the very first Divine Love community in California and it was a result of people coming together in prayer, having the same aspirations, and following the Padgett messages. We came from many different places, perhaps I can say many different agendas we had, and yet we were one in prayer.

Living in a community has its blessings and its challenges. This turns away many people who prefer the comfort of a reliable existence, though even they can see it’s not as reliable as one might wish. So many messages have been delivered to your group and beyond about the Earth changes, about the challenges and difficulties that lie ahead, which are in fact happening as I speak to you. It has been said that the average person, and I don’t mean anything negative by that, but just people living on the planet, working, eating, sleeping, in some kind of normalcy, whether they be rich or poor, will choose what is in the moment working, whereas you who have a vision of a more sustainable, more loving, embracing, Divine Love community that has physical places of sanctuary, gardens, gatherings, retreats, can see that this is a possibility in many ways and in many places, according to those who gravitate to the ones they wish to be with. I’ll give you an example. For some, it might be preferable to be in an environment with vegetarian food or vegan food. For others who are not inclined as such, it might be coming together in prayer, it might be healing, or ceremonies, or healing sessions. For others, it might really be just community, rather than being somewhat timid about sharing their privacy in the community. They’re the ones who embrace it and lean on each other and know the benefits of working together, all of one mind, in the sense that all know taking a step in faith in prayer for God’s love, beyond the rational mind, produces results because God is the Provider.

And those of us who serve God in the celestial realms we always come to assist you in prayer, and along with us, there are many who assist with your material needs. I would ask you gently, lovingly, to never assume limitation, to remember that every good and perfect gift is provided, and whether there are three of you, four of you, four hundred of you, four million of you, when you walk forward in faith, we are there. So, continue with your vision. We shall do our best to inspire you, to influence you.

But remember this, every soul wishes to be free, wishes to be unburdened, wishes to live in harmony, wishes to have a song in their heart and a prayer from their soul, though they may not know it, but you do. Someone has to be at the forefront. And as the Master told the prayer group, he is the captain of the ship, and God is the wind in the sails.

So, trust yourselves, trust in this guidance, and above all, trust in God and His great love for you. I hope I have been helpful, and I come with nothing but love for all. God bless you and guide you. I am your sister in Christ.

I am Care.
