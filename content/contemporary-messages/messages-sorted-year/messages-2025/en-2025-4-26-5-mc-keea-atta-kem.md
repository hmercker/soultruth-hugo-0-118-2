Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

Good morning. I am Keea Atta Kem. What a pleasure it is to be able to come and join you in your quaint circle where you grow in your ability to open yourself up, to open your soul and to open your mind to the great possibility of the inflowing, through the Holy Spirit, of God's Divine Love. I come as a teacher, as a guide and as a helper to those who desire to discover more about the truth of who they are, who are seeking more, who have felt that niggling within them that there must be something else, that there could be something else. They seek and, as the saying goes, *“Seek and you shall find, ask and it is given.”*

While you may only think that you are asking from your mind, in truth, you are here because a yearning within your soul drives you, a desire for something greater, a desire to be nurtured in truth, wisdom, and love. This is the great blessing of one who receives the inflowing of God's Love within their soul, for it is the very Essence and Substance of God's Love that comes into you and begins its transformation on the substance of your soul, transformation from being a creation of the image of God moving into the Substance of God and those Divine attributes that emanate from God.

It is a path that requires effort and that requires a desire to receive and to grow, and for the soul to be developed in this way. One's free will is a powerful gift that every soul has been given. No other can interfere with this will, not even the Creator, God who has created you. While this Love flows abundantly toward every soul, constantly and eternally, it is something that each individual must make, a free will choice to open themselves and ask.

When I say to ask, it is not a mental faculty. It is a soul faculty, a longing, a yearning, a desire from the deep place within you to be touched by this highest blessing that is available to all and withheld from none. When the soul is touched by this Love and it finds a lodgement within the soul, there begins a working of sorts upon the human condition, those aspects of the individual that are not in harmony with the Laws of Love and God's creation. Every mortal has these conditions within them. The workings of this Love begin to transform and eradicate these parts of the individual, whether that be anger, greed, grief, resentment, lust, doubt or insecurity. Whatever condition holds this beautiful soul back from expressing itself freely in truth and love shall be transformed.

In this transformation, as the human condition changes, these Divine qualities of peace, joy, love, acceptance, compassion and so much more begin to inform the individual and their personality. Their nature becomes one of the Divine. It is a very simple method, but one that is very profound and has the ability to transform a soul into a divine soul, at one with the Creator, where the only possible response to all circumstances is love. When a soul is transformed in this way, it is no longer able to respond through the conditions it once had from its human experience. This Love, because it flows to you at all times, can be received in any moment. If you put your mind's attention upon desiring to discover more, you draw around you the Celestial Angels, those whose souls have been transformed by this Love and are now a part of the Divine Love, the Essence of God.

We have a great investment in all mortals, beautiful souls on Earth, in helping them to discover their way into freedom, love and joy, where they begin to live their life informed by the existence of the Love that is within their soul, opposed to the material mind, the material world and the very demands that living on Earth puts upon a soul. You have reached a point in your lives where you can dedicate your progression of soul to a spiritual path. This, dear souls, the path of Divine Love, is one that will transform you with every drop that comes in. You will find that because you have dedicated time and listened to the desire within your soul to receive this Love, when you transition into the spirit world, you will find yourself in a place of light, of peace and of joy.

It all depends on how seriously one is about their spiritual path here. I encourage you to invest yourself, invest your time and invest your life in receiving this blessing, for no harm shall come to you. Progression is a beautiful path to walk. Great change will come to you. While change is not always easy, this change is about releasing those things that no longer serve you and walking with certainty, steadfast with the soul leading the life, allowing its purpose to unfold and continuing its journey to at-onement with God.

May you each be blessed mightily with this Love, this blessing freely given to all that ask, sincerely ask. I am Keea Atta Kem. Thank you for listening to my words. I hope I have been able to bring a little insight and inspiration to support you on your spiritual journey. God bless you.
