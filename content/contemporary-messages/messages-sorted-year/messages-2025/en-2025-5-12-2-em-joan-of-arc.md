# A Gift of Strength

May 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am Joan of Arc. I bless this circle with my love. I come today to pray with you, to help uplift you and to love you greatly. The strength that you feel is from the love within this group for each other. This is possible because of the Love in your souls. I say this to you because as things continue to change in a way that is unfamiliar to many people, you will know to bring forth your love, which will manifest in part as strength. Those who need comfort will be drawn to you.

This is a gift from God for all those souls who do need comforting. As you manifest your love, those who need comforting will be drawn to you because of the strength of this love. My Father told me to come today and present to you this gift, for you will need it in the near future. Feel the strength now that your love is active and know that this is within you. Whether you are in a circle or not, it is in each one of you.

I am your sister, Joan. It is my pleasure to be here today and to explain this blessing to you. God loves each one of you very deeply, as you have prayed for. Stay open. Stay open to His Love and you will walk through any kind of disruption that may occur without anxiety. May God bless you. May you stay open and keep in the Light of our Heavenly Father. I am Joan of Arc. I dearly love each and every one of you. God bless you.
