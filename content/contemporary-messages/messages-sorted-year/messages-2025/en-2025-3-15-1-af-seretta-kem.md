Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

My friends, I am Seretta Kem. Indeed, you are a very complex creature. We all are in our makeup, emotional, physical, mindful, spiritual and soulful. All of these things are in constant interplay on various levels, the interplay of the spirit body with the physical body, the energies that are involved, energies that are often impeded by emotional conditions, energies that are focused on various parts of the body in need of healing or in pain.

The soul is not a physical thing. It is not made up of synapses and cells. Even in respect or in comparison with the energetic makeup of the spirit body, it is not made up in this way, either. It is the reflection of God within you in the image of God within you. It is very difficult for you on the material plane to understand and delineate between your consciousness, which often resides within your mental, material being and body and the consciousness of the soul, which is different indeed, made up of different components and a different form.

The contradiction of understanding the true self, that of the soul compared to the self that you are aware of and utilise in everyday matters, creates a great challenge for all of you. Even in prayer, you are more often within the material mind and the desires of the material mind compared to the desires of the soul in its immaterial form. You receive signals and inclinations that bubble up from the soul but are interpreted by the other layers and levels of your consciousness, until finally, they reach your mind and are turned into words when you are in prayer.

Most of what you do in your own personal awakening and development is merely a reflection, an image of the true soul condition, thought and desire. To dig through these layers of interpretation and filtering is difficult indeed. We come to help you to do so. We understand the workings of your soul. We are well aware of the desires and inclinations of your soul. For our souls are well-developed and the perceptions thereof are well- developed. Yet, you are still beginning this. Thus, the perceptions of the soul for most of you are rather meagre and are often combined and confused with the interpretations that come as these things rise up into your consciousness.

I do not say these things to inhibit you or discourage you, but so that you might understand that the journey is an arduous one in terms of truly understanding your true self and that it does require discipline. It requires all the things that our dear daughter and dear son have indicated and more. Most of all, it requires considerate and dedicated prayer. For it is the soul that needs to be strengthened, needs to be nourished, needs to be opened and transformed by the Love of God. For within that soul are all that you require to truly understand yourself and to truly be yourself, the self that God created, the self that makes you different from all other creatures on your planet, the self that allows you and brings you to that place of communing with God, the self that has great wisdom and the self that is filled with joy and filled with great desire to be at-one with God.

These are the higher inclinations of the soul. These are the inclinations you need to acknowledge and to exercise in prayer. The more that you do so, the more evident these inclinations will be. The more you do so and receive this great gift from God, the more powerful your soul faculties will be, ignited to life and be expressed in all their beauty and wonderment. You will be changed by this, but not truly changed by mental exercises and efforts to change patterns. These will change the surface conditions of your consciousness. Indeed, these things are helpful, but true change, lasting change, eternal change comes from the soul, the soul ignited by the Touch of God.

These are the things that we desire for you to develop. These are the things that we are engaged with you to help you to develop. These are the things that, when in prayer, we come close to reinforce and to clear away any obstructions toward these blessings given to the soul. If you are engaged and focused on mindful things, then you will find that the results of your prayers will be mindful, will satisfy the mind and will encourage the mind. Beneath that condition, which is very common amongst you because you are human, are the workings and the activities of the soul, which are going on in tandem with the workings of your mind. Ideally, our wish for you, and I am sure your wish for yourself, is to be more attuned to these workings that are deep within you, rather than to be drawn to these surface conditions, feelings, sensations and mindful patterns.

Some days, you are quite successful with this. Other days, you are not. This is what makes it so difficult on your earthly plane to be in harmony with God in such a way that you are aware of it, experience it and benefit from it. Yet, you must continue to make these efforts, to go deeper, to be in that place of harmony with God, to be in the grace of God, to feel it, to know it and to express it. The more you can do this, the more powerful will be your instrumentality and the more versatile will be your gifts expressed through that instrumentality.

Yet, indeed, each of you, in your own way, struggle and are engaged in this halting effort to be in harmony with God. We do not judge you for this, beloved souls. We too were once human. We too understand the challenges of an earthly life. Yet, we are here to uphold you, to assist you on this journey of soul awakening and transformation. If you are willing, so are we. If your desire is there, you open the door for us to work more effectively in the development of true soul awareness, in the development of your relationship with God and in the development of your relationship with yourself.

I urge you, beloved souls, as our beloved daughter has taught, to be introspective and self-aware and to take responsibility for these conditions that you harbour, some so much a part of you that they are reflexive and often in the background, unnoticed. There is so much within you that is taking place that often contradicts your true desire to be in harmony with the Laws of God, God’s creation and God’s Love. Thus is the fate of humanity. You are here to contradict that fate, to challenge it and to step forward into a new way of being and doing in the world. With that desire to do so, you trigger an avalanche of support, love, light, upliftment, protection, truth and peace.

This is your reward for your desires, to do the bidding of your soul, to understand the bidding of God, to put the two together, making a formidable force within you that will guide you for all the days of your life, that will show you the way, will help you to understand the impediments, help you to overcome them and help you to be in greater harmony, in greater light and greater love. These things God wishes for each one of you. We wish for each one of you. They will be given in accordance with your desires and your efforts.

I thank you for your efforts, beloved souls, beautiful children of God. Know that I love you and I am with all of you, helping you and assisting you upon this journey. I am Seretta Kem and I love you. God bless you, beloved souls. You are not judged. You are loved. You are not condemned to darkness. You are reaching for the light. You are not ineffective as a light. Your gifts of the soul grow and expand. Soon you will see many revelations showing you who you truly are. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
