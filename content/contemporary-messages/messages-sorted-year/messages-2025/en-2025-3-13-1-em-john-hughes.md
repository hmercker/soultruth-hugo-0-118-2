# One Person's Prayer Extends Beyond One Person

March 13<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

To all your souls who come to pray, welcome. I am John, my beloved's beloved, known as John Hughes. As you come together to pray, as you lift up your souls, as you lift up your heart to the Father, you bring such blessings, not only upon yourselves, but to people upon the Earth for whom you pray and even beyond them. Because as they are blessed, so are their loved ones.

You see, one person's prayer extends beyond one person. Many people's prayers go deep in the field, so that many, many are served. This is how you are being blessed today. This is how you are being blessed every time you join in prayer with another. Gather your family and friends and pray together. You need not wait for a circle, because we will be there when you are ready.

You are so blessed. May you be open to all of God's blessings, all of God's blessings for you. My love is with you all. I am John Hughes.
