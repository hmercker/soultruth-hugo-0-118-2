Augustine received by Al Fike

May the blessings of the Father's Love continue to pour into your souls, beloved children of God, seekers of truth. I am your teacher, Augustine. For those who wish for a quick healing and transformation in your world that is so accustomed to immediate responses and upliftment that brings gratification, you will be sorely disappointed with the gift of God's Love. For this is not instant gratification. This is a step-by-step plodding along the path toward spiritual progression and toward soul transformation.

Even the apostles at Pentecost were not instantly transformed by the Father's Love. Indeed, they had a great inflowing of this Love. In that inflowing came revelations and true understanding of the power of God's Love. This was enough to spur them on in their ministrations and duties to God to teach the power of God's Love, but they were not completely transformed. Indeed, the only one to enter into the Celestial Kingdom from the Earth plane is the beloved Master himself, for he had a purified soul to begin his journey, something that none of you, nor anyone since, has had.

The struggle in the journey is great. The capacity for change, transformation, healing and releasing the encrustations of the soul takes time and effort. Those who are frustrated and lack patience upon this journey often fall away because this is not what they seek. They seek the instant gratification, the erasing of their soul's condition replaced by joy, love and the freedom that comes with it. Yes, a light grows within the soul, but the soul must continue to grapple with the incursion of the mind and the desires of the mind to dictate the journey and to dictate your behaviour.

As you follow along this path of progression, which is often a trial-and-error journey, you eventually come to certain realisations, healings and revelations that help you along the road that, indeed, allow you to discard the error to a degree. This is why you must make your prayers to receive Divine Love a daily practice. For if you do not feed the soul with this Love, if you do not remind yourself of this Love, if you do not go to God daily with the humility and desire to receive this gift that God offers to you, then often you are distracted and it is more difficult to find your way upon the path.

The world is full of distractions. The world is full of those who would detract from your efforts and also spirits who would surround you and do the same. Your efforts must be strong and mighty, must be dedicated and pure. If you are to truly be transformed in the Father's Love, then that process must be a daily part of your life. Indeed, as you pray daily for this gift, the drop-by-drop incursion that it applies into your soul and into your consciousness will change your attitudes, your feelings and your perceptions. You will know the joy of God's Love as it rises up from the very centre of your being. You will find that this gift of Love will change you in many ways, as this blessing infiltrates all parts of your being.

Yet, first and foremost, you must desire this gift. Desire it with the tenacity and the dedication that puts your prayers front and forward in your life so that these efforts to pray will bring their results and they will be tangible. Yet, if you assume that this Love exists within your soul without effort, without desire and without prayer, you are incorrect. It is placed within you through your prayers, your asking and your desire to receive it. This is the only way it will be a part of your soul and accumulate within you.

Do not assume, my beloved students, that because you are good, because you are diligent in spiritual matters, and yet you do not include a conscious prayer of desire to receive this Love, that it will transform you without this intention and this effort. For it cannot. You may, through happenstance, receive a measure of this Love. Many on the Earth plane have done so, but because they have not understood consciously the process of receiving this gift,  the amount that they receive is somewhat meagre compared to what is required to accomplish the transformation of the soul.

My beloved students, you know this to be true. You have experienced this for yourself. I merely come to reinforce and to remind you of the process of what is required. Even if your mind is intent on rearranging my teachings so that you might rationalise the efforts that do not include conscious asking for this gift, you will not receive in the abundance, the power and the effort that is required to bring this Love forth in your soul to such an extent that you are changed irrevocably and that you are gifted in Love, not the natural love which you have and often express, but with this comes the Divine Love, which is solely of God's Soul. Therefore you must add unto yourself, your light, your condition, your soul and your consciousness that gift of Love that God wishes to give to you, so that you may truly shine forth in a light that is unique to God and is given to you in Love and as a gift.

Seek this gift, beloved souls. Seek it with all your heart and with all your desire. God shall surely bless you as His Holy Spirit conveys this gift into your soul, longing and receptive as it is. I give you a teaching that is fundamental to the Divine Love Path. It is something that bears repetition, for if you are truly to walk this path and benefit from this gift, you must ingrain within your consciousness your understanding of Truth, this fundamental yet simple Truth that leads the way and that brings all gifts and blessings in its stead.

God bless you, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I love you so, those of you who continue to strive upon the Path Divine and seek out the Father's Love. In this way, we are all brothers and sisters. We carry a torch, a torch of fundamental and profound truth. It is our hope, and I know it is your hope, that others might follow this way and enter in time into the Celestial Kingdom. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
