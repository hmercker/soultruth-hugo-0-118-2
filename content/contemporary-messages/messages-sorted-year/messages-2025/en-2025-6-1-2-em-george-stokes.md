# You Have So Much to Look Forward To

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

Joyous children of God. I come from the Celestial Heavens, where my brothers and sisters and I rejoice in God's Love every moment of our existence. We come to join you in this prayer, for we do love God and we do love to pray to God and receive His Divine Love and His blessings and His Truth.

You see, even now, as we are in Celestial spheres, we receive truth to continue our progression. You also will join us in the future in these spheres that are the embodiment of God's Divine Love. You will come to know the joy, the gratitude and the love that we share as being at one with our Heavenly Father, who is the Source of all Love and of all of creation. You have much to look forward to and you will get here one step at a time, firmly planted upon the path that you walk toward God.

So we uplift you now and bring you closer, closer to God's fountainhead of Love, that you may drink freely of His Love, feel His comfort, know the joy that comes with being at one with our Heavenly Father. Grow in your faith, dear children. Come to know that you are safe, that you are cared for and your souls continue to brighten with His Love.

I am George and I join you in this prayer, for it is the Love of my Father that I join you and support you, as do many who have come here. May God bless you and may you be open to all of His blessings. You are my brothers and sisters in this Love and my love for you grows with every prayer. God bless you.
