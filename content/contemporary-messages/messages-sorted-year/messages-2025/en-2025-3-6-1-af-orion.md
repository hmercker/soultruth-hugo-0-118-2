# You Have Chosen to Learn from All Your Trials and Tribulations

I am Orion. From my observations, I would say the trials and tribulations have always been a part of your life on Earth, even from the beginning. Yet, this is how you have chosen to learn and to grow. Those who seek to be with the highest passage of life grow the most, especially when the wisdom of the soul is ignited by the Essence of God.

You are all blessed, beloved friends, with the challenges of life. Of course, it is not easy. It does not often make for a peaceful life, but it makes for a life well-lived, full of many surprises, twists and turns, conditions and individuals that challenge you. If you were not challenged, if life were so easy, such a flow, would you be in prayer very often?

I often observe that when your prayers are intense, it usually reflects some difficulty in your life, or some individual whom you love who is having difficulties and suffering. The human way, at least on this planet, is the way of pain, suffering, challenges and difficulties. Yet, when you overcome these things and you do so by exercising your faith, your prayers, your reasoning powers and the wisdom of your soul, then do you not feel fulfilled by this? Do you not see that God is providing the answers? God is guiding you. Indeed, God protects you from the very worst of the human condition.

Often, what you create in struggle reflects issues, mindsets and biases that you have inherited and that, in your childhood, have caused you pain and lack of love. Yet, you have persisted toward light. You continue to seek out that which is of light and harmony. There is always the optimism, the desire and the goal that you will be in light. This is truly your soul speaking, expressing that desire to be in greater harmony.

This too challenges your mind. As you persist in your patterns, you create conditions that cause disruptions, whether that be psychologically, physically or spiritually. The mind continues to find ways and means of asserting itself and causing disharmony. At times, the mind works with you and your process of unravelling disharmony and creating harmony. This is the proper functioning of the material mind at its best. Yet, when your emotions, memories, thoughts and judgments come into play, then your journey through life becomes complicated by these elements that are living within you.

As you continue to grow in the Father's Love, as you continue to awaken in this Love, your soul seeking predominance, then the workings of the mind will not be so great, nor will they be listened to so often. You will find peace, that which you are seeking, the light and harmony that God wishes for you to have. This is escalating, this process of unravelling and dispersing the mindful conditions of the past. You are finding greater peace. You are expressing greater wisdom and determination to be in the light and to be in harmony.

It is important that you are aware of the journey toward this goal, that each day you consider your thoughts and your actions so that they are in greater harmony with what you know to be true, what is of God, God's creation and Laws of Love. Yes, the higher road is needed always, with every step and every breath. If you are to be those instruments that you are destined to be, if you are to be those lights that you are becoming, then greater attention is needed to change the patterns of your life, to augment your efforts to love, bringing in the Divine Love into everything, into all that you express in the world and letting go of those conditions that are not in harmony.

I know you are aware of them. As you think and utter things that you know are out of harmony, often, you reprimand yourself, feel guilt and add to the litany of your sense of inadequacies. This is not the way. This is the way of the mind. The way of the soul is forgiveness. The way of the soul is an attempt to correct, to ameliorate those wisps of darkness that befall your thinking and doing. This is how you must meet your challenges, not in judgment, not in negative, reprimanding, guilt-ridden thoughts, but in joy.

Can you turn these things into joy? Can you laugh at yourself when you make these missteps and say, *“I will do better next time. For I am a child of God and the soul that God has given me is a beautiful, pure and lovely creation of my being. I will acknowledge and nurture this part of myself. In this, I will have the strength, the capacity and the tenacity to not allow these missteps of judgment and feelings of debasement.”*

No, my beloved friends, there are two parts of you operating. When you give the credibility to your soul, the power to your soul, then these mindful operations will have nowhere to go and will not be such a crucial part of your day. Instead, the beauty and joy of your soul, the wisdom and perceptions of your soul, the loving aspects and expression of your soul, will be predominant. The mind will quickly, given the opportunity, find its place in harmony with your being.

It is a harsh lesson, I know. It is a lesson that humanity has been encountering for millennia. You must break the chain. You must show the way. You must be the light in the darkness, the wisdom in the ignorance and the joy in the pain. Can you do this, beloved souls? Along the road of spiritual progression, these things must be addressed. These issues must be dealt with. These patterns must disappear. We are with you to help you, beloved souls. We are there in our loving aspects and light to uphold you and uphold your soul which struggles with these conditions of which I have spoken. Be true to yourself and have faith in us, your angel friends, those bright spirits and your friends on Earth. So much is arrayed around you to help you and uplift you. Yet, you must make the choice. Ultimately, you must travel the road, and you must make the effort. There is no other way. This is the only way that God has provided for your own progression, or for any soul to progress.

I urge you forward. I am not suggesting that you are living in a quagmire of negativity, not by any means. Yet, you continue to speak of elevation toward the higher way. Thus, I speak of the way in which this must be accomplished. Prayer is the foundation, but also effort, conscious effort, in changing the patterns of the mind. For the mind is subject to discipline when discipline is applied. When it is not applied, it runs amok with its own ways, desires and power to control. The choice is yours, beloveds. It always has been and always will be. God provides support and Love, upliftment and insight, so that you may travel this road, not alone, but with many to help you.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Orion. I love each one of you. I have deep compassion for your struggles. I will be there in support, in light and love and hopefully bring some wisdom to your conscious self. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you all.
