# Reconcile Your Soul With God

May 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Moses received by Al Fike

Reconcile yourselves with God, dear and beloved souls of Earth. I am Moses. I come to urge you to be with your Creator, to seek out His blessings of Love and to be in harmony with all that God has created, for there is no other true solution to the dilemmas that humanity faces. You have tried to bring solutions and you have great knowledge on your earthly plane. Yet, is there harmony? Is there peace? Is there love? Indeed, these things must come to the Earth, for the Earth is meant to express and to be enfolded in these conditions. God will bring harmony, peace and love to the world, but God cannot bring that to humanity, for He has given you a great gift, the gift of free will. You must seek it out. You must come to know what true harmony is, what true peace is and what true love is.

When you can be in that condition, you know that you are close to God, close to God's creation and your own creation. The soul knows. The soul is quite capable of understanding and living by these things that I speak of. Yet, because you are split between the soul awareness and mindful concerns, it is difficult for you to recognise and delineate between these two parts. Often it is the mindful, wilful part of your being that wins out, that is not reconciled with God but often in conflict with God, not because you consciously are in that state, but because you are unconscious and in that state of conflict. It is through being conscious, through being aware of your true self, your soul, that you may come closer to God and closer to harmony, that you may truly understand what peace is and be in that state of peace.

Seek out God, beautiful souls of Earth. Seek out His blessings of Love, the Essence of His great Soul, and you will find yourself on a road that will bring you greater joy, greater wisdom and greater peace. It is your choice. It is the expression of your will that determines what road you might travel and how you may experience life. Though often, there are those who would blame God for all the injustices, all the pain and suffering in your world. In truth, unless humanity takes responsibility, understands the power that they carry and what their choices will bring in their lives, they will not truly understand what God created them for and what life is meant to be. They must come to know their own souls and the power therein. In that recognition that also comes with humility, there will be a reconciliation between you and God and you will find great purpose in your life, great meaning and great love.

It comes on the heels of your desires and your efforts to be with God. It comes with your recognition of what God has placed within you, the gifts, faculties and powers that are yours. With this understanding, my hope is there will come a sense of reverence and responsibility to govern yourselves in such a way that you are in the light, that you are indeed close to God, that you indeed love yourself and love your brothers and sisters. It is not that difficult, but it requires the stamina and persistence of a soul that needs to be recognised in a conscious way and that insists upon this recognition.

When you can do this, you can allow yourself the luxury of embracing your true self and putting aside the error that so many have taught you, explaining who you are but not truly knowing who you are. They are your false teachers. You must listen to the teaching within you, that of your soul, for your soul has much to share, much to give and much to perceive. In this way, you open the channel between you and God so that God may teach you the Truth and God may show you the way. Allow yourself to be open and receptive in this deep, profound way that is of the soul. All that you require and all that you desire that is of God and is of harmony with God's creation and the Laws of Love, will be yours, not only for the moment, but for all eternity.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Moses and I come yet again to tell you profound truths, truths that can save your life and bring your life into great light and harmony. It begins with love and ends with love, for it is all about love. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. Moses loves you. God bless you.
