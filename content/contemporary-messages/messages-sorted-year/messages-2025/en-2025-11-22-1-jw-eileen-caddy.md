Creating Sanctuary Group, Nashville, TN, USA

Eileen Caddy received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, your sister, Eileen.

May the love of God be upon you, and your souls be in His will. Those of you who know of my struggles and of my successes surely know that I persisted, and I prayed, and the answers came to my questions, and the groundwork and foundations of what became a sanctuary, and a community were developed.

Do not be discouraged, for these desires that you have to create sustainable places of refuge, your Divine Love sanctuaries, these desires are real and true, but you must realize that many cannot visualize or even see what is coming from their comfort zones. As you continue to discuss and formulate ideas, things will begin to manifest in beautiful ways. You may start with one place, one experiment, just as you would ask someone to do the Divine Love experiment, to ask God to receive. We ask you, in God’s love, to experiment with your ideas, with your visions, however small, however large, in whatever place you feel guided.

Those of us here, who mightily support you and your efforts, will always be with you to assist, to help, encourage, and influence those who wish to join you, but you must take the first step. Invite all and see who comes. I feel you will be quite surprised and pleased once you put forth a time and a place, and I say this with a greater meaning that there will be many times and many places in the years to come.

So, again, I ask you, be not discouraged. Have faith. Trust in each other and in the guidance that you have been given, co-creating with us a future that will embrace the many, though you are starting with the few. Be of good cheer, for all is well in the love of God. May His love bless you, through and through.

I am your sister in Christ, Auntie Eileen, Eileen Caddy.
