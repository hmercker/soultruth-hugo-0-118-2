Jesus received by Al Fike

May the peace that passes all understanding be yours, my beloved brethren. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you, to be with you in the Light of God's grace, God's blessing, His Holy Spirit pouring His Love within your soul. As you pray for this gift, so you long for awakening, for transformation, for love to be the predominant force and expression in your life, not merely the human love, the mortal love, but God's Love as well, that which is of the divine.

When love reigns supreme within your being and your expression, then you become an active agent for God in the world. You are His instruments of light, His channels of Love. We all pray to receive ever greater quantities of His Love, a gift that shall never end. For the eternity of your life, it shall be present and continue to uphold you and inflow into you. You begin this journey now while on the earthly plane, giving you something powerful and beautiful that shall sustain you as you live in the mortal flesh and in the spirit. Eventually, as you enter into the Celestial Kingdom, this Love shall sustain you and this Love shall transform you, your soul awakening with each day to the wonderment of this blessing. Your consciousness grows in Love. You become truly in alignment with what you are meant to be, all that is within you growing that potential that God has placed within your soul, awakening the faculties, the capacities of the soul, seeking fruition and expression.

Each of you, beloved souls, is a unique and profoundly wonderful creation of God. Each of you, on your journey toward at-onement with God, shall discover how truly magnificent you are, awesome in scope, your soul as it grows in Love, gestating and maturing, becoming what you are meant to be. Each of you shall find the fulfilment that your soul longs for. Each of you will know God as a deep and abiding Heavenly Father who loves you so. We all share this awareness and this experience. This makes us brothers and sisters. We are a part of this family of God, children of God. We shall walk upon this path together, hand in hand. We shall progress toward light and enlightenment, toward truth and the depth of truth that shall govern our lives and guide us through and to know Love that is of this quality and magnificence that can only come from God. Yet, in God's beautiful and compassionate way, He has ensured that we will know His Love and carry it within us forever.

How blessed we are to know this Truth. How wonderful is the gift of life and the potentials that come with this gift. May you sound the depths of your souls, beloveds, and come to understand its complexities and beauty. In the journey of awakening, may you be a light in the world, helping to ignite others in their awakening, in their journey. God gives all to us, all that we require in order to fulfil our destinies, to be in the light and to know at-onement with our Creator. How blessed we are, my beloveds. I come to assure you that you are on the Path Divine, the highest path of all that shall bring you to the greatest of blessings, awakenings and knowings that are of the soul. We journey together, my beloveds. I know each and every one of you. I know you. I walk with you and I love you. We are truly bonded in this Love and shall be for all eternity.

God bless you, my beloveds. God bless you in the Truth of God's Love. God bless you in the peace that passes all understanding. God bless you in the Truth that shall shine within you and be expressed through you. God bless you in the joy that comes with knowing your Heavenly Father and experiencing the vastness of Truth, Love and Light. We are one in this pursuit and we are truly bonded in Love. God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come in prayer, love and light to be with you this hour. God bless you, beloveds. I love you all. God bless you.
