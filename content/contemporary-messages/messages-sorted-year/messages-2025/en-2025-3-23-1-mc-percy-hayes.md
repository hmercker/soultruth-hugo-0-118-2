Percy Hayes received by Maureen Cardoso

My dear friends, I am Percy Hayes. How wonderful it is to have the opportunity to speak with each of you and to have myself heard in the broader community. My dear friends, whom I know, many of you, I want you to know that I pray with you. I pray for you. I continue to watch over you.

What a great joy it is to speak through this dear soul, for it was my great pleasure to be able to introduce her to the teachings that Jesus brought through thousands of years ago, to share with her the knowledge of God's Love, how to receive it and to gently observe her way, as she has come to grow in the Divine Love. It is the first time that I have spoken through her since my transition into spirit. I come to let you know the great, great joy that I experience as a Celestial Angel, the Love that I have in my soul, my soul's development, the many ways that I have been able to continue to grow in the teachings of truth and have been able to explore my purpose now that I am in the spirit world.

I can tell you that I help those souls in some of the hells. I have always been drawn to help the less fortunate. In the spirit world, the less fortunate are those who are not aware of their fortune in God's Love. I join with others in this band of work, where we visit those in the lower realms, bringing our light in the hope that we may help them out of their darkness and bring them hope. As they gravitate towards our light, they are willing to be guided. I visit with these dear souls who have the potential to become a true child of God. As a child of God, I long to be able to help all of God's children. These are my brothers and sisters, just as you are my brothers and sisters.

That is a part of my purpose and the work that I engage in. I am also part of your global healing experience, where you gather together in the realms of healing, opening yourselves as a collective and inviting in the blessings of God's Love and the presence of the angels to come and minister to you, to your human condition, which is not in harmony. I am very happy to be a part of this, for I know many of you. When you come into this place with the intention of really allowing God to bless you with healing, the healing of the soul by His Love coming in, the healing of the energies around you, within your spirit body and your physical body, there are many that join and serve as you come together. I felt it important to let you know how invested I am in each of your healings and your progression. I do what I can to be around you.

There are also services that I do with my mate, my dear Phyllis, where she and I work in spirit together. We are soulmates, and we have a purpose in helping other soulmates find each other. That is a beautiful work and a wonderful opportunity to be blessed with. Knowing my mate as I did on Earth, we were mightily blessed, for there was a love within the soul that was deep and pure, beyond what you know as human love, and had a unique purpose of its own.

We have been blessed to know each other for a very long time. As she transitioned before me, she carried on her journey, but I am happy to say that I have reached a level in my development where we are with one another, and that is beyond the expression of joy. There really are no words that can be expressed to help you understand this. I used to read in the Padgett messages, where they would tell us that it was not possible to put together into words what would describe the Celestial Spheres. Now, I am telling you that very thing because it is true. Your language does not have the compatibility to be able to share with you what it is truly like in the spheres of the Celestial Heavens.

Continue to pray, dear ones, for that is how you progress and strengthen your ability to pray deeply, with sincerity and deep longings. As you do, you will be mightily blessed, for any strong, deep longing and yearning for God's Love to touch you will be answered. Those days and times when your longings and your yearnings are a little lukewarm, they are also answered, but they are answered in accordance with what you can receive and what you truly desire. God's Love does not flow more powerfully or less powerfully. God's Love is constant. What determines the amount of Love that can flow in is you, beloveds, always you. Let that be great news, because you know that it lies within you to be able to open the tap, to open yourself to that great inflowing.

I am happy to be with you. I am in such a beautiful place, a place each one of you has awaiting you as you continue to progress in your soul. I hope I can inspire you to continue allowing your soul to grow, develop, and brighten in God's Love. I say a special hello to all those whom I knew while I walked the Earth. My love is for all of you, for I am now in a place that has absolutely no judgement. I can only love. I can only help. I want to tell you that being free from the human-conditioned love is so wonderful, for this is the freedom that my soul has long desired, to purely be radiant love unto all. That, dear friends, is what I am and what is ahead of all of you.

I am Percy. Percy Hayes, so happy to come and spend a little time with each of you as you pray for the inflowing of God's Love. God bless you all.
