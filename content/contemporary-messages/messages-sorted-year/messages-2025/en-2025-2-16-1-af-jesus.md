Jesus received by Al Fike

â€¦of truth. We ask that God might bless us with His Love. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you this day, to be with you in holy communion with your Heavenly Father and to walk the road of truth together.

I am very pleased that there are individual souls who reside in many places in your world who come together with this unified prayer and desire to receive the great gift of the Father's Love. Each of you represents an ember of truth that you are sustaining with prayer, an ember which will, in time, catch and become a flame of truth, not only for yourselves but for those parts of the world in which you reside.

We are working diligently to help influence and to bring many souls to this truth. It is indeed a great plan, a plan that the Father has for His children, to uplift and redeem, to heal and to bring peace. This is what is meant for your world and for all worlds, the worlds in spirit and the worlds in the universe. All worlds are meant to be at peace and to know the peace that passes all understanding.

You are a part of this, beloved souls. Each one of you I know by name. Each one of you I have prayed that you may be blessed. I have been with you in your prayers. Each one of you is my brother and sister who brings the Truth of God's Love to the world. For with your souls expanding in this Love, as it grows ever more in light, you become the harbingers of truth. You feed the flame of truth. You are the example of truth. Thus, you are precious to me and you are precious to God.

God wants every soul to know the existence of this blessing. No matter their faith, their religion, their attitudes or their life, they have the possibility of receiving this gift. It is important that you bring this gift forward and proclaim it. Say that it is your own, that you possess it and that you are a witness, a testimony to the power of this gift in the world and within you. Beloved souls, it requires your efforts, stepping forward, proclaiming and witnessing to the Truth of the Father's Love. Nothing more is needed. There is no dogma. There are no teachings that are necessary for the individual to know of this Truth and to subscribe to this Truth. The simple words, the simple testimony, is all that is required. In this way, the individual has the opportunity to either explore and accept this Truth or to reject it.

Nothing more is needed, beloved souls. Indeed, it is a great boon when they join you in prayer and when these Circles of Light become stronger and more populated with dear and dedicated souls seeking together this blessing. This too is a great boon to the world when these Circles of Light continue to thrive and grow. I would encourage you to gather souls together, to pray together and to be in the blessing and the grace of God's Love together.

I did this when I was on Earth and I encourage you to do the same, for the Earth is in such great need of your blessing, love, encouragement, truth and your instrumentality as a channel of love for God. These things will go a long way in transforming the world. Indeed, the world is on the cusp of great transformation, but the more that others are prepared and see beyond their own limited minds and needs for material gratification, then they too shall be ready to embrace the new world that comes, the blessings that are awaiting for each individual.

You are truly loved by God. You are truly loved by us. You have the key to the Kingdom. You have the road that shall bring you there. You have all that you require, beloved souls. Walk with me. Walk with your angel friends and seek this great blessing of Love. All that you require, all that you seek, all the questions that you may have, all the yearnings of your soul that cry out from deep within, these things shall be blessed, answered and awakened within you through the great gift of the Father's Love. You need no more than this, beloved souls. You shall be healed and redeemed in this blessing. No other blessing can do this for you. No other truth can bring you to this place of true knowing and experiencing the Touch of God within your soul.

I urge you to continue in your dedications, to continue to seek the truth in love and to express the truth in love wherever you go. Whatever situation you find yourself in, beloved souls, bring the Love of God into it. Express the Love of God that is inhabiting your soul at this moment forward and as a blessing, a beautiful gift to your brothers and sisters, to yourself and to your families. You are truly, truly upon the road divine, the highest blessing of all given. Express these things and you shall know joy. Live these things and you shall be empowered in love. Speak these things and God will bless you so.

My beloveds, I continue to lead you forward. I am with you. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom. I have my hand upon each one of you as a blessing and a comfort. God is blessing all of us at this moment. A great Light descends upon you, beloveds, a great Light that is affecting and influencing the world because you have prayed for this great gift. God bless you. My love is with you always. I love you always. God bless you, beloved souls of truth.
