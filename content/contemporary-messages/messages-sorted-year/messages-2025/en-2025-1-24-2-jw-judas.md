Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother, Judas. My dear friends, in these troubled times, I know you often feel pulled in one direction or another, trying to balance your life, your struggles, your human condition with your spiritual life. This, at times, can seem like a dual existence, a type of spiritual schizophrenia, where one is dealing with family or work, politics, distractions, all the things reaching out there to you and your responsibilities, or shall I say, your ability to respond, coupled with your deep desires to be changed. Even in spiritual practice, there can be a type of somnambulance, a wish to be comforted by routine and ritual, the very things that initially promote awakening can become less than alive, and the heart’s desire is to be alive, to feel the freedom from the world while living in it. Thus, here is the conundrum. You may wonder if even these things that are designed to awaken me and help me to progress, to be in the love of God, can turn into an empty ritual, how can I proceed? How can I grow? How can I be in this world and not of it? The longings of your souls when they are true, bring the presence of God and the love of God into your soul. You might say you have one foot in heaven, in the kingdom, and the other trying to navigate the many levels of earth life.

First and foremost, I suggest that you not be troubled by this dichotomy, this duality, but simply take it on as a challenge to awaken, for the struggle is awakening. This challenge creates a response to be in grace, a calling out to God, and sometimes it is, “Dear God, how I have fallen out of harmony today. I seemed to be doing so well, and something knocked me off my joy. Please restore this connection”. And this is what a prayer is endeavoring to accomplish: a connection of the soul with its Creator. One that grows and strengthens over time, one that I can assure you will become a part of your very being where rituals and routines are no longer necessary. So, allow the challenge to power your prayers, to engage you, not against the world, but above it and yet embracing it. True prayer brings compassion and empathy, even to the extent of being able to love and forgive one’s enemies. For, when one soul is in a condition of love and light, in at-onement, there are no enemies, there are only souls, all children of God.

It is our wish for you to follow your heart, and follow your unique path, each one a precious soul with very beautiful gifts, each one being able to assist the other when you come together in the love of God, and you lift each other up, you allow each one to be healed, and you send out this light, this love to a world so in need.

I thank you for your commitment, for your prayers to God, for your connection with all of us, and for your persistence. All these things will bring rewards beyond your imagination, and they are real. May God bless you, each one. I thank you. I am your brother in Christ, a disciple of the Master, and a redeemed soul.

I am Judas. Go in peace.
