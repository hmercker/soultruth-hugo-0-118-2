Orion received by Al Fike

May the peace that passes all understanding be yours, my friends. I am Orion. I am happy with the outcomes of our sessions and with your efforts to be bonded in light, to continue to forge this relationship together and to create greater harmony amongst you. Any movement, any effort that involves human interest and human activity starts with a solid team of players, those who are willing to lead and those who are willing to support one another in that leadership and those who are true to the divine purpose and plan.

You have acknowledged with one another a desire to do so. You continue to find your way upon the path. You will continue to open to the clarity that is God's Will and God's purpose for each of you. There is much work to do, as you well know. There is travel. There are publications. There are Circles of Light. There are efforts to be made while there is still time to utilise the technologies and situations on this Earth plane of yours that will allow the communications more readily, the travel and the time together.

I urge you, my beautiful friends, to continue to act with purpose, desire and dedication, to listen with your soul and to understand as you listen, as you come to realise God's purpose for you, the opening of your gifts, faculties of the soul expressed through your being in a clarity, in a power, in a light that is of your soul manifest into this world. There is so much for you to do, beloved and beautiful friends. There is indeed a plan. Our challenge and the challenge of your Celestial friends and the bright spirits is to penetrate the conditions of your world and to penetrate the conditions of your inner world, so that you will come to know and understand what it is that you must do, what it is you are capable of doing and the timing of that expression and purpose in the world.

I thank you for allowing me into your circle and for discussing my appearance. Indeed, I had a good laugh seeing what your technologies might assume is my appearance. Yet, there are similarities in some of these pictures that you presented. You will continue to work and refine and find that image that is appropriate. I will help. I will affirm when there is something more accurate in the depictions. I am happy that you think of me, that you respect my appearance and wish for it to be accurate.

All of these influences, all of these beautiful spirits, angels, beings of light, that crowd around you, I know it is difficult at times to recognise, to acknowledge, what is happening on this side of life, the spirit that surrounds you. When you gain clarity, it helps. It assists you in your rapport, your closeness to us, to all of us. It is not a waste of time. It is something that is important for many. You live on a material plane, so having material things that will help you to recognise and to gain a closer rapport with us is important indeed.

It is a beautiful blessing and gift to make these efforts, to establish a firm rapport, to understand that we are indeed real and that we do indeed wish for us to be more real in your consciousness, in your efforts together, that we may communicate clearly, that we may work together powerfully and that the Love may bond us more intensely. Harmony comes in many ways, my friends. Harmony is expressed in many ways. We are eager to build harmony and to express harmony. We will together continue in this work to uplift humanity, to help in the great shift of consciousness that humanity must engage within in order to have greater harmony upon your world. We are definitely with you and are greatly dedicated to the work. We love each one of you and all who are eager to bring harmony to your world.

Blessings to you, my friends. I am Orion. My love is with you always. I am close, closer than you might think. I am close. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
