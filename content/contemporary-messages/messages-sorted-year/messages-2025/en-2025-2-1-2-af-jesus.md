# Implores Us to Seek the Light for Our Souls and For Our Families

February 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025

San Salvador Estate, Trinidad

Jesus received by Al Fike

The world needs you, beloved souls. The world is in trouble, in turmoil and in darkness. So, when you think of yourselves and your needs, think of what it can be like if every soul upon your world could adopt love as their expression and light. I come to you, my beloved souls, brothers and sisters all. I am your brother, Jesus. I come to you to implore you to seek light for yourselves, for your soul and to seek to be a light in your communities and your families. For this is what God needs of you and this is what the world needs of you.

To build the light within you is to seek the great blessing of the Love of God. To walk in the world as God's instruments requires this gift to empower you in the ways of the spirit, to bring you in alignment with God's Will. The gift of His Love will open the passageways of understanding and gifts that are of your soul. That way, whatever progress you make in your life will have its permanent benefit to you. Whether you be in the material world or the spirit world, you will progress in light, and it is light that brings progress.

The brightest light of all, the purest blessing of all, the highest gift of all, is the gift of the Father's Essence entering your soul, bringing you to that place of at-onement. My beloveds, each of you seeks the truth. Each of you has curiosity and a desire to find your way in a world so diffused in distraction and where the truth is obscured by many, many things. You seek the clarity of truth. You seek to know. Indeed, your soul desires to live in the blessing and grace of God.

Seek your way to God, beloved souls. Be blessed in this prayer and desire to know your Creator and to know your true self, your purpose and meaning in this world. This way, the deep questions that you have will be answered, will be blessed with wisdom and will be blessed with love. Do not tarry in this desire and journey toward truth but seek it and live it as best you can. As has been said before, those who seek the truth will find the glories of Heaven and will come to that place of great joy, knowledge and peace. God gives this to you freely, beloved souls. God does not withhold anything. I compel you, I urge you, to seek it. For as you seek, you will find. As you knock on that door, it shall open.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, in the beautiful grace of God, His Love for you powerful and palpable, that will bring all that you require as you walk the world. As you seek truth, it is given. It is given. May you be blessed in all that is of God, all that is of goodness, light and grace. I am with you on your journey. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I am Master of the Celestial Kingdom. May you be blessed as I have indicated and seek that you might receive in all its glory. God bless you. I love you, each one. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you in Love.
