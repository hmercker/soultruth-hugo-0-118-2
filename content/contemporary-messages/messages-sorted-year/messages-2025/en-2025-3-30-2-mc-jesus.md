# Open Your Souls to the Inflowing of Divine Love

March 30<sup>th</sup>, 2025

First United Spiritual Church, Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am Jesus. My brothers and sisters, open yourselves as you have been guided to open your soul and to feel the resonance of your soul and the inflowing of the Creator Substance into you.

This is what I came upon Earth to teach. This is the truth of my message. This is the message I was given to bring to Earth, so that all humanity could know that this blessing of Divine Love was once again available to them. Equality in Essence, the very Substance of the One who has created you, created all of us and created the entire universe, was now returned in this offering, a gift, available to all who should ask and given in accordance with your desire.

Your world is transforming, as you all know. You desire for love to reign in the world. This is what we all desire. We come to love you, to bless you, to support you and to guide you. There is no greater truth that can be received and taught in all the universe. This is the highest Truth. This is the highest gift. It is given freely. As you allow this Love to come into you and choose of your own free will to receive this blessing, our Heavenly Father, our Maker, the Creator of all things shall bless you, shall flow into you to heal you and to love you, a Love that has no barriers, that is all-giving, that is transforming and will make you anew.

The stony heart that may reside within you shall become new, shall become one of love, a love that can only give and a love that is unconditional. This Substance of God, as you receive it, makes you such. My brothers and sisters, if you can take away anything from this moment, it is to know that God is Love, that love is the true reality, that you are made of love, and you are love. This Love will elevate you and your soul and your spirit into the eternal realms, should you only continue to ask and allow it to transform you.

I bless you. I love you. I walk with you. You are cared for. You are protected. May you take in this peace that passes all understanding and allow yourself to be at one in this moment with your Creator. I am Jesus. God bless you.
