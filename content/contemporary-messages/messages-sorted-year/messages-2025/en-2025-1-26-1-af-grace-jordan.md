# Expresses Her Gratitude for the Starpoint Retreat

January 26<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Starpoint Retreat, Christ Church, Barbados

Grace Jordan received by Al Fike

I am Grace. I come to thank you for joining us in prayer, for seeking out truth and for your efforts to be a light in the world. Each of you has your own unique way of doing that. I want to encourage you to discover, to develop and to express all the ways that you can to be a light in the world.

For God has many tasks for His children. God has much for you to do and there are many tasks that are begging to be done. Open your eyes, open your hearts and open your souls. Look to see what God wishes for you to do and be, to be that channel of love in the world, to work for the benefit of others, to walk in the light of truth, to be all these things that are truly of you and to express all those things that are unique to you.

It is a big, wide world out there that needs each of you. It requires your dedications, your commitments and your love. It requires all these beautiful things within you. God will guide you. God will protect you. It is for you to see your way through, to be that light for God and to bring God's blessing through you to others.

Thank you, beloved souls, for your time. Thank you for your contributions. Thank you for all you do and all that you are. We will continue in our progress. My hope is that the Circle of Light in Barbados will grow, strengthen and be a beautiful catalyst for change in this country. I will be with you. Many will be with you. Be strong and be true to your soulâ€™s desires, God's Will and all that is His Love, and you will bring great change to this place. You are strong and you are of light.

God bless you, beloved friends. I am Grace. I love you. Each of you, I love you. I will be with you. Know this. Have faith in this. Have faith in God and you will be those beautiful instruments that you are meant to be. God bless you. God bless you all.
