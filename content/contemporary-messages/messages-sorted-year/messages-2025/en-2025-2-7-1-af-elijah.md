# Comes to Affirm Life and Reinforce Truth

February 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Elijah received by Al Fike

Blessings to all of you on the Earth plane. I am Elijah. I come to affirm life. For it is the gift of life that God gave this Earth and all within it that has sustained and brought greater life. Though all of humanity continues to neglect this fact, they are a part of the whole of the great existence of Earth. They are a vital part, a part with great power to exercise decisions and choices upon the Earth, that the Earth may indeed be a victim or a beneficiary of human endeavour.

What other creature upon the Earth is able to make those choices, is able to do as it will upon this planet? All other creatures, all other life, live in accordance with the plan, the rhythms and flow that God has created for this planet. Yet, you carry the blessing and the burden of choice. What is upon your Earth at this very time is the result of your efforts, your thoughts and your deeds. For what other creature is so powerful? What other creature has the ability to change, even to rend asunder that which God has created?

Though humanity believes itself to be God, at least in terms of the desire to exert its will upon the Earth, humanity is but a child, ignorant and without clear direction, merely wishing to express and fulfil its desires, its efforts to bring about all that it is in tune regarding those things of the flesh, those things that bring pleasure, those things that bring power, those things that bring a sense of belonging to the Earth and owning the Earth. Unfortunately, these things are not a reflection of the soul and the soulâ€™s wisdom. These things are of the mindful desires and desires of the flesh.

Thus, a great inequity has been created, an  imbalance on the earthly plane that continues to cause great suffering in the world. Are you a part of this? Those who are listening to me now, those who may listen to me at other times, are you a part of this? Invariably, you are. Invariably, because you are human and mortal, you have your part to play. Yet, because you have free will, you may choose to play that part in harmony with God's creation or out of harmony with God's creation.  Which is it, my friends? Which is it? It is an important question, a question that shall influence and determine your existence upon this planet. For as you join the masses who are woefully ignorant and cannot see, feel or hear the pain that you have all inflicted upon your Mother Earth, you are responsible. You are part of that dark force that continues to attack this beautiful Earth.

Or are you the ones of light who are opening your eyes and seeing with intensity and horror the actions of men upon the creation of God? If your eyes are open, if you see and you see with integrity and honesty, then indeed your feelings and reactions are that of disdain, disillusionment and deep concern. For if you are of God, if you are in harmony with God and God's creation, then there must be love and harmony in your actions and life upon the Earth. I do not encourage you to have judgment about your brothers and sisters, for this judgment continues to add to the darkness and to the horror. Rather, to have love, love for yourself, love for your brothers and sisters and love for this Earth. For it is love that will heal and love that will bring harmony.

Even though you may see clearly, even though you may see within your own life those actions and attitudes that take from the Earth rather than give to the Earth, I urge you to have compassion for yourself, compassion for all that is on this Earth and to do what you might to bring harmony and peace to yourselves and to this world. You are intertwined with all that humanity is upon this Earth. In this intertwining arrangement, this connection with all, I urge you to pray to be a light, so that light may spread out through the Lattice of Light on this Earth and act as an agent of blessing, an agent of wisdom and an agent of love for this world.

If you can do this, beloved souls, God will do the rest. God will utilise you as His agents to bring blessings to the world. It is for you to not only see the truth with clarity and with an eye of wisdom, but also to act with integrity and love as you walk upon this earthly plane and be that true agent for God. Nothing else will help. Nothing else will truly be an agent to change the world. Things have gone too far, my friends. It is sad but true that the world is populated by the hungry, the innocent, the ignorant and the blind as they move in the world, captured by the rhythms and conditions created by those in power. We have great compassion, for many are suffering upon the world. Many are ignorant of their actions. There are those truly dark souls who continue to manipulate and use the world to their advantage and are completely ignorant of the consequences of their actions.

Unfortunately, they will pay the piper, as you would say, in time. Indeed, all humanity will pay the price for its ignorance and its lack of love for this world. You must be strong pillars of light to help hold those that are coming to the realisation, to the awakening of truth, that they may be drawn toward you and that you may help them see. There is so much to be seen, known and understood and so few to give the answers. We are with you, beloved souls. We are with you as you continue to struggle in your own way toward greater light. We love you, each one of you, beautiful souls, beautiful children of God. We love you. God loves you. You are not alone in your struggles and your efforts toward light, never, beloveds, never.

May you be blessed. May you continue to open your eyes to truth. May you continue to find peace, the peace that passes all understanding. May you continue to grow in the Father's Love, that the Truth may inflow and infill your mind and your awareness to the point that you are a formidable force for truth, a beautiful channel of love. May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Elijah. I come today to reinforce truth, to tell you how important it is to live truth and to be truth in the world. For the world is suffering and you must be an example of how to be in harmony with the creation of God. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you in Love, His great Essence flowing into your soul and bringing you the peace, the joy, the wisdom and the greater capacity to love. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
