# Worry and Concern

August 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Thursday Night Judas Group, Nashville, TN, USA

Clare of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear kind mice. How wonderful it is to come and speak to you. And I wish to tell you I wish to tell you that I’m with my dear sister, your beloved Care.

We have discussed an issue that may resonate with those here, and that is the subject of worry and the differences between worry and concern. The word concern often comes up in messages and generally has the same meaning to those listening as worry. But I should like to draw a distinction for your benefit, for worry leads to fear. Worry is also troubling and can be self-inflicted. Any, you know the expression worrywart is someone who seems to be in a constant state of worry. So when we say *"be not troubled"*, we mean don’t worry. When you are concerned, often for others or your relationship to them, it is because it is of importance to you. And right concern leads to prayer. How shall I move forward? *"Dear God, make a pathway for me or for this person I am concerned about."* Or for this issue that I do not worry, but realize in faith that You will make a way.

So, whatever your concerns are, simply bring them to God, and as you do this even more every day, they shall fade away, and you shall be walking in Faith as we do, and we shall walk with you as we do when you call. My brother here loves to mention the words of his friend Hafiz because it helps him. Those words go something like this: *"Now that worry has proved to be so unlucrative, why not find a better job?"* Of course, the deeper import of that is that worry does not lead to the solution. It does not add one iota of resolve to the problem. And in the material world as you can take your concerns and solve them in a rational manner through science or mathematics or just simple reasoning, take your soul concerns to God as well as your human concerns. For there is help in both the material and spiritual from progressive spirits and the celestial angels.

Dear God, May we walk in faith each day. May our hearts be in gratitude for the great gift of your love, for this communion and this community, and in the company of those who pray with us and stay with us, and walk with us, ever bringing us nearer to Your soul and Your grace in Faith.

My dear ones, I thank you for this time. May your prayers bless your souls with the Heavenly Father’s response. For we are all one in His love the great gift from above. I am your sister in Christ and your eternal friend in the love of God. My sister and I send you all our love. May God bless you. I am Claire. Go in Peace.
