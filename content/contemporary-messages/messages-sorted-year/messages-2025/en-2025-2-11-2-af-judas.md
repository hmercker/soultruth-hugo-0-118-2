# Realise the Power of God’s Gift of Free Will

February 11<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Judas received by Al Fike

Beloved souls of Earth, I am Judas of Kerioth. I come to speak to you about the power that you all possess. That is the power to choose, the power of free will. It is the power that no other creature on the Earth has to such an extent that each individual, each soul upon this planet, can choose to be in harmony with God's Laws or not to be in harmony.

Everything in your life is a choice. Everything is a reflection of this gift. As you carry on in your life and choose with each breath and each moment, you accumulate the results of free will, creating your destiny and the unfolding of your life. I urge you to consider the power of this gift that God has given you. I urge you to realise that all things that happen in your life are the result either of your free will choice or the free will choice of others around you, even your countries.

There are many avenues of empowerment that are the result of this gift. It is for you, beloved souls, to understand that you can countermand the choices of others through prayer and through receiving the great gift of God's Love. God's Love is the greatest gift of all, even more powerful than free will, but it must be exercised by will and by choice in order to be effective. It must come into your lives through prayer, through asking the Creator for this gift of Love.

Again, all is predicated upon the power of choice. Each must take responsibility for their lives, for this is why God gave you free will, that you may choose or not choose, that you may be a part of or not a part of, that your will and your desire, is the motivating factor in almost everything that you do in life. Of course, the body is subject to the elements of its creation and there are reflexive properties that are involved with this, but the mind is the result of choice. It is the result of allowing patterns of behaviour, patterns of perception, patterns of comprehension that make up what you call your reality.

Yet, you might choose something different, for you have the capacity to do so. We are encouraging each of you to explore this possibility, to apply your free will choices in the direction that is more in harmony with God's laws and God's Laws of Love. It cannot be manifest without your choice. It cannot truly be part of your life without your allowing it to be so and exerting the desires of your soul to the point where it influences and becomes truly an expression of your soul. When you receive the great gift of God's Love, it is up to you to have that Love expressed in every avenue of your life. This, again, is a choice. If you choose to have that expression fully awakened and influencing every part of you, then you have chosen well. You are on the right road, the right track, toward the transformation of your soul, the redemption of your being in the Truth of God's Love.

So remember, my beautiful friends, that every breath is a choice, to act, to think and to be. It is up to you to be that expression of light, love and truth, to be a channel for God, an instrument of His Will, manifest through your will, so that those around you may benefit and truly know the blessing of God's Love. You may be used to introduce this, or God may use some other form and way to introduce it. But, once it is introduced, it is up to you or anyone to accept and embrace it, or reject it. Once you have done your part, through the exercise of your will to bring this Truth to others, then you will have fulfilled God's wish and desire that this Truth be known to all men.

I encourage you to grab the reins, to be a faithful servant of God, to bring this Truth to as many as you might reach, so that every individual may have the choice to accept or reject this gift. You are blessed, beloved friends. You have accepted it and you have embraced it. May you continue to grow and expand in love, in light, in truth and be that instrument that God wishes you to be.

God bless you, my friends. I am Judas. Indeed, I discovered, in a way that was very harsh indeed, the power of free will, and how enacting free will may indeed contradict the Will of God. So be careful, be considerate and act in love. All will unfold in loving harmony when you are in the flow of God's Love. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
