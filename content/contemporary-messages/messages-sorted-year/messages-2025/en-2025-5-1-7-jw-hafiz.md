# Feast on That

May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Hafiz received by Jimbeau Walsh

That which is created in darkness  
Can look but not see 
That which is created in chaos  
Can listen but not hear

For a heart in stillness  
Awakens the senses  
And the mind steps back  
Into the soul

But perhaps all of this  
Is a bit much  
So let’s keep it simple  
Why not start  
By turning on the light  
So you can see? 
Listening to the river  
So you can hear 

Step back from the precipice of confusion  
That you may have clarity 

The wise man can walk in silence  
That his soul may hear  
Even the whispers of his Creator  
Whereas the wise women  
Is all ears from the get-go 

I wouldn’t tell you all this  
If you weren’t listening  
Seven grains of truth  
Can satisfy every hungry soul  
Feast on that!
