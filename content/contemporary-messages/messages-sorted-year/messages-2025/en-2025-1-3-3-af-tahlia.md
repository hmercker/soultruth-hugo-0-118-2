# Ask for Me for Healing Energies 

January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Tahlia received by Al Fike

I have great capacities to channel the blessings of Mother Earth and the blessings from our beloved Creator. It is a matter being attuned and aligned with your gifts to bring these blessings forth. They will benefit your body, your mind, your soul and your spirit. All these things benefit from what God must give through the various avenues and blessings of God's creation.

When you need a boost of power to be strong in energy and abilities, seeking to be God's servant, you might ask me to come. I will bring you a blessing that will uplift you and empower you. Such are my gifts. Such are what I might give. Indeed, as you pray together to ask for a blessing for Mother Earth, I am with you. I shall help empower you to be that conduit, that blessing for the beautiful Mother that sustains you.

Do not limit your thinking, yourselves and the ideas of how you might be used as a channel of light and blessings. Many of your gifts and capacities are still yet to be discovered. But, as you ask, as you open yourselves to the awareness and to the possibilities of your soul's ability to be a channel of blessings, these further and deeper gifts will become a part of you. You will learn how to use them, how to be in alignment with them and to not obstruct them.

There is still much to learn for all of you, beloved friends. But, indeed, you learn. Each day is an opportunity and a blessing for learning. Do not let a day pass by without opening yourselves to the greater awareness, the beautiful understanding and blessings that come from God and His Love. In this way, you ensure further development and awakening. Be clear, be steadfast, humble and of great faith. You will find that God will respond in many ways, through many avenues, for your blessing.

My beloved friends, I am Tahlia and I love you. I love you all, beautiful children of God, beautiful inhabitants of God's precious jewel of a planet that continues to sustain and bless you. God bless you, my friends. God bless you in Love.
