# The Impact of Your Prayers

March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Liverpool, NY, USA

Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Mary. The Mother, as you call me. I, too, come to speak truth, as did my brother, [Timothy](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2025/en-2025-3-23-2-em-timothy/). Your love combined is bright as a star. It shines upon souls you are unaware of. It shines brightly and feeds into what you call the Beacon of Light and is further sent into the Universe. My brother cannot understate the impact of your love combined.

Do pray. Do come together often. Do lift your longings and your love to our Father and shine brightly. For many, many are receiving this light in their darkness. They seek the truth that you possess. You cannot comprehend how your will and effort to pray impacts so many, but you have faith as well as love. So pray deeply, often and consistently, if possible. For this work, this work that we are all doing, is done in God's name and for the love of God, who loves all of His children.

May you all be blessed with more of this great Light that the Father desires to give to you. I am your sister, Mary. I love you dearly, each and every one of you.
