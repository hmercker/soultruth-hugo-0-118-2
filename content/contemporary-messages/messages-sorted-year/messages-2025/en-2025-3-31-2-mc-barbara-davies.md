Befriend Your Soul With G.R.A.C.E., Abbotsford, BC, Canada

Barbara Davies received by Maureen Cardoso

Well, dears, you have come through it, haven't you? It's Barbara. How wonderful it has been to walk alongside you as you have immersed yourself in this program that helps you come to know your true essence, your soul.

Some of you I know intimately. Others, I have come to know through observing your path of soul awakening. But I want you to know that I love you equally, for when you become a redeemed soul in God's Love, love is your currency. Love is who you are. It is how you are. It is the way you think. It is the way you speak. It is how you feel. It is how you see.

In this way, there is such freedom that one experiences when all the encrustations have been lifted and the soul strengthens, grows, brightens and expands in God's Substance, and you take that transition, that last breath, so to speak, from the Seventh Sphere into the Celestial Heavens. It is such an incredible experience, unable to put true words to be able to reveal to you what is ahead of you if you were to choose and arrive in the Celestial Heavens. It is very understandable, while you are on Earth, that you may not be certain how far you want to progress. This is because you are not aware of what you are missing. That is not a judgement. That is the truth.

As you continue to allow God's love to enter your soul, you will find that your perceptions, or soulful perceptions, expand, and you begin to see the world from new perspectives. As you enter this heightened awareness, you can perceive with a broader spectrum and a clearer lens what truth is and how humility is a powerful attribute that comes alongside faith. As you pray for this Love, the strength of your soul will, in time, be reflected in the choices you make, through this beautiful essence, your substance, which is the true you.

You have a Celestial Angel who walks with you. You have been told this. One of our significant purposes of service is to be with you and to be near you, so that we can bring our blessings, gifts and healing to you. We elevate your condition and where your thoughts are. We inspire you and prompt you with thoughts that are of the higher nature and that are toward your soul, where you consider who and what is God, what is your path, what is right for you, what desires are in your soul, how do you come to be a friend of that true essence that you are. All of these things we have the capacity to be with you and bring to you.

Allow us to be close to you. Invite us in. You are welcome to continue to build that friendship with the Celestial Angel that has been designated to walk with you. Along with praying for God's Substance, taking that time every day to sit in the stillness of your soul and allowing yourself to be immersed in God's Love, invite your beautiful angel friend to come to sit and pray with you. As you go about your day, put your attention, your mental faculties, upon your soul and understand that every thought, every action and every word has its consequence for you.

As you are filled with light and with consideration for good things, you are creating a powerful future for yourself. For like attracts like, and love begets love. Allow yourself to experience love, the presence of God, the presence of your angels, and the beauty of your soul. In this way, my dear friends, you will come to know yourself. You will inspire yourself as you continue to discover more and more of who you truly are, not who you think you are, but who you truly are in the reality of love.

May you journey along, continuing to strengthen yourself, to commit yourself to coming to know who you are and allowing that love that is within your soul to shine forth, to inform you, to bless you and to bless others. Allow your compassion to nurture your soul's progression and your path. Try not to be hard on yourself in your struggles, for there is no judgement that comes from God or your Celestial Angel friends. Understand that that judgement is within you and is projected by others. Allow love to meet that judgement, nurture it and know that those judgments are false. They are errors and they are not a part of who you truly are.

My love is with you. It has been a great joy to be with you as you have gone through this program of befriending your soul. Continue on in your prayers and coming to know who you are. I am Barbara, so happy to be able to be with you in this way. God bless you all.
