Barbara Davies & Eileen Caddy received by Al Fike

**Barbara:** May the blessings of God's Love infill you to overflowing. I am Barbara. I come to speak of love, how it is that God's Love, when it comes into your soul, opens up avenues, doorways and possibilities of how you might love and express love in the world. Love may be expressed in many different ways. As you are a unique soul created by God, so the uniqueness of that love expressed through you as a lens of your soul may be beautiful, creative and filled with your very imprint and capacity to express your unique self.

As you travel in the world, as you meet different people, as you converse and connect, there is a certain quality that is added to every one of these interactions. That quality is a reflection of your soul. Your soul is a reflection of God in His attributes of Love. You may walk in the world open, receptive to that connection with others, to the world itself, to nature, to animals, to many things, to the Earth. As you do so, as that channel opens in you, God will utilise you to bring those unique qualities and gifts of your soul forward, embellished and expanded by love.

I urge you, my beloved friends, to walk in the world with an attitude of love, of reverence for life, of reverence for everyone you meet, no matter the colour of their skin, their appearance, whatever it is that is unique to them. May you honour this in love. May you embrace them in love. Even though this may not be a physical embrace, may it be a spiritual embrace, that that moment that you might walk with them, it is a gift from God. In that gift from God, may you truly be in alignment with God's Will. May whatever God wishes to give to them through you, through your unique channel, may it be accomplished, may it be intense and may it even change that person's life.

God has many intentions, desires to uplift His children. God wants each and every child upon this planet to know the joy of love and the joy of life. I ask you to pray if you might be used to help fulfil that promise that God has made to His children, that in some way, you are an instrument to uplift and uphold, and with the power of love, that blessing may come through you.

You may wonder about yourself, how is it that you might be God's instrument? Yet, I tell you, beautiful souls of God, every time you receive another inflowing of God's Love, you come closer to that place of a pure and true instrument for God. Indeed, like everything, you need to practise this effort, to make an effort for yourself to be open and willing, to be a channel of love for another. When you can do this and it becomes a reflexive part of you, a part that is always open and flowing in love, then you have fulfilled your promise to God to be that light in the world and to be a beautiful channel of love in the world.

Every time you make footfalls upon the Earth, I urge you to love the Earth. Every time you see a flower, a tree, when you are in nature, have love and reverence for these things. Every time you encounter God's greatest creation, which is humankind, have reverence and love for them. No matter how dark and depreciated they are within their soul, have love, for that love may be a catalyst for change, a catalyst for God to reach that soul.

You do not necessarily have to speak to everyone, but if you speak through your soul, you are speaking to everyone. You are reaching out to everyone. When you pray, pray for the world. Pray for your loved ones. Pray for all the people in your life and all the people that you are going to meet in the future. Pray for the unborn children and those who are about to be born. Pray wherever life emerges that it comes realised in the beauty and perfection that it is meant to be. There are many ways to love and many ways to pray. I urge you to continue to express love in your prayers, especially to express love to yourself, the reverence you may have for your being, the unique creation that you are. For this is truly a magnificent creation of God. You are truly loved and your presence in the world was meant to be.

In your life, honour this. Have reverence for everything that you do and everything that you are, then you will find yourself in a place of joy and of deeper understanding of yourself. As you have greater understanding and love for yourself, you will be able to love and understand others in a deeper way. The journey that you take is a journey of soul progression, soul awakening, so that all of these faculties that you possess may be realised and awakened by the Father's Love, that you may walk this Earth with ever deeper and greater realisations, revelations, capacities to love and to serve God.

All these things come with a simple prayer, a desire to receive this great gift of Divine Love. May you seek it always, my beloved friends. May you know that in the seeking, in the gift of it coming to you, that you have set your feet upon an eternal path that will lead to at-onement with God. In this at-onement will be joy beyond realisation or your imagination. It will be a great, great expansive gift of light, joy and love. This is God. This is God's expression and blessing upon you. May you be open at these moments in prayer for an ever greater inflowing of His Love, that that inflowing may be constant and may increase in volume with each and every prayer, each and every day, as you walk in the world, a light for God.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Barbara. I am honoured to speak to you today of the ways of love, power of love, the beauty of love. God bless you. I love you. God bless you.

**Eileen:** I am glad that our friend Barbara spoke of the reverence for nature and for the Earth. This is very important now. The Earth is under attack. The Earth is out of harmony. I would urge you to pray for the sustainment and the healing of Mother Earth because each of you can be a channel for this, as well as many other things. Consider your instrumentality, the power of your soul attuned to God in relationship with your Creator. As you fulfil this destiny of being with God, utilise the gifts that are given, the channel that is created, the portal of love and light that you are for the world.

Thank you for listening to me. I am Eileen Caddy. As you grow in the Father's Love, so that portal grows. May it be powerful and beautiful, a healing agent for the world. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
