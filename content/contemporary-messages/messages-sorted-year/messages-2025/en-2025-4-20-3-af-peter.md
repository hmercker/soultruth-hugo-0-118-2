# Guidance and Affirmation to Take Jesus’ Guidance Seriously

April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Peter received by Al Fike

God bless you, I am Peter. I come to affirm the Master's designation and proclamations of truth for each of you. The Master showed his light and showed his authority [as he spoke to you](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2025/en-2025-4-20-2-af-jesus/). I come to affirm his presence and his words. I come to affirm my love for each of you and that the time is coming for you to stand forth in light.

I am Peter and I love you.
