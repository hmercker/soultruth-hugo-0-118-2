# Guidance for Estonia

March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

I urge you to open your minds to the universe of possibilities. This time together is indeed precious and rife with opportunities. I ask you to be prayerful about these things and to listen to the guidance that will be given. We will work diligently to invite, to impress and to help others to see and feel attracted to the door that is open to them.

Do not worry about material impediments or conditions. Rather, approach this with a spiritual perspective. This is a test for your soul, my beloved and beautiful children of God. As you venture forward in faith, you will find that God will answer you in your prayers and desires. God, the angels and even stellar friends will work together to help make this a success and to help expedite these opportunities and possibilities to the fullest extent.

My beloved friends, you are the vanguards to opening up the truth to many. We will indeed help in your development, the opening of your souls and the opening of your minds to what God requires of you and the possibilities that may come in your gifts and in your blessings.

May you be blessed, beautiful friends, with the inflowing of the Father's Love. May it, in time, become a constant in your life, that that flow may not cease but continue with every breath. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come with reassurance, a bit of guidance and many blessings for each of you. God bless you, beautiful, beautiful children of God.
