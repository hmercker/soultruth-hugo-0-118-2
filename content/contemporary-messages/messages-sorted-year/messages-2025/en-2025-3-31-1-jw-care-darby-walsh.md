# With God there is no Distance

March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Nashville, TN, USA

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the love of God be upon you and in you. It is I, your sister Care.

During my walk on the earth, I delighted in nature, in God’s cathedral, and I would gaze up at the heavens and on a clear night, be in awe of the firmament, knowing the trillions of stars, the vastness of Creation, and the awesomeness of our Creator. That which seems far away and so overwhelming is, in reality, present. For God is not even a hair away.

When you send out your wish to be at one with your Creator, our Heavenly Father, you do not need to use a megaphone, though at times you may cry out:

> Dear God, bring me into at-onement with You, with Your great Soul, for my heart is troubled and I have lost my way. Open up my soul to the infilling, inflowing of Your essence, Your love.

There is no distance when the soul calls out and God responds with every good and perfect gift.

So, whether you are blessed to be in nature or within the confines of an (inside) space, you may always open to the glory of the Creator of the universe, created in love as your soul is created with the great possibility of transformation. What a gift!

So, to my beloved on the celebration of his birthday and all those having birthdays, I wish you a glorious day. But to all, each and every one, we shall celebrate your new-birth day, re-born, your soul from the image to the substance, from the mortal to the immortal. Each one becoming a divine angel. This birthday will be celebrated in eternity, in the realms of the celestial heavens, and with a view unparalleled of God’s creation, born in love.

May each one here, seen and unseen, relax, allow your heart to be opened, that God may open your soul. Allow this love to come in and heal you and uplift you, awaken you, and transform you. What a wonder.

With all my love and blessings, I shall step back and be with you in this prayer.

I am your sister, in Christ. I am Care. God bless you.
