# With Tears of Joy the Masters Work Continues

April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

John the Beloved received by Al Fike

I am John. I come too, in tears of joy, to know that the work of the Master continues upon the world and that he has designated each one of you to proclaim this truth in the world. I have tears of joy, for the work continues and there are many hungering for this truth.

I urge you to take seriously the proclamations and the [callings of our beloved Master](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2025/en-2025-4-20-2-af-jesus/). I too have witnessed the light he carries and the authority that he has, the brightest and most beautiful of souls in this great world, the universe of God.

God bless you. I am John and I love you.
