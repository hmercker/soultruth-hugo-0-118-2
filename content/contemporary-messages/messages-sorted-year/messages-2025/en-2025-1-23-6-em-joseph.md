# Healing and Health in Relationship to Requests to God

January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Rock Hill, SC, USA

Joseph received by Elizabeth Mack

The Father’s will is that all live in harmony and in love, for all of His children. I am your brother Joseph and I am pleased to speak to you today about healing and health and its relationship to requests to God. The Father’s will is always that His children benefit in every way possible including the well being of their bodies while on the firmament of the Earth plane. Yet, it goes against laws created by God to indiscriminately heal those bodies when their souls have suffered the indignities of disharmony and yet, a loving Father, a giving Father, a forgiving Father allows His mercy to heal children who are truly and deeply sorry for those indignities that have burdened their lives to such an extent that materially they suffer.

Although some may pass over even asking for mercy, even praying to the Father for healings, this is not a bad thing. It is merciful for children with diseased bodies, diseased minds, diseased souls to go to a place where they may heal more quickly and less painfully, so it is with these souls who are transitioning who have suffered physically, who have suffered emotionally, who have suffered in their souls. They go to a place of healing. Not all will pass over but many will and all eventually will pass over. But those who suffer in this physical world will pass over and not suffer the physical pain but rather be given many opportunities to progress, to lighten their souls, to become more joyful, more loving and more dedicated to the paths that they are on, bringing them much happiness. So you see, for those who live upon the Earth at this time, transitioning into the spirit world is painful for those who love them and still love them. But for those who are transitioning, they step into a world where there is much grace and love and opportunities to grow in love. So you see, it is a blessing. In many cases it is a blessing.

But let us remember those who are still in the Earth plane who feel the loss and pray for God to comfort them and pray that they learn the truth of God’s love and how it manifests for those on the Earth plane and in the spirit world.

I have said enough. I welcome this opportunity to speak to you, all of you, about the truth of transitioning, the truth of healing, the truth of God’s love expressed in yet another way for all of humankind.

May God bless you. I am your brother Joseph and I will be residing with this medium and others for a short time. May God bless you. May God bless each and every one of you and my love is with you as well.
