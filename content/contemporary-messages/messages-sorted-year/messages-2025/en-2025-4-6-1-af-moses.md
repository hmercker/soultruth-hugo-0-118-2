Moses received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, beloved souls. I am Moses. I come to inspire, to empower each of you, beloved souls of the Earth. For now, is the time to be strong and to be forthright in the Truth that is God's Love, for this active agent of God's Soul that comes with the Holy Spirit upon each of you needs its expression and demonstration in your lives. The world is in great need, and you have the power to transform the world as an agent of God.

I encourage you, each of you, to reflect upon your ability and capacity to be God's agent of love, a light, a channel of love in the world. As the world continues to degrade into darkness, you and those like you need to hold steadfast in light, to engage in truth and to be channels of love in the world. With this, may you know the joy of God's Love being expressed in every breath of your life. For with this joy comes the resounding bell of truth that declares that the worries and cares of the world at the present time are not so serious and so severe that one cannot feel joy in their lives, that one cannot express joy in their lives.

My beloved brothers and sisters, to be a light is to be joy. To be a light is to be in alignment with God. To be a light is to know the great blessing of God's Love within your soul that echoes forth through you, around you and within you, the resounding voice that says, *“This is truth, and I live and stand for truth in my life. No matter what truth is proclaimed by others, no matter how the world sees truth and reality, I am that truth and I live in the reality of God.”*

This is what all humanity must come to know and come to adhere to, for truth shall reclaim the world and bring it to harmony. Love is the foundation of truth and light comes from these things. As you are God's instruments, you are God's children. You are the ways and means by which truth may be demonstrated and expressed in the world. Each of you who carry the truth within your bosom must express this truth in every way that you are able. For when you have this truth, you have the responsibility of expressing it and living it. God has given you a great gift and God is helping you to open the awareness within of your abilities and gifts of the soul.

Look deep within you. Do not let the prattle of humanity distract you from your true self and true purpose in this world. Be steadfast in truth. Be steadfast in light and you will know yourselves as God's agents of light. For change must come. Healing of the world must come. The ending of pain, suffering and darkness must come. Will you be a part of this? Will you usher in the new world of light, peace and truth? God relies upon His children upon the Earth. God relies upon you. For without His agents of light, how will light manifest in this world? Without your sincere commitment to being a light, how will God manifest truth in the world? Without your desire for His Love and a desire to express that Love through you, how will the Truth of His Love be in the world?

You must demonstrate these things, beloved souls, in everything that you do and everything that you are. In this way, you fulfil your destiny and purpose. God is joyful when His redeeming Love is known and the opportunity to choose it is given in a conscious way in your world, with all your brothers and sisters realising that there is a choice and there is a way beyond the impediments of a soul shackled by error, darkness and pain. There is a way through. There is a way to freedom. Be that voice in the wilderness, beloved souls. Be that example of truth and be that light that shines upon each and every soul you meet.

May the blessings of God's Love continue to awaken you to all that you are and all that you can be. May its redeeming touch lighten you and bring joy to your heart. May the power of its transformation show you the way to your instrumentality, your service to God and to humanity. All is given to you, beloved souls, all in abundance, all in Love, compassion, forgiveness, given freely, given to a soul that longs for its at-onement with God. Know the peace that passes all understanding and find the joy in your heart, my beloveds. God bless you. I am Moses and I come to uphold you, to acknowledge you and to inspire you toward greater heights of soul expression and transformation in Love. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
