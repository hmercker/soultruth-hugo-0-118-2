# Losing the Mind and being in the Heart

September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am Care. I come in the love of God to speak through my mate. From time immemorial, the poets and troubadours, writers, and actors, have attempted to describe human love and, on a higher note, God’s love. Certainly, if you have felt the touch of human love, falling in love, your heart is bursting, your mind is gone. You cannot quite figure it out, you know that they are magnetized, one heart to another, and one could say it’s a form of delirium. Losing the mind and being in the heart.  And so it is with the love of God, which I prayed for intensely while on earth and still do. As has been said, it cannot be found through the mind. The intentions of the soul to connect with its Creator bring this response from the spirit of God into your soul. Bring the essence into the image, transforming it into the very substance, which is love, Divine Love.

When I met my mate, I had been praying for many years. I had witnessed many miracles, but I had truly wished to experience real human love before my departure into spirit, and so we met in a moment where he sensed the light in my soul, and I sensed the real in his. Both of our longings to be at one with God, regardless of where we were on our journey, and so together, we prayed and had many miracles, and the oneness of our bond continues, but even more important, the oneness of our souls with God.

So, beyond the words, beyond the mind, allow your souls to be in ascendancy, for your longings will be answered with the great inflowing of the love of God. May it be yours. I thank you. I am your sister and friend, and I will guide you if necessary, along with the many here. With all my love and blessings, I am Care. God bless you.
