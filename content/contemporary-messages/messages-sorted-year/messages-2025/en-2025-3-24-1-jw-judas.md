Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, Judas. I come in the love of God to your beautiful circle, once again.

There is a saying, a contemporary saying, which encourages speaking truth to power. I wish to remind you that this is something the Master did. Jesus often spoke the truth to the powerful, sometimes just to clarify what his mission was, other times to admonish the hypocrites, but always with love. You know, Simon and I do not speak of Simon Peter, known as “the Rock,” but Simon “The Zealot,” which we called him to distinguish him from Simon Peter and the brother of Jesus. Simon was a zealot because he was part of the Jewish movement to overthrow the Romans, and there were others who followed Jesus who had these aspirations to be free. And so, how did Jesus respond? Give unto Caesar what is his (taxes) and to God what is God’s (your soul).

Live in the world and be not of it, for your destiny lies beyond the shores of your planet, and yet, we would not discourage you from speaking the truth ever, but perhaps more importantly beyond political and social justice, to speak the truth of Divine Love. To gently and lovingly speak truth to the churches, to speak truth beyond mere belief. Invite those, whatever they believe to pray, as you do, to receive this great gift. For, the heavenly Father wishes this above all things, so seek this first, then carry this love into your daily lives.

I wasn’t going to speak about dreams, but I shall say a few words. Dreams are often one’s wishes, one’s fears, often working out problems and there are some spirits who come into your dreams to do this. But, if your dreams are fearful or negative, then I encourage you to pray, that your dreams will be in the company of angels with the guidance of grace. And when you have a dream that you awaken from and feel as if the moments in your sleep were more real than this moment upon awakening, then you have truly gone into spirit and you have truly visited with those in spirit.

So, we say pray as you awaken, pray whenever you are mindful of God or in need of a moment of grace that it may linger, and pray before you sleep so that your soul is accompanied by light and love. And if you wish us to come, we shall. I will speak more about this at a later date and simply say I love coming to this circle and being with my brother, whom I often visit.

Now let us go back, step back into our souls, our longings, our heart’s desire to be at one with our loving Creator, most Holy God. Let us let go, let us allow and permit this love to come into our souls. May God’s most holy spirit be with us and bring this great love into each one in this moment. Allow. I join you now. God bless you.

I am Judas.
