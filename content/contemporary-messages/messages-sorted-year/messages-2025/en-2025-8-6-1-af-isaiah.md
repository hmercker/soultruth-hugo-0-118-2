# Awakening the Faculties of the Soul

August 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Happy Mediums Development Retreat, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Isaiah received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Isaiah. Your experience with your Creator is your own. It is a blessing and a gift given to you alone, for no one can create the experience of communing with God for you. It is your soul with God’s Soul, your soul open to the great gift of His Divine Love that comes through the Holy Spirit. Yet, the faculties required within the soul to know God are well in place within each one of you. It is for you to ignite those faculties by receiving the great gift of God’s Love, by allowing those aspects of your soul to awaken, by honouring and revering those parts of you that are coming awake. In this way, you will understand the conversation of the soul, not by further speculation but by true and powerful experience.

Each of you is capable of truly knowing God. Many of you have known God in ways that you cannot describe. Yet, God continues to reach out to you, seeking that connection and that blessing. It is for you to reach out to God to cement the bond between you and to make it a real and living part of yourself. When this happens and you repeat the experience many times, the awareness of God, God consciousness, becomes a living thing within you that you do not lose or forget. It becomes truly a part of your consciousness with every moment and with every waking hour. You come to know that your life, your being, is truly a creation of God and that God watches over each one of you.

In the power of that creation, the beauty and glory of it, you walk in a light, a grace that is like none other. You are claimed by God and you have claimed God. These are the experiences of the soul. This is what your soul yearns for. Your soul will continue to yearn, not for the moment, not for a period of time, but for all eternity. That yearning continues and it grows. That desire for God in its purity and innocence is a part of you. It is within you and it needs to be acknowledged. Your response in prayer and desire, your effort to be with God, is what will bring you into alignment. As you seek this great gift from God, the gift of His Essence, so you come to know your true nature. Indeed, the faculties of the soul begin to come alive. They are expressed in gifts, insights, experiences, perceptions, capacity to love, capacity for compassion, gifts of healing, gifts to bring comfort and peace to another, gifts to be a channel of love and light wherever you go.

This is what your souls seek, my friends. This is the journey you must take, for the soul will not be satisfied until it is fully in relationship with its Creator. You each seek this. At times, that connection is recognised, felt and experienced. At other times, it is not. Such is the way of your world, such is the way of the soul, often repressed and ignored by your conscious self engaged in mindful things. Yet, you continue in this struggle, in this desire and this effort. You will find yourself upon a path toward at-onement with God. You are already on that path, but you will find yourself to be consciously walking on this path. It will guide you, encourage you, bring fulfilment and joy to you as what you seek is realised, what God has to give to you is consciously accepted and experienced.

The consciousness of God is a great and powerful blessing. It comes with the opening of the faculties of your soul, which are blessed by the great gift. You are on that road, my friends. Each of you, in your own way, seeks out God. In doing so, there will be communication and there will be communication with your angel friends. We are waiting  for you. We are waiting for that connection with you, but we do not want to supersede your connection with God. Thus, you must establish this first and foremost before we take that step, which will be easily taken when you are well-established in your soul consciousness with the divine consciousness.

Seek this out. Put this first and foremost upon your journey. All else will follow. Many gifts, faculties and abilities will be expressed because of this alignment between you and your Heavenly Father. It is a simple task and yet many of you feel far from this. It is a most valuable task, most important and most needed. Be true to your soul’s longings, beloved children of God. God will respond always to a true and deep yearning to be with Him. We shall go there together, my friends, to the great communing of God’s Soul and your soul, that beautiful relationship that ensures your continued progress and development of the soul.

God bless you. I am Isaiah. My love is with you, my friends. I am with you on that journey and many more. We continue. We continue. God bless you in His Love.
