# Precious Flowers of God

November 15<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Happy Days Farm Retreat, Dallas, UR, USA

Confucius received by Al Fike

Precious souls, I am Confucius. I come to bring healing and peace, light and love to this dear circle of earnest souls. Allow yourselves to open to the blessings offered. Like petals of the flower exposing the beauty within, so you are these precious flowers of God awakening to all the Love that is for you, the healing that is flowing toward you, the beauty of God's Touch upon you, each and every one a precious child of God, each and every one seeking to be awakened and truly within the flow of truth, light and love.

Take heed of the call of your soul. Listen and follow those inclinations and inspirations of the soul. For as you do so, you will be guided ever closer to God, awakened ever more fully to that part of you that knows God and in alignment with God. So much is given to the soul that opens and desires, prayers and faith budding within. The peace that passes all understanding is yours, my friends, yours for the asking. The nurturance of God's Touch is yours for the asking.

My beloved friends, my little birds, spread your wings and fly to the reaches of God's great Soul, fluttering and singing your song, giving God joy with your unique song and the plumage that is yours, the beauty that is your soul truly, truly being expressed. God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Confucius. I love you so, indeed, indeed. God bless you. God bless you.
