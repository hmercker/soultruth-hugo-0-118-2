George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am George, once your brother upon the Earth and now your brother in the Celestial Heavens. I come with great love and blessings for each of you upon the wires. We seek the Father's Love. We truly endeavour to open our souls. As we do so, there is an inflowing, a great inflowing of the Father's Love and blessings for each soul upon this screen.

But my dear children, what will you do with these blessings given by the Creator of all? [^1] Will you seek to use them in your daily life? Will you seek to bless others with your presence and these blessings? Will you seek to follow the Master along the path that brings you closer to the Father? For all of these things, you have been blessed. My only point here is do not think in terms of applying only one aspect of each of these blessings, which will become very obvious to you within the next couple of days as you go about your business upon the Earth.

Know that you can apply these blessings in every moment of your life. How I wish you could see how deep, how pervasive and how uplifting are these blessings for you. As you take each step in your day, give thanks to God for all that He has blessed you with. Allow your souls to be open in those moments that you give thanks and yet more blessings will be bestowed upon you. Come to know how immense, how pervasive and how extraordinary are these gifts that the Father gives to you. Pray to know them. Pray to utilize them. Pray to share them and pray to give thanks for them.

I will stay and pray with you. Many of my brothers and sisters from the Celestial Heavens, from across the universe and dear ones in the spirit world, we are all here together as one in this Love. Let us focus this love upon our Father.

[^1]: In reviewing this message, George explained that some of these blessings were the activation of soul qualities and some were newly given qualities to our souls. He also explained that these blessings were intended to be utilized and therefore benefiting, in effect, our brothers and sisters.
