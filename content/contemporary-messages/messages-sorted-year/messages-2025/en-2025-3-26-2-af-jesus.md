# Blesses Each One of Us

March 26<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May the Father's Love continue to flow into your souls, beautiful children of God. I come. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you and to be with you. I come to teach the Truth of Divine Love, as I did in the beginning and continue to do so. I come to pray for each one of you, my brothers and sisters, all of you.

We are part of God's family of love. We are children of the truth. We have found the way to at-onement with God. Some of us are further along this path than others, but indeed, we walk together upon a path that shall bring us to at-onement. Along that path, we are here to love, help and support one another, as any family would. We are bonded in love and we are dedicated to one another in love.

In this regard, I am no different from you. I am your brother. We are each other's friends and helpers. We are here to use our gifts, our wisdom and our love to uphold one another. We are here, united in one goal, to receive the great gift that God has to give. In our choice to be with God, we are in harmony and light. The great peace that passes all understanding is upon us. The Hand of God reaches forth for us to grab, to take hold and to be lifted up.

These gifts and blessings are a reflection of the bountiful Soul of God. For God created each one of us to find our way home to our Creator, to be in at-onement, to be in harmony and grace with our beloved Creator. These things are made possible by the sincerity and desires of your soul. You are given all of this freely, only asking that you ascribe to the truth, walk in the ways of truth and pray for the gift that is given in this truth.

> We, the children of God, seek You, dear God, seek Your blessings, seek the transformation and upliftment that comes when Your Holy Spirit touches our souls and brings the Essence forth, infilling us and enlightening us in this great gift of Love.

We are together, my beloveds, never to part, but to walk together for eternity in the grace of God and all that that brings. We are given the gift, the way and the light that will bring life everlasting and blessings beyond understanding, blessings that shall wipe away any fears or doubts, any pains or anguish, any loneliness or forsakenness. We will find our way to the pleasures and wonderments of the Celestial Kingdom. Together, we walk that road and are truly Your children, dear Father.

God bless you, my beloved, beautiful friends. My love for you is great. God's Love for you is far greater. Be in this grace as we open ourselves to the Holy Communion that replenishes our souls. God bless you, my beloveds. We sit in prayer together. God bless you. I am your brother, Jesus, and I love you. God bless you, forever.
