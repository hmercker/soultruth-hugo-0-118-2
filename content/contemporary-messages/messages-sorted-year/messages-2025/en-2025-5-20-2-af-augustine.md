Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I wonder whether you have firmly in your mind the process of receiving the Father's Love. It does not come because you have an assumption it is given to you. It comes with earnest prayer, asking for the inflowing of this gift of Love. It does not come on the heels of a prayer that insinuates that that Love is given without desire or without specific asking for its gift. It comes with prayer, specific, longing and full of desire. I know for some of you who have been praying for a long time, it is hard to muster up deep longing within you. This prayer becomes a daily routine. Indeed, the desire is somewhat lukewarm in its presentation to God. Yet, the amount of Divine Love you receive is dependent upon the intensity of the desire and the intention of the one who prays.

My beloved and beautiful students, if you wish a great inflowing of the Father's Love, I encourage you to pray intensely and to have within your mind the question for God, “Will you grant me this gift? I ask for this gift to be granted.” When this question arises from not only your mind but your soul, then you enact laws that pertain to the inflowing of God's Love. Indeed, as these laws are enacted, as your longing is displayed to God, along with this longing often comes a vulnerability, a humility, a feeling of wanting to be with your Heavenly Father, a childlike vulnerability and desire that originates within the soul.

It is a place of vulnerability for many. You have been taught to be independent and strong and to not rely on anyone but yourself. Yet, this deep misconception of what life is inhibits the blessing of God into your soul. You must refresh your true longings and feelings from within every time you pray, opening yourself fully to the inflowing of God's Love, asking that God may send His Holy Spirit to make possible that inflowing, as God pours within you this gift, these Living Waters. God cannot add this gift to a soul that is closed. God cannot open the soul forcibly. God waits for you to open, for you to ask and for you to receive when you are in that state of reception, allowing your need to be expressed to God, allowing that vulnerability to rise up to the surface of your consciousness and beyond to your Heavenly Father.

This is how every soul must come to God, not from a place of apathy or a place of arrogance, but a place of true longing, vulnerability and honesty. In that place, God will touch you deeply. When your longing is true and strong, there may be tears. There may be tears of joy. Yet, when the emotions are in alignment with that longing, then the passageway is clear and the possibility of that Love flowing into your soul is great.

Do not allow your mind and your mindful conceits to get in the way of the truth that lives within your soul, that true feeling, that true longing and that true desire. This is what God listens to. This is your true self being expressed toward God in prayer. When you can do that, whether it be in words or not, then God truly hears you. You ignite the laws that pertain to the inflowing of this Love, this Essence of God's Soul. When you love God, you acknowledge God's Love for you and that yearning is deep, that longing is almost painful, then the connection is made and the true gift is given. Be true to your souls, beloveds. Be true to what your soul's expression is. In prayer, it must come with honesty and sincerity. In prayer, it must be real, palpable and powerful within you. Express this to God and God will indeed respond in Love, abundantly and with a great inflowing into your soul will come this response.

My beloved and beautiful students of truth, this basic lesson is meant to refresh your memory, your understanding of what true prayer is and what this gift requires in order to be given. Follow the laws. Seek deep within you the sincerity, the longing that is all too real and powerful. Allow it to emerge and shoot forward to the great Soul of God and you will be rewarded with the gift you so long for.

God bless you, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I pray with you. I open myself to the inflowing of this gift from God. I pray that you, too, will join me in sincere prayer. God bless you, beloved souls. Augustine loves you all. God bless you.
