George Stokes received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my friends. I am George, George Stokes. I am happy that this instrument has allowed me to come and speak today, for he has some reticence with this relationship, this rapport that has been created, but indeed, he has allowed me to come and I am happy to be here.

My beloved friends, all the efforts that you make in the material world create a certain perspective, an understanding of the truth as a reflection of your prayer life and your spiritual life in service in the world. Indeed, as you continue to pray and to work toward light, that perspective changes and grows. The awakening of your soul ensures that this happens.

Yet, I must tell you, when your time comes to transition into the spirit world, that perspective will change dramatically. You will see the truth as it is, rather than interpret it through the material world and the material perspective. The spirituality will be easily understood and accessed in your efforts to be with God and your desire to be with your soul. All the efforts that you have made on Earth will benefit you greatly when you transition into spirit.

I had my perspectives and my ideas when I walked on the Earth plane. I was a leader and an influencer of many. Some of these things that I shared, I regret. Some I am happy about. Some I had compensation to deal with and much I had the benefit of my efforts and my instrumentality. Yet, primarily, I truly came to understand my soul. Of course, we want this for every one of you while on Earth, to truly know your own soul, to know the workings of your soul and the workings of your relationship of your soul to God's great Soul.

We come to help you with this. We come to ensure that there is understanding. That understanding may not be fully realised while on Earth, but it makes for a good beginning, a good foundation that will help you come to that place of truth, of true soul awakening and being. Whether it comes fully upon the Earth plane, or whether it comes when you are in the spirit world, it must come. It is inevitable that it will come. For all the efforts you have made, all the times you have been in prayer, all the speaking and doing of comforting, healing and helping you have done while on Earth will count for much when you are in the spirit world.

This instrument mentioned earlier in the day that he believes that the work you do in the material world is far more appreciated in the spirit world and that you are better known in these places. This is a truth that, indeed, many crowd around you, curious and wanting to know the truth, for they see your light, they sense your love, they hear your words, they see your actions and they are hungering for truth. Many in the spirit world, the lower planes, are hungering for truth. They come and we help to bring them to come and gather around you, to be in that place where you are all together and you are all assisting in the work and bringing light with your prayers, opening the door with your desires of soul, speaking the truth in the way that you know truth and using your gifts so that others may benefit.

My friends, there is much work to do. This work reaches many on different levels, different planes of existence, even those from different planets, even those who are in darkness in the spirit world and those who are in the semi-light of the spirit world. Oh yes, there are many, many who can benefit from your efforts, from the way in which you comport yourself on Earth, from the words that you share, the loving channels that you can be, provided you wish to be this.

My advice to you is pray and pray often. Put the intention forward to God that you want to be servants of truth, that you want to be lights, that you want to be that channel of love and blessings for others. Whether they are in the flesh or in the spirit, it matters not, my friends. For all who seek gather and all who seek, and those connected to them, and connected to them, are benefiting from the efforts that you are making in prayer, from the light that you are drawing to you, from the light that gathers as a result of all of your efforts combined, making something greater than the whole, making something magnificent.

My friends, you are truly blessed and shall truly be blessed with all the magnificence and the wonders that are God's Touch upon your soul and that are the beauty of your life. I am George. I come to speak to you and encourage you, my friends, encourage you greatly, encourage you on the path of truth. God bless you and keep you in His Love.
