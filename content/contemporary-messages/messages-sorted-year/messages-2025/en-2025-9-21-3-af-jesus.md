# Engage the Desires and Inspiration of the Soul

September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Jesus received by Al Fike

The Love of God is the key to all things, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. My hope is that you may feel and know my presence, that you may feel and know my presence not just this day, but when you pray, when you seek out God, that I am your best and most beloved friend in these prayers. For without your desire to awaken and transform your soul in the Father's Love, you merely practise a mental exercise. Something that will bring you certain blessings and gifts, but will not bless you with the depth and breadth that comes with the Father's Love.

These other gifts and blessings will have their effect, but they will not transform you. The blessing of healing is for all. All souls who desire this will receive it. At times, inspiration comes but, what is the source of that inspiration? Is it of the highest? At times, the will of the individual seeks harmony, something that, to them, reflects justice and rightness of being but, are these things not of the mind rather than the soul? When the soul is engaged, it knows that it is a child of God. It knows where to go to be with God. It knows what it desires and longs for. When you listen and are in alignment with your soul, then all that is meant to be from God, given to you, will come in abundance. It will come in a mighty flow, an onrush of blessings.

This cannot happen without the sincere desire of the soul to receive and to be open to God. This is what we teach. This is what I taught when I was on Earth. This is what you must teach to others. Without that very rudimentary understanding, then the individual misses the mark and begins to assert their will of the mind for the blessings and manifestations that the mind will bring to it. When you put your mind aside and seek out the blessings of the soul, then you are truly on the Path Divine and you will truly know the blessings of God. Be that child, that innocent soul, seeking its Redeemer, its Creator, its Father in heaven. All of these things come in the awareness of the soul, awakening to the Touch of God. We are here together in this sacred place with our yearnings, set forth our prayers, bringing its response.

Be at peace, my beloveds. Know that I am with you always, that I am your best and most beloved brother who loves you so and will do all that I can to uplift you and protect you and to pray with you in the glories of the light, the blessings and onrush of the Holy Spirit upon you. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you.
