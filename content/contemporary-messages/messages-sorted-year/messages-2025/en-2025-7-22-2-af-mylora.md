Mylora received by Al Fike

Thank you for your prayer, dear sister. I am Mylora. I come to bring light, healing and good cheer to all of you, beautiful souls of Earth. I am truly a Celestial Angel. I have been so for longer than I can remember. It has been a long time, but I have been in spirit for much longer than that. My journey in the spirit realms has been a long one, but full of blessings, full of discoveries and full of life.

I walked for a few moments with this instrument in his garden. Oh, the glories there. The beautiful flowers that he has fostered in his garden are truly wonderful. When I walked the earth, there were no gardens such as this. There was only God's Garden and that too had its glories. Indeed, the flowers were simple, delicate and lovely. Yet now, I see the hand of man has been creative, helped to bring forth these beautiful gifts, these visual blessings for all to see.

Indeed, the creative hand of man is a wonderful thing when it sets its course upon that which is in harmony with creation and that which is a true expression of the soul. I urge each of you, my beloved friends, to put your thoughts and your hand upon all that which is of God, that you may be co-creators in this world, that you may be a light in this world, channels of love for others. Love can be expressed in many ways and through many avenues. Creativity is a beautiful way to express love. Embracing your brothers and sisters. Helping them along the road. Assisting them in need. There are many avenues of service for a willing soul who wishes to help to bring light into the world. Giving a nod of appreciation, even a simple hello to a passerby, can be a blessing for them and for you.

In so many ways, you may be a channel of light. You may acknowledge your light by shining it upon another. When you do so, you may be assured that an angel is by your side, strengthening and deepening that light and blessing for another. When you perform an act of service, your angel friends are close and wish to utilise that opportunity to bring a blessing to all that you meet, to all those who are in your life and to the world as a whole. We want to utilise every opportunity available to us to be a channel for God, to be a blessing for another and to be light in the world. So many opportunities, my friends. How beautiful is life when you are truly with God and truly a conduit for God's blessings for another and for yourself. So much is given in many ways, on many levels, through many conduits and opportunities.

I ask you to be a light, my friends. Whatever way that is for you, may that way be opened. May your gifts flow and flourish in the Love of God. May you be that instrument that God intends, for when you are, this is the path to joy. This is the path to love. In time, you will know deep at-onement with your Creator. That joy will be so great that you will feel as if you have gone to heaven. Indeed, in time, you will join us there in the glories and wonderments of the Celestial Heaven.

My beloved friends, may you be blessed and may you know the peace of God's Touch. May your heart and soul open to a great inflowing of the Father's Love. I am Mylora. Know that I love you. I am with you often. It is a blessing for me to have that opportunity to be close. God bless you, my friends, and keep you in the light. Mylora loves you. God bless you.
