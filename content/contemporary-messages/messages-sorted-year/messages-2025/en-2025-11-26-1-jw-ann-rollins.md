Dear sisters and brothers, it is I, your friend in the love of God. I am Ann Rollins.

You live in a world of instant gratification and what seems to be an endless pursuit of material things, of self-gratification, of recognition, of security, and of safety. All of the time and resources spent on these things of the earth occupy the majority of souls on the planet. Of course, you wish for yourselves and others the bare necessities, the basic things that are needed, and the irony is that those who do not have all these necessities are the ones most likely to reach out to God, for that which is not of the material world, but for the sake of their souls.

The mercy of God is great, and the vastness of His creation is awesome. But still, in the longings of every soul to be at one with our loving Creator, distance is dispelled, as is doubt and fear.

You know, my dear James [^1], he had his moments of indulgence, and yet the longing he had to communicate with his dear Helen brought him into a prayerful place, a rapport with the Master, and so many others. And he was told that he needed to think spiritual thoughts, pray, and leave what was not helpful behind. And of course, we all encouraged him and his magnificent gift, which the Master called His second coming, giving the world the true gospel of Divine Love; the true meaning of resurrection, and the New Birth. I tell you these things because you tend to worry about those things you have done to be fulfilled that have failed, perhaps choices you have made that you now regret. This, of course, is the human condition, and you have been given the key to the world beyond and the many mansions the Master spoke of and His kingdom in the celestial heavens.

So, as you pray and you hear the whispers of God guiding you, and you feel forgiven, and you begin to feel worthy, and you begin to forgive yourself and move on. Those that you have left behind will at some point on their journeys wish to reconnect with you, being drawn to your light, to your love. This is true on earth but even more so in the spirit world, where every step forward brings a degree of lightness, the light that emanates from the love of God in a soul being transformed. The light of a divine angel.

Allow your prayers to be free. Allow your prayers to express your deepest longings, your highest wishes, so that what might begin in grief or in crisis becomes transformed into joy, awaiting the great love, as you would a loved one arriving, your soul calling out for the arrival of God’s love in oneness. It is important to allow yourself to let go. It is important to allow your heart to heal, your soul to be blessed.

I could, if I so desired to do so, delve into the complexities of life, to, as you might say, psychoanalyze all the things that prevent one from engaging, but it is not necessary with this group.

So, I encourage you to pray, as you do, and be the blessing that your soul is to the world. In this season of giving, we remind you once again, give the gift of love, above all things. For it is priceless and everlasting. With all my love and the blessings of God above and all here, I step back, and I thank you.

I am Ann Rollins, your sister in Christ. God bless you.
