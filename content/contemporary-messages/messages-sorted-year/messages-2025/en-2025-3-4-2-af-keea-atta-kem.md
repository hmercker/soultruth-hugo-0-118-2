God bless you, my friends. I am Keea atta Kem. The path to God is so simple. Indeed, each of you, even though you struggle, have found that when your feelings, intentions and prayers are simple, then they reach their mark and have their response from the Divine Touch upon you. In fact, most things that are in harmony with God's laws are simple. Unfortunately, humanity wishes to delve into the intricacies of material interactions in God's universe. This fascinates so many because this feeds the mind and the mind's need for order, categorisation and putting facts together in a linear stream of logic.

Indeed, God gave you the ability to do this. Yet, God's intention was not that humanity should focus entirely upon this gift, these faculties of the material mind. When I say that the truth is simple, I mean that the way of accessing the truth and understanding it often comes in a simple experience, creating what you call downloads of knowledge and understanding. Though these experiences include many bits of information and many avenues of perception, the way in which it is accessed is not through overthinking a situation, a scenario and a truth. It is in the simple act of prayer.

When a prayer is truly sincere, then you come to that place of true connection with your Creator. You come to a place of soul to Soul. That place is not restricted by the earthly conditions, by your own negativity and your own ignorance. Rather, it is a special dispensation from God that allows you that clear and powerful connection. It allows you to understand from your soulâ€™s perception the power and the beauty and the wonderment of God's Love for you, of God's creation of you and of God's creation of the universe.

As you continue to understand these things and continue to experience these things, then you are being prepared to teach these things in a way that will help others understand in the way that you have understood, in a way that you have accessed this truth, leaving behind the mechanisms of mind, the many words that ensue and the many concepts that rise up within you. Rather, the simple and direct way to God brings the most powerful results.

The clarity is obvious. The power of what is given is tremendous. The understanding then leaves little room for speculation. Rather, it is an invitation to integrate, to pull into you the truth in the way that God gives it to you, that truth that resides within the soul and infills the soul as it infills with the Father's Love. Yes, the ways are simple. Yet, as you and so many in the world continue to complicate and adorn the simple truth, it becomes a struggle. It becomes distorted.

My beautiful friends, make efforts to put aside that inclination, that habit, that pattern that brings so many complications into your thoughts and into your understanding of spiritual truth. If you can do so, then the way toward God and at-onement with God becomes much simpler and much easier and the expectations of the mind are not the true expectations. For these true expectations are from the soul, the desires of the soul. What does the soul desire the most but at-onement with God, to be loved, to be nurtured by the Creator, to know God, to be with God and to be in the harmony and peace that is of God.

I encourage you upon this path of simple but true at-onement with God. Put aside all your worries and cares, your trials and tribulations, for they only exist because you give too much power to the mind. If you can quell the mind and the mind is able to find its true existence within your consciousness, then you will be well on your way to being a true and beautiful instrument for God, a channel of love, manifesting many blessings and many things for others to comprehend and witness. You may be a powerful teacher of truth and, most of all, an example of truth.

My beautiful friends, be that light in the way that light is created, in the way that light is expressed. Be a channel of love in the way that love is given, and love can be expressed. Be a teacher in the way that the soul understands, and the soul can express. In this way, you will be those beautiful instruments that God wishes of you.

May you be blessed. I am Keea atta Kem. I come to encourage you on the path and be with you in God's Love. God bless you, my friends. My love is with you always. God bless you.
