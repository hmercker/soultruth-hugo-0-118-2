Luke received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, your brother, Luke.

May the love of God be upon us and fill our souls.

I have spoken before about healing, about the need for medicine and medication to help one heal. I then segued that into spiritual healing, reminding the group that the medication for spiritual healing is prayer, and you cannot overdose on the medicine of prayer for God’s love.

For some, to go from the world and the material mind into a state of communion is an easy task. For others, it is like climbing a mountain. But as one walks on the journey and takes time to be in their soul, whatever struggle you have been going through is eased, for the burdens of life are lifted in the elation and elevation, and jubilation of God’s love. Prayer can seem a difficult undertaking when one feels unworthy or unqualified to speak to God. So many barriers that the mind erects, so many walls that the heart constructs, and yet all these are dissipated in an instant when one allows the heart to open and the soul to send out its longing. You need not assume some special position, and whether you are in God’s creation in nature or in the confines of a room, there is no distance to travel, to send your prayer to God. Heavens will open. We celestials will come and assist you. For in the grace of God, all things are possible.

In the moment that His holy spirit brings the love into your souls, there is a healing, for God’s love is the balm that soothes the soul, that brings peace to the mind, that calms the body. Whatever your physical condition, your soul receives a healing with every drop of God’s love. And as you allow your body to relax and have faith, we minister to you and whatever healing is possible within the laws of God’s kingdom and His universe, it is given. Trust this and you will see the miracle. For each one here has given their soul over to God, whether you are new on this journey or a long-time traveler. This is the only thing the heavenly Father asks of His children: **to open to His love, above all things, to seek the kingdom.** This is deliverance, this is redemption, and this is transformation.

May the light and the love of God be with us all in this moment and in our walk, whether we be on earth or in spirit. For there is no distance in the love of God.

I thank you. I am your brother in Christ, a redeemed soul, a disciple of the Master.

I am Luke, the Physician. God bless you.
