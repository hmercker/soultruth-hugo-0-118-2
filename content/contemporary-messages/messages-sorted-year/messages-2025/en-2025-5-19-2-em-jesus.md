Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I am your brother, Jesus. I am who I say I am. I follow my Father's Will in all that I do and I am Master of the Celestial Heavens far above this Earth plane. I come to you with blessings, many blessings, for your prayers today are deep, sincere, soulful and faithful. We are building upon these prayers a condition of Love in which you all may reside for the moment, so you may receive these gifts given to you by the Father to continue your work upon this Earth for the sake of humanity.

Yes, there are many, many souls, many beings here who are from many different places. They come because you call, because you desire to communicate with souls who have a great deal of Divine Love in them. They come to assist your growth in this Divine Love, to assist in your growth and development, that you all may progress as this world becomes more harmonious, more loving, more than any other time in its history. They come because God wills it so.

We are all here to support you, help you, love you and truly, truly uplift and guide you. It is a momentous journey that you all seek and that you take at this time. We follow the Father's Will to accomplish the outcome that is His desire for each of you and for this Earth. Feel the Love, children. This is what you are working toward: more and more of this Love in your souls and in your daily lives, even while you live upon the Earth. Remember this experience. Keep it close to you as you travel this road to at-onement with God.

I will uphold you throughout your prayer. I am your brother and Master of the Celestial Heavens. I am Jesus. My love for you is so great. Allow the Father's blessings to come to you.
