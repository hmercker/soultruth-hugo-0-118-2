# Divine Love Binds One to Another and to God

August 31<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Beams of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Mary and I come with my beloved son, who is the Master of the Celestial Heavens. He speaks truly of this Love that is the Essence of our Creator. He speaks truly of the wealth and glory that comes with this Love from our Father into our souls and transforms us, as it did my son and me and many others who will surround you and protect you along your journey to our Father.

This Love binds one to another and all to God. It is the highest of Laws. It is the most joy that one can express. This Love is above all others, including a mother's love for her children. I say this to you, as you know my son, who I loved deeply as a mother and who led us to our Father, this Love from God is greater still. We walk with you. We will continue to walk with you and we will welcome you when you enter the Celestial Kingdom. This Love has bound us, sister to sister, brother to brother, mother to child and all to God.

I am Mary and I love you with this Love from God that is unshakable. May you be open to God's blessings as God pours them into your souls.
