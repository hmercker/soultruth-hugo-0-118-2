# We Continue to Pray Together for God's Love

May 4<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Mary received by Al Fike

I come to you in love. I am Mary. I come to you in prayer, for even though my journey has been much longer than yours, we continue to pray for the same things, the nourishment of our souls in the Father's Love. That nourishment is familiar and so much a part of me now, as I have grown and discovered the wonders of God's Love.

Yet, as I continue on that journey of discovery, I also have a deep desire to share in this discovery and Truth with you all and with whoever might be receptive to this blessing from God. I come a long way from where I live to be with you, beloveds, to pray with you, because you are a part of my heart. You are a part of God's great family of children who seek out His favour and blessings through the Holy Spirit that touches your soul.

May you continue to find your way upon this journey, so many things to discover, so many aspects of yourself to know, so many aspects of God to feel, to perceive and to be a part of this great flow that is His gift of Love to all of us. We are brethren. We are together in this great and eternal journey toward at-onement with God. I love you all. I am with you all. I shall continue to be with you in the grace of God, the Love of God, the beauty and wonderment that is God's Touch for all of us.

May your souls open wide and feel this blessing flow in such abundance that all impediments, all pain, all injuries, all error and all darkness be dissipated and you are purely in the light. My love is with you. I am Mary and I love you. God bless you.
