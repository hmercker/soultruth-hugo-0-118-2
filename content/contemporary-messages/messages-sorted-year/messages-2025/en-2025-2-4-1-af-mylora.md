# Closing Message Blessing of Healing

February 4<sup>th</sup>, 2025

San Salvador Estate, Trinidad

Mylora received by Al Fike

The blessings of the Father's Love are upon you, beloveds. I am Mylora. You have done good work. You have travelled to these islands of souls seeking, islands where many are lost. Indeed, God has a foothold on these places. We are working with many who are seeking the truth. Those efforts and desires are often repressed by the mind, the scepticism and mistrust that lie within it, a reflection of the earthly conditions of these places. But indeed, the souls are ignited and seeking. That urge and that desire will continue to grow within them. You will draw those to you, beloved souls. Your groups will grow, your gatherings will expand, and the efforts will continue to be made by your angel friends and by God's Touch upon them.

It requires your persistence and faith. It requires your strength. It requires your capacity in prayer and in growing, maturing in love, maturing in perception and maturing in your capacity to love. The challenges continue to be presented in your lives, beloved souls, but you can see for yourself how God brings what you require to meet those challenges and what is necessary to overcome the barriers. When the dark forces of this world conspire against you, your refuge is in God and your strength is in prayer. Your insight and wisdom come from the soul, where the material obstructions will be overcome by these blessings, perceptions and strengths within you, by God's Hand protecting you and the angels surrounding you.

Do not step back but step forward, beloved souls, no matter your present condition and circumstance. Every time you step forward, you are blessed, and you are strengthened. You have more light around you and within you. You have found a way to overcome the dilemmas of life. You have found the way to satisfy the yearnings of your soul. You have found the way to garner wisdom and truth. As you progress upon this path, you will find that any doubts, any discouragements within your thinking will dissolve in the Light of God's Love, in His mercy, grace and blessings upon you all.

For indeed, God knows your challenges. God knows what is happening with each one and what is happening in the world. God continues to plan and orchestrate solutions and blessings to overcome the chaos, negativity and darkness that exist in your world. When you reach above, when you seek for the highest, when you go to God in earnestness and faith, then you will find your way through the maze of the dark world toward light and greater light. So much is dependent upon your choice and your free will. So much requires your prayers and your faith.

You are children of God. Everyone is a child of God, a creation with a purpose, a destiny and a journey. It is for you to find the high road above the fray and the chaos, to be in the harmony, blessings and peace of God's Touch. That way, you are at peace. You have a measure of joy. You have a strength and perception regarding your passage of life that is of light and harmony, rather than being downtrodden in worry and despair. You may teach this. As you grow stronger in this, you may teach it to others. You may share this truth, this experience in life, this way of living, with your brothers and sisters.

First, you must be strong. First, you must care for your own soul and seek the nourishment of that soul with the blessing of God's Love. When that is firmly established, then you will find that you are compelled to go out in the world and be that channel, to be a light and true to God's Will, His blessings directed toward you.

There is so much given, beloved souls, and so much more that God wishes to give. Be open wide, wide, as these blessings funnel in toward you, its focus and concentration upon you. Be open and receive the blessings in gratitude and love for God, understanding that you have found the truth, and the truth is conspiring to set you free from the constraints and conditions of the human world.

God bless you, beloved souls. I bring healing and peace for you all. I am Mylora, one of many who are with you this day. May you be blessed in the Father's Love, blessed mightily, uplifted fully. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. Mylora loves you. God bless you.
