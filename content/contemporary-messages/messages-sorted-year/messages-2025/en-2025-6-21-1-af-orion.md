# Transformation of Your Souls is Your Destiny

Orion received by Al Fike

The world continues to change, my friends, and so do you. I am Orion. The universe is destined to evolve and change. It is a Law of Creation. Your world is destined to evolve and change. You are destined to evolve and change. All that is required for you to be greater lights, to evolve into more refined souls, is given to you freely. You walk upon a world, a destiny and an experience of life that will not stay the same. It does not remain static.

You, my beloved friends, must be open and receptive to change. You must come to realise that the deepest change of all is the transformation of your soul as you receive this great gift of God's Love, the Essence of His Soul. When you are attuned to this and come to accept it in all its ramifications and complexities, integrating these things into your consciousness, then you are part of the change that is intended. You become an active agent of change that God wishes for you to be.

Do not let the stodginess of your mind, that mind that desires stability, routine and to be unchallenged by that which it does not understand, hold you back. For you are on a journey of developing the soul and the awareness of soul. In the fluidity of soul awareness, there is a greater capacity to accept change and to adopt and integrate change into one's consciousness. The soul is flexible and malleable, but it is also strong, perceptive, and wise and has the deep desire to be in alignment with all that is in harmony, all that is of light and all that is of God. It is a different way of viewing the world and experiencing the world, but it is a way that is needed and a way that shall be a part of the future of humanity. We are helping you to develop these things now as forerunners, as harbingers, to bring change to the world and to bring a new perspective, a new way of being.

Even though you resist and you often prefer the solidity of mindful things, the power of change, recalibration and opening to new insights and perceptions is happening within each one of you. This dichotomy continues, one that we have spoken of many times. Indeed, often these two parts of you are contradictory and are in conflict with one another. The soul does not know conflict like the mind. The soul continues to press ahead and seek to develop, awaken and be transformed. This is the destiny of the soul, while the mind holds back and has its fears, its doubts, its rationalisations and intellectualisations that continue to insist that the way of the brain and the mind is the way forward.

You have been taught this. You have exercised this mindful part of you fully and continue to wish to develop it into a greater and more powerful avenue of experiencing life, but it is antiquated and irrelevant to what we are attempting to do together. Thus, it is important that you set aside those protestations of the mind, those worries and cares of the mind and seek out the freedom of the soul, soul awareness and soul being. When you can do this and the strength of the soul continues to expand and become more prevalent within your consciousness, then the mind's irrelevancies will dissipate and disappear and a new form and experience of conscious life will emerge within you. You will find yourself seeing, understanding, perceiving, loving, progressing forward and acting in ways that at this moment would seem unfamiliar and quite challenging.

Yet, this is your destiny, my beloved friends. You have chosen this path. As you progress along it, indeed, you come to realise what a strange path it is compared to what is the norm in your world, but this path of strangeness is the path that will save the world. This new way of being, perceiving and experiencing, though not altogether abandoning the physical, will engender deep perceptions and blessed experiences that will help you to realise the true nature of life and the true nature of your life. It requires a modicum of acceptance and bravery, desire and to release that which holds you in the shackles of the human condition.

Each day you are moving a little closer to this realisation and this awareness, a little closer to accepting that you are changing and that that change is for the better. Step by step, breath by breath, thought by thought, action by action, you move into this new world, this new realm of awareness and being. The light grows around you as a result. The consciousness that you hold so dear and believe is reality starts to slip away and you become a part of the great ocean of consciousness, which is that which God has created and that which God offers you as a great benefit, a great transformative thing that will cause you to change in many ways, deeply change, profoundly change. It will bring joy, my friends, deep joy and freedom from this dreadful condition of the Earth. It will bring about the expressions and manifestations that you have prayed for. In God's mercy, these changes come incrementally so that you may adjust, but they come inevitably, powerfully and beautifully.

Do not withhold from these things, but eagerly join in the great flow of transformation that is of your soul. This is what your true self desires. This is what will come of all your efforts, prayers, thoughts and deeds that help sustain this journey and bring you into the new consciousness of soul. How fortunate you are, my friends, to know these things, to experience them and to be open to them. For the world waits for those who are willing to take this journey. In the process of accepting and travelling forward, you must share and inform your brothers and sisters that there is a way out of their dilemmas. There is a way beyond their pain. There is salvation from all that holds society in the thrall of darkness. Be that light, my beloved friends. Speak the truth, live the truth and experience the truth in its fullest way, in all its forms and manifestations. What God has created is wondrous and all species in the universe who have consciousness and soul are destined to acknowledge and to experience this great truth.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. I come again in love to assure you and to guide you. I am honoured with that privilege of doing so. My love is with you. God's Love is here, waiting to inflow into you. Be a part of God's intentions for your upliftment and transformation. We will all find our way together in love, support, peace and harmony. God bless you, my friends.
