# God is Preparing You to be the Spokespeople for this Truth

September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

James received by Al Fike

May God bless you abundantly with His Love. I am Jacob of old. I am mentioned in the Bible.

In the beginning, God intended for His creations, human beings, to have the soul as the predominant consciousness of the individual. That choice to receive the great gift of Divine Love is given freely, but it must be received and accepted by His children and it was not. The acceptance was not there. The desire was not there. Humanity had a very long road to hoe, a very long struggle, seeking self-empowerment through their own desires and conditions. Therefore, humanity had a great fall from grace, as was indicated in the Bible, until our beloved brother Jesus came to reopen the possibility, the invitation to receive that great gift of Love. He did. The gates were open once again. Yet, during the time after his unfortunate and untimely demise, that Truth was lost once more. Though there were those of good soul condition who did receive the Divine Love, there were many who were ignorant of it.

Now, the Truth of God’s Love and blessings for each one is being opened, awakened in humanity. Each of you will play your part in that awakening. Each of you has gifts and abilities to ensure that this truth is not lost. You will contribute and dedicate yourselves to this awakening of humanity. God has brought you together. God is assisting you in your awakening, the awakening of your heart, the awakening of your faculties of the soul, the alignment of all aspects of who you are, so that you will, in time, be a spokesman for God and this Truth. 
We have brought you together for that express purpose, to begin the anointing of your soul, its awakening to truth, to bring the alignment within you toward God. In this process, this blessing, you will find yourself, your true self. In doing so, you will be an example for others. Some of you will speak to many on this very truth. Some of you will support those who speak. Some of you will heal and bring peace and comfort to others. Yet, rest assured, each one of you has a role to play, a purpose and a destiny, in all that God has planned for the salvation of humanity.

Listen carefully, beautiful souls of God. Listen with your souls. Listen with your minds. What you do together in these days is setting the foundation for the future, for what is to come, what is to manifest, what is to facilitate the awakening of humanity. God is working with individuals all over the world to help bring this about. You have a great advantage here, beloved souls, for you have the unadulterated truth. As this truth is spoken, there is little room for misinterpretation. It is given plainly and succinctly as a gift to you.

Listen carefully. Listen to what is given and find the truth in it, the joy that the soul feels when hearing this truth. The capacities of your being are realigned in this truth. The gifts that you possess within your soul are awakened by this truth. In time, you will be transformed, changed irrevocably and given the opportunity to serve God in deep and powerful ways. God’s blessings pour upon you at this time. Open yourself. Allow what is given to flow freely within you. Allow your minds, your hearts, your souls to be in alignment with this gift and all that comes with this gift. You will find yourself upheld in light, a beautiful soul bathing in the Living Waters of God’s Love.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, in this sacred circle, this Circle of Light. May you honour each moment with eagerness and desire and openings of awareness. God gives you all that you require and shall do so as you progress in the Love of God. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Jacob and I am happy to come to speak to you today. My son, Emmanuel, I walk with you, I guide you and I protect you. God bless you, my son, and God bless all of you.
