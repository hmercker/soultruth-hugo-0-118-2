# The Beautiful Relationships You Have Created in Prayer Will Last All Eternity

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Andrew received by Al Fike

â€¦together may come to an end, beloved souls, but in truth, they will not. For you have created a bond together, a beautiful relationship in prayer that shall last for all eternity. You will look back upon these days together and see them as a beginning of coalescing as a family of prayer.

Beloved souls, you are truly blessed to have this time. Indeed, the outcomes and benefits of this time will not truly be known for some time to come. Yet, you will recognise and understand why you have come together for a purpose and for the benefit of your relationships with one another and with God in the Light and blessings of the Father's Love. They are given freely and abundantly to each of you and collectively poured upon you.

I am Andrew. I love you. I am grateful, happy and joyful that you have done so. You have answered the call. You have taken the time and used the resources at hand to make this possible. When one is motivated by love, comes together in love, the blessings are multiplied exponentially to your benefit and to the benefit of your brothers and sisters. Indeed, you will come together in various permutations, in various places in the world, to act as a channel for God, to be true to His Will and His plan.

Do you not feel this in your souls, my beloved brothers and sisters? Do you not feel the power building within that comes from the Father's Love? Do you not recognise the transformation that happens from this blessing? Do you not see that your perspective of the world, your perceptions, are changing and are in greater alignment with the perceptions of your soul and the wisdom therein? There is so much that is given from outside of you, so that you may give abundantly from within you and through you to the world. You collect the light within your soul. This has its transformation, the magic of God's Touch upon you, so that you become the light. You do so without even thinking about it.

It is a natural part of you, because you have chosen the greatest blessing of all. As you walk the world, that light emanates. That beauty is part of God's creation and it is uniquely yours. It is truly yours. My beloved friends, you are truly blessed, and we together have accomplished something that is unique and beautiful and will have far-reaching effects in the future. As you travel down the road of your life, you will find that God will utilise what He has implanted within you these days for the benefit of others.

May you be blessed, my beautiful friends, in all the ways of God's Love. May you express that blessing truly and deeply within you and through you for the benefit of others. May you see the world with eyes of love. May you embrace the world with the warmth of love. May you act within the world with the wisdom of love. May the power of Love be utilised to change the world from darkness to light. I am Andrew. I love you so, beautiful, beautiful creatures of light, children of God. God bless you. God bless you all in Light, Truth and Love.
