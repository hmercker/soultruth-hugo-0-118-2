Jesus & Mary received by Al Fike

**Jesus:** May the Essence of God enter into your souls. As God opens that door and the Holy Spirit comes, may you have the awareness, the feeling, the sense of the Holy Touch upon you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you as well for this flock so desirous of truth and love, are truly my brothers and sisters, for we seek the same thing. We continue on this eternal journey towards the truth and at-onement with God.

My beloved brethren, seek the peace that passes all understanding. As that door opens to your soul, may you enter into that place deep and abiding in light, peace and love, for this is where the nourishment of the soul resides. This is where the soul may feel its worth and know that it is loved. The soul is your true self, my beloveds. With this awareness and experience, then you come into yourself. You come to realise your worth, how profoundly you are loved, how beautiful is your creation, your being, for you are truly a creation of God.

As you come to God, open yourself fully and feel the inflowing of His Love. It seeks to penetrate every nook and cranny of your soul, to find its way into the dark corners and light them with Love, to be the powerful agent of change within you, to show you the way to truth, to open up all that is within you that God has created, bringing these things alive with His Love. The Essence of God's Soul will do its work and bring the transformation that is inevitable as you seek greater portions of this gift of Love. You will become a changed person, one who began as a soul, becoming human and immersed within the human condition but, once again, finding purity and grace in the Love of God.

Yet, in this journey of transformation, what you began as is forever altered by the experience of the earthly life and by the addition of your spirit body, all cloaking your soul. Thus, you are a different being. Thus, you travel a different path. Together, we acknowledge one another as unique creations of God, as His beautiful lights, filled with potential, filled with many gifts and, indeed, with the blessings of His Hand upon us, these gifts shall rise up and be expressed through us, each one in its unique form and expression.

Yes, we are brothers and sisters and we walk the Path Divine together, seeking true at-onement with our Creator, feeling and knowing the deep peace and joy that comes in this journey. As we pray, we are liberated from the burdens of the flesh, if just temporarily. We become a soul ascending into the Light of God and God's Light descending upon us. In this true communion of soul, we find that peace. We absorb the truth of our existence and we know the power of His Love. We are His children and we seek out at-onement. May we go together in this search and be in that bliss of Love, immersed in an ocean of Love so vast we cannot see its horizons or its depth, but we are with God in His blessing upon us. My beloveds, together we are in this light and grace. Together, we shall be nourished by the Living Waters of God's Love. Peace be with you, my beloveds, the blessings of His grace surrounding us. Open yourselves and take in this flow, this grace, these Waters, for they are yours and they are limitless.

May you be blessed, beloveds. Know that I am with you in this blessing, that I love you so, each one my brother and sister, each one a gift to the world. For your souls bring the light and affirm the truth. You are the harbingers of what God wishes for His children. Together, we shall share this truth and show the way for many who are seeking. God bless you, my beloved and beautiful friends on Earth. I am with you always and love you dearly. God bless you upon the journey.

**Mary:** I am Mary. I too come to bless you with peace, to envelop you in light, for God wishes these blessings for each of you. Indeed, within your soul there is a longing for such blessings. He sends His angels forth to help fulfil the true and purposeful desires of each soul in this world of yours.

When that sincere longing is present and faith carries the prayers to God, then the response will always be that of Light, Love and peace. It is given, beloved souls. It is given because you have ignited the laws pertaining to His Love. In this, you receive the benefits and blessings that come.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Mary and I love you. May the deep peace be with you. God bless you.
