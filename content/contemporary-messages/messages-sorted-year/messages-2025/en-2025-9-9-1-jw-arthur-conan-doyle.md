# Prayer, It's elementary!

September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Harrow Retreat, Harrow, UK

Arthur Conan Doyle received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Arthur Conan Doyle. So delighted to be here on the old sod. Though there have been many changes since my time here on earth, in this beautiful land, my country’s people still like a good mystery, and I could tell a tale. I had a knack for being able to see through the casual and lead my readers to see the little things that go unnoticed, the clues, sometimes right in front of their faces, the nefariousness of those vexed spirits, and, of course, coming to solve the mystery of the crime.

As you may know, I was a passionate spiritualist, though I could be considered agnostic regarding God. Then I discovered the channelings of my buddy GV, George Vale Owen, who is with us today, and I saw that simply knowing that there was life after death left a void in my soul, and the mechanical religiosity of the orthodox did nothing for me. But here was GV communing with spirits and angels through the spheres, piercing the veil, and leading a longing soul to the magnificence of the love of God embracing the natural and yet, what George received allowed one to go into the aspirations of their souls and to solve the great mystery of the beyond and the gifts given to each soul in the love of God, which as the dear brothers and sisters have spoken here today, does transform the soul. It certainly transformed mine. And so while mental acuity will help you discover the mysteries of life, spiritual acuity will help you expiate baggage that you no longer need, and it is your soul going into prayer. For prayer is the key that opens the heart, that allows the soul to receive the blessings of God’s love. Prayer, it’s elementary.

I thank you for allowing me this time, and I say lastly, pray that you may receive this great gift, to the glory of God and the gratitude and company of angels. If you put that in your pipe and smoke it, you will be changed, full of joy, and full of every good and perfect gift that our Creator wishes you to receive. From those here to all of you, may the love of God be with you. May you all be blessed. I thank you.

I am Arthur Conan Doyle.
