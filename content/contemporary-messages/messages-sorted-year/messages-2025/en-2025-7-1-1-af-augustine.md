Augustine received by Al Fike

Stand fast, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. Be in the Truth of God's Love every moment of your life. Stand fast in this Truth, for it is the greatest Truth and highest blessing you may receive in this life and the next. I urge you to stand fast, dear students. Do not let the intransigence of the material world draw you away from this Truth, from your prayers to be with God and from the openings of your soul as you ask for the inflowing of the great gift of His Love.

Though you must live your life, and life is certainly a gift, it is a matter of priorities, of focusing upon what is truly important that will bring you into the light, peace and joy that is your soul fulfilled in the Father's blessing of Love. God will allow you free reign. You are able to choose. You do choose each day. I merely remind you that, indeed, being with God, opening your soul and exalting in the precious Light and gift of the Father's Love will bring harmony to your lives, will put everything in order and will bring to you the perspective and the understanding of life that will bring you to a place of harmony and to a place of peace.

All other things in your life cannot do this for you, beloved souls. There is only one thing. There is only one way and that is to be in the grace of God. That is accomplished by receiving His Love, by routinely going to prayer and to be focused and steadfast in the desire to receive the gift. How many times have you thwarted God's invitation to receive His Love and His gift of Light? Each day offers you an opportunity to be steadfast in this Light and gift. Yet, there are days that go by when you ignore this invitation. There are days that go by where you are greatly blessed and gifted in Love.

It is for you to choose, always. I do not bring this message as an admonishment to you, my beloved students. Rather, it is a reminder that, indeed, each day offers the choice and each day offers great blessings, if you so choose to receive, to be open and to have the yearnings within your soul responded to by God's Holy Spirit. For when you are in alignment with God, you are deeply blessed. When you are in alignment with man, you ride the rollercoaster of ups and downs, of chaos and also joy. The intransigence of the human condition cannot be relied upon. It is the steadiness, the power and the glory of God's Love for you that never wavers and is always there for your benefit.

Choose the latter, my beloved students. You will find peace and fulfillment in your life. You will be a rock of light, of truth and of love for others. Many may rely upon you, beloved students. Many may come to you. Are you prepared? Are you steadfast in the truth? Do you see the power of this simple truth as your saving grace? If so, then you are equipped to be a channel of blessings for others and to be a light in the world. The dark conditions of this world of yours cannot touch you when you are in God's grace at all times.

The choice comes in your thoughts, your deeds, your endeavours and your desires. What you intend for each moment, each footstep, will determine the blessings that will come and the grace that may befall you. Are you willing to walk in the Truth of God's Love with every breath? If so, we are with you and God's Hand is upon you and with you. We shall surely be your friends. We shall protect you and we shall guide you. God's loving Hand will be upon you at all times, bringing its Light, bringing its peace that passes all understanding and bringing many blessings forth. May we go into the light, beloved souls, seekers of truth. May we be steadfast in the great gift of His Love. May we enter the Hall of Peace together, singing our hosannas to God.

God bless you, my students. I am your teacher, Augustine. I love you so. I reach out in love and acceptance. In the grace of God, we shall enter into the light, our souls open wide, our feelings of reverence and love for God informing our way toward greater light. God bless you, beloved souls. Augustine loves you, as do many. Be in the grace of God, my friends. We shall change the world together, bringing harmony, peace and truth with the power of love into your world. God bless you, loved ones. God bless you in life.
