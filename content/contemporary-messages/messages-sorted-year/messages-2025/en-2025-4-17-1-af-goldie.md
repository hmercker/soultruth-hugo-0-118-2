# When You Fall, Pick Yourself Up in Joy!

Goldie received by Al Fike

I see our dear brother has tripped and fallen on his road as he skips along, desiring to do God's Will. Each of you, when you fall, you must pick yourself up. Be joyful that indeed you continue upon the road, that you skip your way through life and that many, many blessings come to you.

Laugh at your own flaws, beloved souls. When you approach these things with joy and laughter, they do not seem so great. They lose their power because you do not give them power. Rather, you give the power of joy and light to your journey.

You will trip again. Each of you will trip at some point. Have compassion for yourselves, that joyfully you are on the path. God gives great latitude to His children, allowing them to fail. Yet, He continues with love.

May you continue with love, beloved souls. Be joyful and be at peace. I am Goldie. I love you. I love you all and I will laugh with you whenever you wish to express joy. God bless you. I love you.
