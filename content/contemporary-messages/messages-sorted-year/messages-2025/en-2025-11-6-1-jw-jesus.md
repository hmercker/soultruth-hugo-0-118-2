# Allow the great Blessing of God's Love to permeate your Being

Jesus received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the love of God be upon you. I am your brother, Jesus.

I come with the roses on this path of God’s love to be in this blessing with you.

When you feel defeated, pray. Overwhelmed, in doubt, or when you feel your faith has failed you, remember this time of prayer, and the times you have let go of the world to be with God, at one in His love. For God’s love has conquered the world, and all that we ask is that you be with us in this love, your souls alighted, your hearts in joy. When you send up your prayer, God responds. You can give God your troubles, your doubts, your guilt, your unforgiveness, and your mistakes. Let them go, release them, that you may move forward and allow our loving Father to fill you with His essence; to be at peace, to be calm through the storms of life. If your mind is busy, talk to God. I did this, if I may say so, unceasingly, and walked on the path that you are on. And though I did not carry any baggage, I became a transformed soul.

So, I say to you, let those things that you no longer need fall away, for what you gain will be so much greater. Have you not seen this in your lives? As you let go of things that were not worthy of your spiritual walk, it became lighter, and so it shall. If you persist in your prayer, you will find it easier than you ever imagined to transition into spirit when your time comes, as it does to every soul, and we shall be there for you, and you will wonder and marvel at the places that have been prepared for your immortal souls in God’s love.

As you have been instructed and guided, when you call on us, we shall come. It is really quite simple, and you have seen in your own lives the difference it makes when you ask, when you knock, and when you allow the great blessing of God’s love to permeate your being. My brothers and sisters, your future is of light and love, in the magnificence of the Father’s glory. Let it be yours and all of ours, as we are one.

I thank you. I bless you in the love of God. I am your brother, beyond time.

I am Jesus. Go in peace.
