# Your Soul Growth Is the Most Important Thing You Can Do on the Earth

May 29<sup>th</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am with you now. I am George, George Stokes. I live in the Celestial Heavens with many of my brothers and sisters, some of whom I knew upon the Earth. It is a glorious place, filled with Divine Love. Yet we come to you each and every time you gather in prayer to join you, to raise you above the Earth plane and to bring you closer to God.

We trust that you are able to feel the Love pouring down into your souls at this time. We relish these times with you, upholding you, blessing you, truly helping you to move forward in your progression. It is delightful for us to see you as you strive to receive the blessings that God has for each and every one of you. It is joyous to see your souls brighten, to see them opening, awakening and loving. It is not so difficult for us to come when you are in prayer. It is truly a blessing for us, as well as you, when we come to join you, for we love you dearly and we love to see how you are progressing.

Many of you do not know me. I was once upon the Earth, struggling with my humanity while teaching others about Divine Love. It is a struggle to be in the Earth plane, in the flesh and walk this path. Yet it is also joyous and, some would say, miraculous. God knows every one of you intimately and knows exactly what it is that you need to move forward in your progression. Each time you open your souls and ask for His Love, He responds with Divine Love that carries within it everything: truth, guidance and even those desires are fulfilled by this Love coming into your souls. That, in part, is why we encourage you to continue praying as much as possible and together as much as possible. For your soul growth is the most important thing that you can do upon this Earth, even under the weight of what you call the human condition.

Continue, my dear, dear children. Continue to pray. Continue to pray together. Continue to express this Love in everything you do, even the mundane things that are required when you have a fleshy body. Always keep God in your heart and soul so that you are always connected to the Source of all Love and all things that are perfect.

God bless you, my children. I will step back now and pray with you, as will all of us who gather around you, encircling you in this Circle of Love. God bless you. I am George and I love you each and all dearly.
