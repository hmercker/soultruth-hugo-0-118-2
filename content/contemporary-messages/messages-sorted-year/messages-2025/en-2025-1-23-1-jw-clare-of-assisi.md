# Prayer and Sanctuary

January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Nashville, TN, USA

Clare of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

My many dear kind mice. It is I, Clare. I apologize for my absence, but I will tell you that you have all done beautiful work in continuing to discover what awaits you in spirit and the importance of prayer. As you have read, prayer brings faith, and true faith overcomes fear and doubt. This is no small matter on earth, for in spiritual life, fear and doubt, and I should say self-recrimination, often confront one in their attempts to progress in the love of God. When you read between the lines of words that sometimes cannot be easily grasped by the intellect, you get a feeling for what is being said, and in that message from Judas, he is trying to lead you to that place of soul perception above the mind and in soul ascendancy. This is what prayer brings about, whether with words or with simple intention.

You may know the statement, *“Be still, and know that I am God.”* That is referring to this Presence (radiance) mentioned in what you read from the Judas book tonight. [^1] You often read about the importance of prayer, receiving the love of God, and bringing that love to the world. Of staying in the Presence in the midst of a very busy day. When one’s consciousness is in communion with God, which is prayer, one begins to see, amid ordinary interactions, a beautiful flow of grace. My sisters and I were very drawn to being silent, to being in prayer. But because we were human, we accepted the necessity of interaction, of service. Sometimes, a gentle touch of love is all that is required.

At present, the events on earth can seem overwhelming and can leave you in a state of helplessness or even a kind of despondency. This tells you there is work to be done, and that work is soul work, finding that quiet place, wherever it may be, making it your sanctuary, connecting with God from your soul until you feel His love, His presence, and His grace. “Be still and know that I am God.” These are important words.

Lastly, my dear kind mice, as you consider the days ahead, I encourage you to come together, as you do, and if possible, with each other in a place agreed upon where you can pray, where you can receive, where you can just be with your spiritual family. There is great power in spiritual desire and thoughts do become things. If you are concerned about making the right choice, the right place, the right time, then allow your souls to feel guided and above all, know this; what is done in love is good and what is done in God’s love and for His kingdom is great. May these things carry you forward.

With all my love and from all those here who embrace you, I shall step back, and I thank you for this time. I shall come and be with you again and again and I love you. I am your sister, in Christ, a redeemed soul in the celestial heavens. May it be your destiny. May God bless you.

I am Clare.
