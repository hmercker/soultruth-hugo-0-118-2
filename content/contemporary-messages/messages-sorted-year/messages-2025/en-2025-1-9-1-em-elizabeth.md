# To Be Open is a Gift

I am here. I am John's mother. Yes, the Baptist. I watch over all of you. I watch as you grow in your love, as you grow and develop in your gifts, in your abilities to transmit to other souls, those blessings that Father brings through you to other souls walking upon this Earth. It is a pleasure, a joy, to watch over you as you progress in your souls' gifts, for there are many who walk this Earth who are untouched by the Love of God. They do not open to receive and therefore cannot express what they do not have. They are closed, closed down.

To be open is a gift. Open enough, even with just a little bit of trust, to be able to feel the Love that is available to you. Open enough to be able to receive and transmit. It would be worthwhile for each and every one of you to pray to be more open to the Father's Will, to the Father's blessings, to the Father, that you may become a conduit for others upon this Earth in this life.

We warmly welcome all of you to pray for these moments of opening. As you become more proficient, more and more of God's Love and blessings will come to you. You will be utilized more and more by God to assist your brothers and sisters in learning to love. You see, this is really what it is about: learning to love. Take this time now and ask the Father to open your souls and know that that is what will happen. Allow that to happen, that you may experience the highest blessings, the most Love that you will ever feel.

May God bless you. My love is with you as you open your souls. I am the mother of John the Baptist. I thank you for coming here today and listening with your open souls. May God bless you.
