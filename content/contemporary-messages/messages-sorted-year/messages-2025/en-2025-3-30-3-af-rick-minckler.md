# Shares His Tears of Joy

March 30<sup>th</sup>, 2025

First United Spiritual Church, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Rick Minckler received by Al Fike

I am Rick Minckler. I too have enjoyed this service. I too am very happy to see the pews full, the voices clear and the light shining in the eyes of all of you and in this place. Oh, how it makes my heart full. I have tears of gratitude, my friends.

I am happy in spirit. Through what I have learned in this church and in my own endeavours, I have found my way from Summerland to the Third. I am happy to have done so. Oh, what awaits you, my friends. What this dear instrument, my friend, has told you is merely a shadow of what exists and what is there to fill you with hope, promise, truth and love.

God has provided much for all of us. I want you to take advantage while on Earth of teachings and promptings that will help you to advance much while you are here. For there will be a great payoff for you later, my friends. You will have all that you require to advance quickly in the spheres of spirit.

Blessings to you, my friends. Rick is here and loves you. I have never left. I am here often. I am happy to see this church grow and thrive. God bless you all in Love.
