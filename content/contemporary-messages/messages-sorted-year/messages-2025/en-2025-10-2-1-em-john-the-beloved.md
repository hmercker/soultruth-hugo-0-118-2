# An Experience in Applying the Law of Divine Love

October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

One Nation Circle of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Beloved and we welcome you all here. The Truth of the Law of Divine Love is that it encompasses all other laws and creates a smooth, loving environment in which to live your lives, whether in the Earth plane, the spirit world and, of course, in the Celestial Heavens. The operation of this law comes into play regardless of the circumstances in which you find yourselves. It is when you apply that Love to every situation in which you exist and that you attract. As you apply the law, you attract higher, more loving situations.

You each have Divine Love in your souls. You are each capable of manifesting this Law of Love from the Love that you possess at this time. It is a matter of free will to do so. As this medium has just proven, this law is in effect in a situation that was less than harmonious. As a result of the application of this law, harmony is spreading in this situation. A very good lesson to learn is that you have the power of your free will to apply laws that will benefit you in every circumstance, the highest of which is this Law of Divine Love, where you manifest this Love in any given situation.

We are truly grateful for this opportunity, for this teachable moment, not only for this medium, but for all who are in this circle. It is a blessing from God that this situation arose. It could have been applied previously in a similar situation. This is a step toward greater harmony in this medium's life and in front of these souls who have previously witnessed a less harmonious response.

May God bless you, each and every one of you. I am John the Beloved and my love is with you.
