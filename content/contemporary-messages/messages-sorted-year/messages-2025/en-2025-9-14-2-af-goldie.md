# You Defy the Conditions of this World Through Laughter and Joy

September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Goldie received by Al Fike

I am Goldie. When you laugh, you overcome the sorrow of this world. You have a desire to be defiant against the conditions of this world. In the laughter comes the feelings of the soul of joy, and so I love it when you laugh.

Continue to laugh, my friends. Continue to be defiant of the conditions that surround you. To uplift and delight in life is important. To be joyful is what God intends for every soul. To be true to your soul is to be joyful. My friends, laugh, laugh and laugh, for it is in laughter that the tonic for the weary world comes and the joy is recognised. In this, you acknowledge God in His Love.

I am Goldie and I love you and I laugh with you. God bless you, loved ones. God bless you.
