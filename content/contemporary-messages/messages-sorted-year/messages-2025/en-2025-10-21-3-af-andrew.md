Andrew received by Al Fike

My beloved friends, I am Andrew. This gift of the Father's Love, His Essence, the Essence of His Soul, is given through desire, desire to receive it, desire and openness through prayer. One must ask. One must seek it out to receive it.

Do not assume or take for granted that this gift is given because one thinks of it. Behind the thought must come the desire, the true soul desire to receive this gift, to humbly ask and to know and feel its inflowing. These things cannot be known, felt or received if there is but a casual, mindful thought behind a prayer. It is a yearning that comes from deep within that opens the door for this gift to be received. The yearning must become conscious and expressed to God. In this way, the beginning of the process of soul transformation and awakening comes step by step, blessing by blessing. It is given freely by God through the mechanisms of this expression of God, which we call the Holy Spirit.

You must draw these blessings to you, beloveds. You must be serious and intent on receiving this gift. There are no second measures here. There are true desires of the soul, heartfelt and predominant, as one seeks this gift. As the seeking becomes more intense, so the receiving is more powerful. As the power of this gift is felt, its burning entering into the soul becomes obvious and real as it pushes forward into the crevices of your soul, opening, eager to receive. Faith is born of this, true faith. Faith in the gift, faith in God, faith in your own soul. As faith grows, so does the desire and so does the experience. It must become a daily practice, an effort made so that it becomes ingrained within your life and your experience in life. That way, all the distractions and all the inhibitions are put aside and the true prayer, the true experience of receiving Divine Love, becomes foremost in your consciousness, in your prayers and your quietness to receive.

May you be blessed, my beloved friends, in all the goodness and wonderment of the Creator's Touch upon you, nourishing life, the blessings of the soul that shall open new passageways, new insights, new experiences and greater joy from within. For this is what will be given to the soul who is penitent and desirous of this gift. Once the momentum begins, the process becomes easier and the experience more intense. It is learning and experiencing this Truth that begins the journey. As you find your way to your true soul's desires, which are real and powerful within you, then your perceptions of life, your experience of life and your priorities in life will change accordingly. You will find fulfilment and joy in this experience, in this blessing and gift. It will change you, will change you from within and determine the expressions and light that is your soul growing and expanding in Love. It is Love that is the most powerful elixir of transformation and true spiritual growth. It is this gift from God and it will bring you to the highest of places and blessings as you seek it and know it.

I am Andrew. I love you all. I speak of these things for our dear daughter and the spirits that surround her, that they may know this Truth, come to understand it, as they are well aware of the light that is here and the angels that surround you. They are given an explanation of the truth in ways that are simple and understandable, that they too may grow in this gift, understand the power of this gift and the true blessing of this gift.

God bless you, beloved souls. Andrew loves you. I will continue to help, guide, educate and pray with you all. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
