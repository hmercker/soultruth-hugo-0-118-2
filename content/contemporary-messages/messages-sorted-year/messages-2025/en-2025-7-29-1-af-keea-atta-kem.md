Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

Oh, precious children of God, I am Keea Atta Kem. I come to declare and to emphasise how truly loved you are and how truly love is in your life. Love is all around you.

First and foremost, you are loved by God to such depth and breadth, it is unimaginable how truly you are loved. You are loved by us in the Celestial Kingdom. We truly love you and we are with you in love. The extent and breadth of that love is tremendous, as deep as the oceans, beloveds, and as wide as the sky. We love you. We love you. We love you. The bright spirits who diligently work on your behalf, do so as an exercise of love, to grow their love and to grow their dedication to the work that is to bring the salvation of humanity. Their love is great and they add to the great love that is all around you. Your loved ones, your families, your friends and those who work with you, their love surrounds you. Layer upon layer of love, my beloved friends. Beautiful, bright, glorious and uplifting love.

Now, what is so important is that you love yourself, for the more you can love yourself, the more open you are to all of this love that is available to you. It is not that this love makes you love yourself. The only Love that can do that is God’s Love. Yet, it is that when you grow your love for yourself by receiving the great gift of Divine Love, then all the barriers to the love that is around you will melt away. You will feel the joy and upliftment of great love. Allow this to be so. Allow the floodgates to be open and the love will wash over you, cleansing and healing you. So much is available. So much can be yours. Seek out love, my beloved friends. Most of all, seek love within. In this way, you will be a loving light, a beautiful gift to humanity that is so in need of love. Be love, express love and feel love in all its ways and permutations, all its expressions, all the effects that love brings, the blessings, the healings and the transformation. May they be yours, my beloved friends. You are worthy to receive this love and to accept and embrace this love.

My beloveds, in a world that is so lacking love, you know the Source. You know the ways to obtain it. You know all there is about Love of the soul as it continues to pour into you. Now utilise your knowledge, my beloved friends. Exercise it to love yourself, to love those around you, to love the bright spirits, to love your friends from far off, to love us and to love God. When this love pours from you and it declares your commitment to love, then you become a clear and beautiful channel for God where His Love may show up and pour through you and pour forth to many. It is all about love, my beloved friends, the power of love, the blessings of love, the light that is Love. This is what will change the world, but first it must change you. You must accept and embrace it, all of it, my beloveds. Feel it now. Have the grateful heart that says, *“Dear God, thank You that in creation, love is predominant and powerful. Love is what holds it all together, this universe of God’s creation. Dear God, I thank You for this. I love You. I love myself. I love the world and I love all the beautiful spirits and angels that come in love.”*

God bless you, my beloved friends. Keea Atta Kem loves you. I hope you can feel it, my beloveds, for it is strong and it is embracing you now. God bless you. God bless you all in the Father’s Love that is infinite and is yours forever. God bless you.
