Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. It is your teacher, Augustine. I ask you not to put your focus on or give credence to the conditions and opinions of the lost children of your world. There are many lost children in your world. They may have a high station or a low station in your countries, politics and religions, etc. They are eager to express their opinions, to garner attention and power. Yet, they know not what they are saying. They are not well-versed in truth. They are lost.

When you look to these individuals, especially those who garner attention and think of them as leading and giving sage advice, I say you are following a road that does not lead anywhere. The road you must follow is the road that God puts before you, where your soul gleans advice, counsel and perception from God. In your prayers and your desires, the inklings of your soul will continue to guide you forward and show you the way.

Yes, it is good to have compassion and to pray for these individuals who are so lost, but it is even more powerful and more effective to be an example in the world, to live in the world but not be of the world. For being of the world at this time is being a part of the human condition, so dark and so misguided. Rather, you must be in the world as a channel and beautiful instrument for God, to walk in the world in peace, in harmony and love.

When you react to others who are causing an uproar and conditions unfavourable and unloving, you join in the fray and become part of this condition. Rather, pray for your brothers and sisters. Pray for your families. Pray for your countries. Pray for the leaders of this world, for all is in turmoil and shall continue to be so. What is reflected in this often comes through in misguided efforts to correct those conditions that many are reacting to. Yet, they do so without true knowledge, true compassion and true harmony with God. Rather, it is the human condition played over and over again. Many of us in the Celestial Kingdom who have been there for a very long time see these human dramas continuing to play out and repeat themselves. As that famous adage indicates, history does indeed repeat itself. As humanity grows in numbers, the repetition and the power of that human play grow stronger and more destructive.

Thus, you are needed, beloved souls, to be examples, channels of love and lights in the world. If you occupy your mind with judgment, fear and reactivity to the behaviours of these children who are misguided, then you do little to help the situation. You do little to help correct yourselves and to be in greater harmony and peace together. I ask you to put your judgments and concerns aside, for humanity will play out these issues until a time comes when there is intervention and true reaction to these conditions, in such a way that all must respond, not by playing politics or power games amongst yourselves, but by going to God.

For when there is a crisis in an individual's life, often, where do they go? They cry out in anguish, â€œOh my God, help me! Oh my God!" in great despair. This is a calling from the soul, for that soul continues to be active within the individual, despite all the cluttering of mindful thought. You must listen to your souls. All upon the world must listen to their souls. When the conditions come to a crescendo, a peak, many will go to that place of soul, seeking solace from God. This will be your opening door, your opportunity to speak the truth to many, not in a way that is condescending or superior, but in a way that is humble, kind and generous, filled with truth, love and compassion.

My beloved children, students of truth, do not allow these conditions to harm your thinking and your actions. Rather, it is another warning that all is in turmoil and in the process of great change. Have faith in God's plan for the salvation of humanity. Have faith in your soul, your gifts of soul, the many things within you that God will utilise to help humanity through these crises.

You will grow in strength, beloved souls. Grow in perception and wisdom. Grow in love and compassion. This must come as you continue to pray and continue to ask God for the great gift of His Love. As this continues to flow within you, transforming and changing you, so you will find yourself in a place of peace, a place of centred strength and wisdom, a place where love will flow, where the guidance of God will be evident and where the presence of your angel friends will be all around you, surrounding you in love, light and protection.

There is no sense in your great concerns and worries. It will do you no good. It will not bring about what you so desire to happen in the world. It will not bring solutions. Yet, when you turn your focus to prayer, to be with God, to receive His Love, then comfort will come, and the soul will grow and awaken ever further in the truth. The gifts that you have will manifest in surprising and wonderful ways.

Seek out these things, beloved souls. Put your mind upon these things. Put your desires upon these things. God will answer your prayers every day, each and every breath. You will be utilised as God's servants, His channels of love in the world. This is what is important. This is what is needed. You are challenged each day by the human condition. Yet, each day you grow stronger, more versatile, more loving and wiser. So, it will be. The time will come when many look to you, beloved souls, for the answers. The truth will be spoken through your lips, the love will flow through your being, and you will emanate peace. Thus, you become God's instruments.

Beautiful, beautiful souls, may we seek the Love now, breathing it in, drinking it in. This great Substance from the Soul of God, offered to you in great abundance, flowing to you like a mighty river. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I will continue to guide, teach and uphold you. Through all that comes, we will be there, steadfast and never wavering. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. Augustine loves you dearly.
