May the Father's Love continue to awaken you, dear friends. I am Barbara. Every day is a gift from God. Whether that day be full of challenges, full of work and toil, or full of delights, it is a gift. Life is a gift. As you grow in the Father's Love and this informs how you feel and perceive the world, that gift is exemplified and you are given the opportunity, the opening, to learn and grow with each day.

For God is with you each and every day. God has given you life to live, not a life that is put aside and is drowned out by mindful endeavours, pain and withdrawing from its glories. Rather, when you engage in life, when you are truly a part of life, then the blessings multiply and flow in great abundance to you. The simple pleasures become wonderful, the daily toil becomes a joyful effort and the encounters you have with others become an opportunity to be a channel of love.

Life offers many things. Many things come to you because God has guided you, either toward them or brought individuals toward you. In this, your instrumentality, your way of service, is accomplished each and every day. If you are a light, no matter where you are, then God is using you. God is bringing light into the darkened room that is this Earth plane. As you continue to awaken to this light that is within your soul, then you come to see and appreciate the wonders that life has to give. Allow yourself the blessing of joy. Allow yourself to see the world through eyes of the soul, so that you may find joy and find purpose, that you may learn from what life has to offer and that you may express your soul and apply your gifts to the opportunities that God sets before you.

There are great blessings to be had, my beautiful brothers and sisters. There are great blessings to be given to you, but the door must open. The door is dependent upon your willingness to either allow that door to be opened or to open it for yourself. In both circumstances, it is an act of desire and will to be blessed by God or to be burdened by the human condition. This is your choice, beloved souls, this is your choice. Indeed, as you align yourself with God and feel the blessings of His Love within, the choice is obvious to choose light and harmony, to be at peace and to walk in the world in this condition of light. As you do so, you teach others by your example. You are a greater light as you continue to exercise light in the world, to give of your heart, to be a loving channel, to bring wisdom, caring and comfort to those around you. All of these things are an expression of your soul, and your soul has been claimed by God, together you and God, great blessings come and great life is all around.

My beloved friends, life is a choice and life offers many choices. Choose well. Choose with wisdom. Choose peace and light at all times. Be that channel of love for God and all will be well in your life, a life full of blessings, a life full of life. It is your choice, but God will ensure that you reap all the benefits and blessings of a life well lived, when the choice for light and the highest for Love and its blessings are expressed through your soul's desires and your mindful efforts.

God bless you, my friends. I am Barbara and I love you. God bless you.
