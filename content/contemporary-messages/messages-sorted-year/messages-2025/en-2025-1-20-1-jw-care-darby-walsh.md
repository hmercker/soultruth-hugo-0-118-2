Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear ones, it is I, Care. I come in this prayer with you, in this peace, my heart full of love, my soul lighted.

Having struggled in my time on earth, I wish you to know I have great empathy for your struggles, and that we are very proud of how you persist in knowing in your souls the truth of God’s love. Everyone who begins this journey has the revelation that the key to the door of God’s soul is prayer. So, over and over again, we remind you, we encourage you, knowing that every time you pray with all your heart, all your soul, God responds.

And, yes, there is a struggle. There are those times when you feel you are detached and wonder, “How do I get back into harmony? How do I get into the depth of my longings?” For this is the human condition. I too felt the weight of the world on my shoulders and on my heart. And what I discovered; I shall share with you. The walls surrounding the heart can only be dissolved in the love of God. Sometimes when I struggled immensely, I had to examine the blockage or the walls that seemed to exist, despite my deep longings between myself, my soul, and my Creator. I had to see my resentments, my unforgiveness, my anger, my doubt, my fears, my self-esteem, as well as my arrogance, and the list goes on. One simply must let go in that moment of prayer. Give it to God, that God may touch your soul. Your longing to be free from the weight of the world is answered in the bestowal of the great love of God.

When you are requested by another to pray, it may be very helpful to soulfully go through the litany of things that could be separating that soul from reaching out and encouraging them to let go. Because prayer is the very foundation of the path of Divine Love, it is of utmost importance. So, for me, I would look up to the heavens and pray *“Dear God, heavenly Father, open up my soul to the infilling of your love. I give you my troubles, my concerns, my worries, my doubts, my shortcomings, my failures. I wish to feel your presence so that your holy spirit may come and bring this love into my soul. I love you, and I thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Father.”*

My dear ones, my beloved, I thank you for allowing me this time. You are truly beautiful souls, and you are loved beyond measure. Go in peace. Do not worry. God bless you. I am Care. God bless you.
