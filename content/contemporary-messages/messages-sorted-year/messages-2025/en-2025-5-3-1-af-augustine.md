# It Is The Outliers and Non-Conformists Who Will Work Outside Norms of Society that Will Change the World!

May 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Augustine received by Al Fike

I am Augustine. Your groups will continue to be somewhat disparate, outliers, individuals who do not fit into the mainstream society. What encourages a soul to seek the truth? It is not in the contentment and ease of materialism. It is in the reaction to difficulties and cruelties implied upon the individual. They seek relief and they seek to be at peace. It is important to realise that the individuals that you will attract into your groups are not those who would comply to a standard, an idea of harmony and perfection that you may wish to impose upon them. Rather as you have compassion and love and you embrace these individuals, then you are doing God's work. You are a part of God's plan.

Indeed, those who are different are the ones that will assist in changing the world, not those who have complied to the standards and expectations of your material world. They unfortunately are more lost and more needy than those you encounter on your travels and those who join with you in your prayers. Though they are odd in your idea of what normality is, they are blessed, blessed of soul and desire to live outside of these cultural expectations and norms.

Thus, tolerance is important. I dare say that you might appreciate these differences, that you may see how creative is God and His creation, the uniqueness of each soul, how that uniqueness comes forth through that soul and to see that in God's garden, there are many flowers, many flowers, but they are not all the same. Rather, each one is unique. See the world and through these eyes of appreciating uniqueness and differences, of seeing that each one is human and has their issues, as you would call them, to deal with. This is inevitable. No matter who you engage with in the world, it is inevitable that each one must work through and cleanse themselves of those conditions that are not in harmony with love. Their approach may be different from yours. Their perspective is different from yours. Yet, each of you and each one who is part of this great family of love will continue to grow in Love and continue to find their way along the path of purification, of healing, of growing and of transforming in the Father's Love.

This you can be assured, my friends, that each one who takes up the banner of truth shall indeed find their way to truth. I know there are times when you are impatient and you wish all to come together in harmony and put aside, release those conditions that keep them from God and keep them from serving God. You can well imagine in our perceptions and our administrations upon you, if we did not have patience, where would we be in relationship with you? Yet, we will not abandon you. We will be consistent and persistent in our efforts and ministrations on your behalf and to your benefit.

We do not interfere with free will. God does not interfere with free will. You should not interfere with free will if you are God's agents. Indeed, be loving. Put aside judgement. Put aside frustration. Put aside impatience. Rather adopt acceptance, love and a peaceful demeanour. This will get you much further than the mind who insists on certain standards and ideas that must be applied in order for you to feel comfortable and in order for you to acknowledge the individual as worthwhile. This you cannot do. It is a very human perspective and we are encouraging a soulful perspective. The soul is a reflection of God and God has infinite patience. God has infinite Love. We encourage at least a portion of this perspective within you and the expression of your being and your efforts to embrace the disparate and unusual children who seek truth.

Yes, there are some that you feel more comfortable with and continue to engage with because they are nurturing to you and they are acceptable to you. Yet, what about the ones you have trouble with? What about the ones you judge and you are uncomfortable with their behaviour? They are children of God. You have asked to be a channel, a beautiful channel for God in all circumstances. I urge you, when you come to that place of judgement, when you come to that place where you are uncomfortable, look within. Pray for yourself that you may release these things. Pray for your brother or sister, whom you have inharmonious thoughts and judgments toward. Prayer will heal all conditions. Love will bring all peoples together no matter their perspective and no matter their condition. Love will melt away the barriers and bring harmony.

Consider this, my brothers and sisters. Consider your thoughts. Consider your actions in regard to your brothers and sisters. Be patient, wise, loving, kind and generous. Allow those things within you that are inharmonious to fall away. In this way, you will accept everybody in love. For when these conditions leave you, then what is there but love? What is there but compassion? What is there but realising that another's challenge may not be yours, but you have had your share and you continue to walk on the road of purification and releasing those conditions. Your brethren are also on that road with you. Be grateful and thankful for the opportunities that God has presented to you and how you may indeed find the opportunity to grow, to expand in Love and to be a light.

God bless you all. I love each one of you. I appreciate your uniqueness. Indeed, I see your flaws, but I even love those flaws within you, for this is what makes you who you are. Indeed, as you progress, we appreciate how these conditions melt away and you become who you are meant to be, a soul redeemed in God's Love. God bless you. I am your teacher. Augustine. I love you all so much. I appreciate you all, beautiful souls seeking to be beautiful lights. God bless you.
