# We Must Stay Close and in Harmony to Accomplish God's Plan and Purpose for Us

April 28<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Running Springs, CA, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

My brethren, I am your brother. I am your friend. I am Jesus. Indeed, I hope you see me as such, as your brother and certainly as your friend. For my love for you is great and my desire that we are close is great. I come to guide you and to uphold you, my brethren. We have a mission together. We have purpose that is ordained by God to help bring humanity to light and harmony in the world. We must be close. We must be strong in our convictions, in our dedications, in our prayers and in our desires, so that God may use us all in the plan and purpose of His creation and intention.

I wish for you to walk this path which is straight and narrow, to not venture away and be distracted by other things, but to truly be on this path, each footstep purposeful, each moment a prayer and light shining from you, not restricted, not kept to yourself, but shining forth in a clear expression of your beautiful souls, that you may walk the road of service powerfully and beautifully, that you may hear the guidance of God within your soul and heart and make this your mandate of life, to do God's bidding, to listen and know His Will, to be a light for God and a channel of love.

This is simple. No matter where you are or what you do in a day, ask to be used as God's instrument. Ask to be a channel of light and love. In this, you will attract the Celestial Angels and all that is of light will be with you, upholding you and in support of you and that they bring their gifts in the hopes of manifesting the gifts of their souls through you. God blesses us all in our efforts to serve Him and serve humanity. The simplicity of this is profound. Do not over complicate your ministries, but be upon that path firm, the straight and narrow. You will not waver. You will not be distracted, but will walk with a surety and a light that will touch many.

There are many seeking, my beautiful brothers and sisters. There are many in their hearts and souls who seek the truth. It is for you to give generously, first with love expressed, love in your eyes, love in your demeanour and love in your aura. This is most important. Then, if there is an opportunity to embrace that individual, then do not hold back. If there is a further opportunity to bring the message of love to them, then do so with the utmost of simplicity. If they are willing to join you in prayer, then invite them to do so, but always say a prayer for them, whether they are aware of this or not, for prayer is the powerful agent of God to bring a blessing to them.

This was my practice when I walked the Earth. I encourage you to follow my example and to be a true servant of God without adding complications, barriers, difficulties or disharmonies, merely to be that light, to walk this path and to shine forth, my beautiful brethren, upon the world.

May God bless you deeply with His Love. May you come to know it ever more profoundly. May you come to express it ever more beautifully. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I love you. I am with you. I am with you as you walk in the world. You walk with me and I walk with you as God's instruments of peace, love and truth. God bless you, my beloveds. I love you. I love you so.
