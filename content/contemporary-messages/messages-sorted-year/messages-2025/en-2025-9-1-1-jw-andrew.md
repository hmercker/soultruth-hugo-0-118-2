Andrew received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Andrew, the Apostle.

Brothers and sisters, how we love to see you come together, united in the love of God. I was an early follower of John, known as the Baptist, who introduced me to Master Jesus, and subsequently, I introduced my brother Simon, Simon Peter. And you know some of the story of us walking with the Master and some of the corrections that have been made, but there are deep truths, and I think one gets a sense, hopefully, when in prayer, of being fearless of being able to walk in faith. For many of us, this change happened at Pentecost, where we went from our own limited understanding of the teachings of Jesus and the path to God to really being changed, to being able to connect with God through His holy spirit in our walk, and walk we did to many places. We didn’t look at it as what you might call proselytizing, but simply awakening the world to the love of God, to the great truth of being able to be born again.

Imagine, if you may, for just a moment, having enough of a connection in God’s love with the Creator to allow crucifixion. For Peter and me, and many of the others were martyred, and I won’t say we were completely fearless, but we knew that we could not die. We felt the essence of the love so strong that I could say, one could say, we vibrated at a higher frequency. The frequency of God’s love was in us, and when we preached, those who came could feel it. Many were healed. Many, baptized in the love.

And, yes, we had very humble beginnings and we certainly were not educated in the sense that you view education in your world, but we had some insight and as we awoke from our humaneness, our sleep you may say, it was as if we were walking in light, and we so desired for God, Who had put the light in our souls, to bring it to others. We did this unceasingly. It was our prayer and our walk.

I tell you all this because you will come to the point of crossing over, and as you become more changed and immersed in this great love, you will not be concerned. You will walk in grace and in faith, and although no one’s walk is perfect, you will allow the love of God to perfect your soul beyond the body that you inhabit, into spirit. Whatever your prayer, however your soul chooses to connect, you will feel this oneness, this splendor.

So, I will remind you that when you pray, to let go of your doubts, of your worries, of your fears, of your anger, of your unworthiness. Come as a child to the Father. Be embraced. Be changed. For you will not die but live in love.

I hope I have shed some light on this issue and on the necessity of prayer, for truly it is an issue between you and God. And lastly, I say, when you come together, you bring a greater light, not only into this circle of beautiful souls, but stretching out across the earth, and we come and bring our love and our light, in God, to you. We are one. Are we not?

With all my love and blessings, I shall step back, and I thank my brother here for taking this message, and I thank you all for coming to this circle. May God bless you. I am your brother in Christ. I am Andrew.
