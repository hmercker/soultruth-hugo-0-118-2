# The Circle of Open Hearts

February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Nashville, TN, USA

Clare of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, Claire. I come to this circle to honor you, you of open hearts, you who have allowed the soul of God to open up your souls in love. As you pray and thy eye becomes single, thy will aligned with the great will of the heavenly Father, one begins to perceive the flow of grace encompassing not only the world you live in but all worlds, even encompassing those out of harmony, unaware.

The love of God is a substance so fine and yet so real that once felt, once received, there is a knowing this is the path. This is my desire. This is my bliss, my joy, my salvation.

May this love penetrate every being in this circle, seen and unseen, here and beyond. So many come to join you. Hearts full of joy in celebration of your new-birth-days, at one in the love of God, born again, truly.

Lastly, I say, be mindful of God. Be heartful of the world and be soulful in your prayers that you may walk upon the earth, a light unto all, a light in the darkness, a blessing.

With all my love and the blessing of all those here, in the love of the Heavenly Father, I step back. May God bless you.

I am Clare.
