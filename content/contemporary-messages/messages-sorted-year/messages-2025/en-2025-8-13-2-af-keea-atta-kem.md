Happy Mediums Development Retreat, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, this is Keea Atta Kem. Soul development can be a very complex thing. When it is at its most potent, it is the result of all aspects of your being in alignment with soul, that there are no obstructions, conditions, thoughts, even physicality, that obstruct the expression and the awakening of the soul. As you well know, the potent blessing of Divine Love is key and is the first component, the most powerful component. As that Love grows in your soul, the constrictions of encrustments fall away.

Yet, the soul must be nurtured and acknowledged and feel loved and know love. When love exists within you in all the ways that love can exist, then you have created an ideal environment for the soul to develop and awaken. This is why we have asked you not to segment your spiritual life, but to integrate all parts of your life into the spiritual so that you may find harmony and peace, that you may allow and be receptive to the communications your soul has for you and to you. If you are out of balance, so to speak, then it is more difficult. Indeed, for anyone who lives upon this earthly plane, the possibility of being out of balance is great. One day you may feel in alignment and well- balanced in your spirituality, another day you may feel out of sorts.

Not all of this is a result of your doing. It can be attributed to the conditions in the world and who you are with and how you start your day. How do you focus your thoughts and your actions? How are you feeling, that feeling part of you which is very important, the emotions that you carry that augment the thoughts you have? There are so many elements within each human being. God did not create something so very simple, that the road to true spiritual progression and soul awakening is swift and easily obtained.

Be attentive, beloveds, of those things within you that are moving, that are expressing, that are contributing to all that you are. Finding the balance often comes through prayer. You are asking God to bless you and your angels close in rapport. That way external conditions and some conditions that are internal can be harmonised and darkness can be dispersed in order to set the stage for deeper prayer and deeper contemplation. This brings you to a place of soul awakening and soul awareness. If your prayers are casual, your desire weak, your mind in disarray and your body causes you distractions, then the experience of prayer and being with God, opening yourself up to your soul and being in spiritual alignment and harmony is greatly inhibited by these factors. Because you walk upon the Earth, many of these factors are evident and sometimes very strong and cause upset or possibly a sense that you are in a vacuum and nothing is happening in your prayer.

Yet, when that prayer reaches its mark and your soul opens readily to receive the gift of God’s Love, you feel your angel friends close and any mental or physical distractions are not part of the prayer at a distance, then that harmony of your being gives to you a wonderful feeling. A sense of being truly in alignment with God and knowing the peace and the joy, the Love flowing in, the upliftment, light bright around you. This is what you must strive for, my beloveds. It is not easy in this world of yours. It is not easy because there are things within you that inhibit, that need your attention, that need your prayers, that need to be released.

Each of you are in a different place upon this path of soul awakening. Some of you have much to clear away. Others have been working diligently to clear away the debris and the obstructions, but all of you have your challenges. Indeed, it is only prayer, a measure of discipline and a measure of application of those things that assist you in harmony. This way, when you are consistent in making those efforts, in being aware of what efforts are necessary and being truly in a state of longing and desire for God, then the powerful blessing, the great Touch of God, will be felt and felt beautifully and deeply.

So much requires your focus, attention, desire and love. Yet, your souls long for this. Your minds desire this. Indeed, as your consciousness in both centres continues,  communications happen and blessings are given, then the road becomes clear and the effort to remove the debris is successful. You will know a life of joy, being close to God, being close to your angel friends and being close to your inner self, your soul. When these things are in alignment, there is nothing that gives greater joy and fulfilment. We beseech you time and time again to consider what might hold you back and what might propel you forward. You have been taught many times of these things, many messages, hundreds of messages that give you the roadmap to harmony. It is not a complex thing in terms of what you may ask for and what may be blessed and given to you. Complexity comes as you duck and dodge your way around those things that inhibit, constrict and obstruct.

That is the difficult path, the complex path. With faith, desire, prayer and some discipline, you will avoid these pitfalls and come along the road clearly and beautifully as your soul awakens and develops in Divine Love. We are with you and we continue to walk with you and be with you. For anything that we might do to help you in this way, we make great application and prayer. In this regard, it is for you to accept, to open, to be receptive, to desire your true awakening and not let the distractions of the world hold you from this most important pursuit.

Be true to your soul, beloveds, as you continue on your journeys. Do not allow anything else to gain that place of priority and importance. It is with your relationship with God that all dilemmas can be solved, all conditions can be brought into harmony and all darkness will dissipate. The power of God’s Essence is the greatest power in the universe. You have yearned, asked and desired to receive it. This Essence is given to you freely by God. We continue on this journey of what is often called the Divine Path. Stick with it. Do not be distracted. Be consistent, be arduous in that consistency and truly desirous of knowing, experiencing and nurturing your soul in God’s Love.

God bless you, beloved ones. I am Keea Atta Kem. We journey together each and every day. We journey together toward greater light and harmony, toward the development of our souls in all its beauty, finery, complexity, aspects of soul that are yet to be revealed, that are going to be part of your life and an important part. Be excited, wanting to know and experience these things that are truly within your soul. God bless you. Keea loves you. God bless you.
