# Release the Prattle of Your Minds to Let the Fun and Freedom Begin!

January 11<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Goldie received by Al Fike

When the mind is released from the prattle, as our dear friend says, the fun begins. The joy begins and the freedom begins. Is this not what you all desire? To be in the glorious and beautiful flow of God’s Love? That there be joy and there be fun and celebration of life. What life is truly meant to be, what life is when unencumbered by the seriousness of the mind and the seriousness of your Earth. Elevate, my friends, elevate beyond that to a place of joy and light and love. Then you will know the freedom that I speak of, the joy that must come and the fun that awaits.

My beautiful friends, let go of the prattle and come to be free, joyfully so, and I will come and dance with you in the Light and Truth of God’s Love that is all joy. All joy. God bless you. I love you. Goldie loves you, beloveds. God bless you.
