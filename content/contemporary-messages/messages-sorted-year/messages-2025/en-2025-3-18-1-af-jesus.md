# Is Today the Day?

March 18<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

…the Father’s Love be bestowed upon you, my beloved brothers and sisters. I come. I am Jesus. I come to be with you. Is this the day where the Holy Spirit will touch you to such a degree that you will feel struck and changed by the power of it, the power of God's Love flowing, touching your soul, opening your soul and bringing its transformative blessing to you? Is this the day, my beloveds?

Only you can determine that. Only you can pray for this gift. It does not come any other way. It must come in accordance to the power of your prayers and the intensity of your desire. It must come because you have opened the door for its inflowing through the application of your will and desire, in prayer, to ask and receive this gift.

Is this the day, my beloveds, that you will be uplifted to that place so sublime, so much in the Father’s grace, that it will change you forever? That possibility exists. It awaits you at this very moment, but it must come at your bidding. I beseech you, my beloved brothers and sisters, to seek this Love in earnestness and prayer, to ask with all your heart and soul, to allow the true longings of your soul to burst forth from your heart to God. In this, God will respond in like measure. In this, the Holy Spirit will fly to you, coming in response to your earnestness and touching your soul deeply.

Is this what you desire, my beloveds? Do you wish to truly follow me upon this path of Love? For you need this gift to enter into your soul in order for you to follow this path and to be with me as truly my brother and sister. My earnest desire is that you indeed come into that communion with God and that you feel, with the intensity and longing within, the power of that Touch and the power of Love, Love Divine, entering into you and residing there for all eternity. Together we pray for this gift. Together we send longings forth, the power of which is multiplied by the unity of your desires. In this, we are all blessed, beloveds. In this, we shall receive the bounty, the treasure that the soul seeks.

My beloveds, we are in the grace of God at this moment. Now is the time to send forth your earnest prayers and be with God. As you do so, God sends His angels to your side, assisting you and praying with you, your friend in the truth, your helper that assists you in your realisation and revelations of truth.  God provides all that you require, all that you need to truly be touched and awakened in His Essence, flowing like falling water upon you and within you. Awaken, beloved souls, to all that is of God and all that is of your soul. We shall do the merry dance of joy, of acknowledgement of how wondrous is God's Love and how wondrous is our soul.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you. I am with you. We are with God and all the grace that is His Touch, the peace that passes all understanding, the joy of our soul welling up and recognising its Creator. Be present, beloveds, with this experience and know its blessings. I love you. I love you, beloveds. Be fulfilled in love.
