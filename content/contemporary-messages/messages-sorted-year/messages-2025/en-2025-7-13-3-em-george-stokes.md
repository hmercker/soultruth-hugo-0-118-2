George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am George Stokes and I live in the Celestial Heavens. I say to you, as you grow in this Love, you grow in wisdom. It is this wisdom that we ask you to practise on a daily basis, that you may become more familiar with this gift within your souls.

I know some of you are wise in a material way, but this is a different kind of wisdom that I speak about. It is a wisdom that is beyond the material. It is a wisdom that comes from deep inside yourselves, from your soul. With it comes a knowledge of laws, influences that your mind may not be aware of. In exercising this wisdom of your soul, your soul takes into consideration those influences, such as the laws, as well as your own inclinations, your true inclinations, and your true desires.

Approach each day with the understanding that wisdom comes from your soul and apply it to your decision making. As you grow in this Love and in this practice, you will become more familiar with your own soul and with the wisdom that comes with Divine Love.

May God bless you in your endeavours to practise this gift. May God bless you. I am your brother George and I am always available to help you.
