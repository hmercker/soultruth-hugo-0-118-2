# Explains Spirit is Working on Our Central Nervous Systems and Synapses of the Brain for Clearer Communication

January 18<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Seretta Kem and I am in charge of this time that you spend together in development. All that we do is predicated upon receiving the gift of Divine Love and everything that happens here is embedded in that one great gift, that one great blessing. So, my friends, I would urge you to continue in your prayers when you are together. I want you to know that as you rise higher into conditions of light and are more dedicated in prayer, earnestness in prayer, then our work is made easier and the efforts that we make will have greater effects.

As this beloved son indicates, there are many aspects of this work of development that we are engaged in. We are especially interested in the nervous system and the synapse of the brain, the wiring, as you would call it. We make efforts to realign the energetic flow through these systems in order to bring it into greater harmony, in order that you may have clearer communication with us in the spirit world.

Because of the evolution of humanity and the focus of humanity, these intuitive structures that have existed from the beginning either lay dormant, or they have been altered to such a degree and affected by chemistry and experience in life that they are buried beneath signals and currents of energy that are more adapted to the material world that you live in. When humanity first came upon the Earth, the first parents, as they are called, had a lighter body. They were in conditions that were more attuned to God and to spirit, although there were no spirits at the time, they were the first. As time progressed, the body solidified into a certain structure, a way of being that reflected the conditions around them. Thus, many of you have lost these sensitivities.

It is our job to resensitise many of you. Some are born with greater sensitivity in this regard and some have very little, but all have the potential for this sensitivity and this capacity to know us. As you continue to pray for God's Love, awakening your soul, this too plays its part. This too opens up the channels of communication and awareness, that those senses within you that are not of the immediate kind may be opened and may work to your benefit.

There is much clearing to do, much that needs to be released, even the healing and purification of your physical self, in order for this to be more readily available to you. The soul, of course, plays a very important part in this communication, because you are attempting to communicate with Celestial Angels. The great Law of Rapport dictates that you are close to us because your souls have welcomed and invited the blessing of God's Love, this great Light that indeed transforms the soul.

An important aspect of communication with us lies within the soul and its development. The outcomes of conscious communication with us are reliant upon those aspects of your physical and spiritual systems that allow for conscious communication. I urge you to be aware and sensitive and open to what we wish to accomplish, because I believe that each one of you has a desire to be closer to us and consciously so. We are happy that you wish this. We will continue to help foster this benefit, this blessing, this gift. As I have said, each of you possesses this gift to some degree or another, in one way or another, but it is predicated on these basic principles.

We will begin with the basics for many of you. Some of you have already been well-developed and others are eager to be developed. We will utilise those who are well-developed as intermediaries and batteries, as you call them, to help in this development. We also utilise chemistry in this process. Each of you carries your own mix of chemicals. We will utilise that which you have in excess that is beneficial to the development of mediumship and we will share them with others. For you have no need of the excess and you will not be depleted by this.

We will also be attempting to communicate as we go along, testing it as you will. You may have visions, you may hear voices and you may feel physical pressure on your body. You may feel flows of energies and sense that there is someone close. Do not be frightened or perturbed by these things, but welcome them. For these are all a part of your development and what may be a manifestation of that development. I wish for each of you to relax, be open and prayerful, to be at peace and to trust in what is happening as a blessing, an awakening of gifts. We will continue to speak of these things as we go along in the process.

I thank you for listening to me. I am Seretta Kem. Indeed, we welcome our beloved medium to my right to also speak on matters of development and blessings. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
