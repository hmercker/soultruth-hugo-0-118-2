# Political and Spiritual Conditions in Estonia Will Get Worse

September 15<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Stephen received by Al Fike

It is good that you have come here at this time. I am Stephen. I was known as St. Stephen. I am a Celestial Angel, and I have interests in the peoples of this land and the struggles that they have. Indeed, the struggles will not get any less as political and geological upheavals continue to make times worse for all who live here.

It is not that these beautiful souls, inhabitants of this land, are garnering any special attention from God or punishment. This is not the case at all, but the entire world is beginning to undergo great changes and upheavals. Indeed, the political landscape here is very tenuous and difficult as well. Spiritually, every soul in this area is challenged greatly. There are so many contradictory forces involved, so many issues that are unresolved. Yet, through all of these conditions, there is the Love of God that can be relied upon to help bolster, heal, guide and comfort. This great gift from God may be used as a great fulcrum to lift up those who are suffering, those who are confused and those who are in the dark.

It is for you, my beloved friends, to support and uphold, to teach and to guide. You have done so with your brothers and sisters. We are happy of your efforts, your time, your focus upon this part of the world. It has made a difference, and the outcomes of your efforts will multiply and bring a measure of comfort and light to this part of the planet. This is why you are called here, my friends. This is the purpose that you have had some difficulty understanding, but you have felt satisfied in your heart and soul at the end of this time you have spent with these people. That is because the goals that have been set forth have been reached.

Of course, it is always a matter of free will choice with the individuals whom you have connected with, what they might do with what you have given, how they might change with the blessings that have poured upon them, how they might shift in their awareness and desires in life. It is always an effort that may go in the direction of light or may not. Wherever you go, beloved souls, you may be that channel of light. You may offer your love, your support, your wisdom, but each individual must decide whether they will accept and utilise what is given, or whether they will turn away and remain within the patterns and ways of life that have previously served them in the material sense.

It is important that you realise with humility, that you give without judgement, without expectation, but with love, unconditional, with faith, faith in your Heavenly Father and the guidance that is given, understanding that when you step forward as an instrument of God, you also are blessed and those around you are blessed and this is the only expectation you might have. The outcomes are difficult to see, because with every life, there are a multitude of choices made, often in a meandering path leading toward light, but not necessarily directly ascending into love. You add your light and your wisdom assisting another on their path. God is pleased that you have made that effort, that you are that channel, that you have been loving and accepting, generous, kind, that indeed your prayers are for upliftment, for truth, for all that is of light. Indeed, God has answered your prayers, and you are blessed accordingly.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I thank you for the efforts you have made. My love is with you. I am Stephen. My love is with you. God bless you.
