Augustine received by Elizabeth Mack

God bless you. I am Augustine and I come with my love pouring into your soul. You are blessed in many ways, dear children of God. Yet, you still do not believe. It is true that faith is different from belief, but belief can imperil you from the knowledge of faith. When you receive this Divine Love into your soul, to that extent, you receive divinity, a part of what God is. But do you recognise it? Do you believe it? Do you understand it?

Most of you do not, so I come to help you recognise and suggest to you that you pray to recognise the divinity in your souls and, for some of you, to accept the truth that part of your soul is divine. Furthermore, ask God to explain to you what is meant by divinity and then open your souls and listen. Allow what God has to tell you to come into your souls and the inspiration will come in your awareness.

It may come quickly or it may take a while, but if you pray and ask to understand what this divinity means to each one of you in your own souls, this will become a guide for you to know something of your journey toward God. The Father provides many guideposts for His children, but to recognise them is one thing, to acknowledge them is another and to set aside any false beliefs you may have that keep you from fully embracing and possessing this knowledge is quite another.

My dear children, pray to be open to receive God's explanation, for lack of a better word, of what divinity in your soul means. I may say it is highly individualised for each soul. This will get you on your way to a greater understanding of your journey, which is very individualised. I hope you take in all that I have said and act upon it. Pray to God and come to know your purpose and your journey.

I am your brother Augustine. It is my privilege to speak to you today and through this medium for the first time. God bless you. God has so many blessings to give to you. Open your souls to receive them, as we Celestial Angels surround you, protect you and give you our love. Bless you, dear children of God. Bless you.
