# Carry the Flame of Love and Truth 

September 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am with you in prayer, a blessing of peace, a blessing that shall sustain you, for I come in love and care for my brothers and sisters. Blessed are those who carry the flame of truth in a world that is dark. May you be strong and faithful and carry this flame for all the days of your life and follow the Will of God that shall sustain you, that shall awaken you and be your guiding light upon the path of service, a path that shall bring you to many souls seeking, many who desire the truth within their souls.

May God put the words upon your lips. May God bring the Holy Spirit and that Love to flow through you and touch others, bringing comfort, peace and truth to them. There is much work to do, my brethren, much work upon this path. I beseech you to strengthen your faith, your prayers and your desires to serve. In this, God will guide you forward and give to you all that you require to serve in love, to be a true and effective instrument of His Will and His plan for the salvation of humanity.

My beloveds, the grace of God's Touch is upon you. May you open to all that God has to give. We shall walk together upon a glorious path of light and be in the true peace, the true understanding, the true Love that is of God. God bless you, my beloveds. I am with you, your brother and friend. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you in His peace.
