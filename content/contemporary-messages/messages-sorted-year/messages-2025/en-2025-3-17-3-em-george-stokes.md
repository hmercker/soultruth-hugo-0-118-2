George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am George Stokes. We come from different backgrounds, all of us. Each individual comes from a place that only we occupy. Our desires to move forward together is a blessing given by God so that none of us would feel alone. It is best to pray together for a single purpose, for your prayers are then strengthened and as you are devoted to transforming your souls, this may be the focus of this prayer and many others.

You may also choose the following of the Father's Will and the transformation of humankind. But by focusing your prayers, you will in effect strengthen and brighten the beam of light that transmits the signal of Love across the universe. Intense prayers as a unit will bring about all that you all desire. Unity and harmony is the key in your prayers.

I give you my love. May the Father continue to bring His Love into your souls. I am George. God bless you.
