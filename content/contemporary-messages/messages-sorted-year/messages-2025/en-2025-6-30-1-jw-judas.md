Judas received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, your brother, Judas.

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ, you have come a long way on the journey of the heart, on the path of the soul to redemption and immortality. All the mediums in Divine love have given you an immeasurable amount of divine truth, never perfect, but always quite worthy. For the knowledge of truth, spiritual truth, can change an incalcitrant mind, a reluctant heart.

Much of what organized religion has relied on has brought fear, talking about eternal damnation and those who are the chosen ones and the crucifixion, and so forth. Of course, when one can see beyond those limitations and false beliefs, they often do so with an open mind, willing to consider a new point of view, perhaps seeking out the highest truth, their motivation being one of wishing at-onement with love, with freedom from the limitations that they once held.

And so, you see all this information that delights the curious mind, that informs the seeker of divine truth and the soul’s journey and the spirit world and most importantly the love of God, these truths are surely most important for every seeker, for every true aspirant to be lighted, to be changed. And as John wrote, quoting Master Jesus, ‘Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free’, free from error, free from fear, often referred to as the glad tidings.

And beyond the knowledge of divine truth is the soul and its aspirations to feel, to feel God’s presence, to feel the love, not only in the soul but through the entire being. To go beyond the understanding of truth in the becoming of it. For a soul redeemed and transformed is living proof, living truth of the gospel of God’s love and of the great love of the Creator showered upon every soul who seeks it earnestly with great faith and earnest aspiration.

What is now your present state of being is becoming, becoming something beyond what the mind can conceive, what the body, the physical body, is capable of, and what the true self, your soul, is born for. For the Creator wishes every soul to become at-one in His love, lifted above the earth plane and its concerns. So, we always say to you, don’t worry, be not afraid, for you have taken a step on the path beyond fear, beyond concern. You have walked into the light, and the presence of God is upon you and in you for the asking.

I shall step back with you in your wonderful circle of love and join you in your prayer, and I thank you. I am your brother in Christ and your eternal friend. I am Judas. God bless you all, each one.
