# Desire and Soul Perception

May 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Yogananda & Francis of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, **Yogananda**. I come in the love of God, your brother in Christ.

In the message that was read, beloved Thomas talked about his desire for proof, and I wish to speak about the many desires of the senses. There is a very strong desire to take care of the body when one is hungry, when one is ill. There is another desire of the heart that longs for love and to love. There is the desire of the mind to acquire knowledge and wisdom, that one may move through the world with intelligence and there may be a deeper desire to serve, whether it is through discovery, science, medicine, feeding the hungry, housing the homeless, and of course praying with those who desire the gift of the Father’s love. You have come here with the desires of your soul to be at one with its Creator, to be transformed, to be free of whatever is weighing you down. For the weight of the world can truly be a burden, whether it is physical, psychological, or emotional. The desire to be lifted up in soul to the realms of light and love, and to connect with the celestial kingdom where the love of God is unceasingly present in glory, will bring you great joy.

We come, our hearts full of compassion and love for you. We come to this circle to inspire and to guide, and to the extent that we are able to do this, we are delighted, for we have nothing but love for you. Yet beyond all the help and love and inspiration we can bring you is the great love from the soul of the Father that is received in your soul in at-onement with His essence. So, we always encourage you to open up to the great infilling of Divine Love.

Give your troubles to God, your concerns. Is He not the bestower of every good and perfect gift who offers protection when you are in need and whose grace puts you into the flow and harmony of His will when you let go and you allow this communion, this holy blessing to permeate your soul and lift your being?

I thank you for this time, and I speak as an inhabitant of the celestial realms. This great truth that you have discovered will carry you to our shores in the Father’s kingdom. May God bless you, each one. I am your brother and eternal friend. I am Yogananda.

I am here, your brother **Francis**. I often come with brother Yogananda and delight in his presence here in the heavens. For though we did not live during the same time, we were connected spiritually while he was on earth. There is not much I can add to his beautiful message, except to say, for those of you who are in the northern hemisphere where it is Spring, I encourage you to go out and take your footwear off, rest your feet on the earth, whether it is in the grass or the sand or even just the mud. Breathe in the air and smell the fragrance of the trees and the flowers. Gaze up to the heavens in gratitude for Creation and send up a prayer.

Both my brother Yogananda and I have spoken about the senses and the sixth sense in particular, being intuition, where the mind has a hunch and informs the brain. We have also spoken about the seventh sense, which is soul perception. So, in concordance with the message of today and the desires of the soul, I shall add the great gift of soul perception that comes when one is rested in the love of God. As you know, I gave up the world and I received the treasures of Heaven. So, be not too attached. Enjoy the Earth and its blessings. Drink of the pure waters of God’s love, the living waters, that your soul may be refreshed.

There are many here, and we all wish a great blessing upon you all, such wonderful souls in such a beautiful circle of light, desiring of the highest. I shall step back for the remainder.

With all my love and blessings, I am your brother in Christ, Francis. God bless you.
