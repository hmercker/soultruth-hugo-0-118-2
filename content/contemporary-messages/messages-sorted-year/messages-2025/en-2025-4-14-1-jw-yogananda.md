Yogananda received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Yogananda.

I come in the love of God to this wonderful group of souls.  I wish to speak a bit about Divine Love yoga, which is a subject I have touched on through my brother here a few times, but I have noticed that many have difficulty in getting quiet, in settling down in the body, releasing the mind and their thoughts so that they may be open to receiving the love. Now, there is a reason that not only yogis, but mediums often ask those who are meditating or in satsang with them to sit in a certain way, comfortably upright, sometimes in a yogic position like the lotus or some easy pose or gentle posture. The reason is that once the body is in alignment, in harmony, and allowing the flow of bodily energy, it is much easier not to be distracted, as in the same way you would wish to have a peaceful, quiet place to pray or meditate.

In the yogic tradition when I taught Kriya Yoga, which was designed not only to align the body and relax it, but allow the energies to come up through the chakras for a state of equanimity and harmony it was most important to have certain postures, but as you should know, to receive the love of God one does not need to be in any particular position, except perhaps to say the position of the heart with the longings of the soul. So, the heart, this center called Anahata in yoga, meaning unstuck or clear, is your center.  You may see pictures of Jesus and his sacred heart, and thus, in my tradition, he would be considered a bhakti yoga practitioner, practicing the yoga of God’s love and devotion. So, first and foremost is the heart.

Now, for those who have difficulty quieting the mind, to just be still, I suggest you may want to focus on the chakra that goes between the eyes and above, Ajna, it’s called, and it’s between the brows. This chakra is the place of visions. When one sees something from spirit it is coming through this center. And so, in the context of quieting the mind, when one relaxes the heart and the body, you may wish to, when you close your eyes, just gaze upward gently, without any difficulty, gently gazing up towards the heavens, where sometimes you will see some light. This allows the connection between the heart and the mind to open to the aspirations of the soul to receive the love of God.

In the ancient yoga traditions, there are six chakras, but later on, there was the discovery of a seventh, Sahasrara, or the ‘Crown chakra’, rising from the top of the head up to the heavens. It was believed that this is the place where the soul leaves the body at death. But I say in your practice, as you open your heart to God and you gaze gently and allow the mind to be quiet, the showering of God’s love will come through and down into your soul. So, those of you who find it difficult, I encourage this very simple yogic practice. Bring it into your prayer life, your meditation. It will not only benefit your soul and its progression, but it will also benefit your body and your mind.

Let us be still. Let us allow all our longings to go to God. Let us open our hearts, relax our minds, and breathe in the love of God. That the breath of God’s soul may come in and touch you. Be still. Be at peace, and may God bless each one. I am your brother in Christ, Yogananda.
