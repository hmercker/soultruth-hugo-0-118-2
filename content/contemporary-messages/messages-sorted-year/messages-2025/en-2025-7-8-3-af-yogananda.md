Yogananda received by Al Fike

God bless you, my friends. I am Yogananda. Dear one (Tina), you are a follower of my teachings. You are eager for more. I taught what I knew while I was on Earth, and I shared what I could with those who would listen. Indeed, these sharings have been put in books for all to read and to be inspired by.

Now, I am in a new place. I am not a teacher anymore, but a student. For there are those much higher than myself who are able to show me the way toward true enlightenment and true understanding of the universe. I have grown to understand how truly important love is. It is the glue of the universe. It is what makes life possible. When you tap into the highest Love of all, that of God, you have found a Truth that is not only of the highest calibre but it shall set you free, free from the burdens of your own heavy emotions, errors of understanding, free from that which causes you pain. When you practise the Yoga of Love, this Divine Love, then you have reached the pinnacle of spiritual progression.

There is nothing higher than this, dear daughter. There is nothing more potent, nothing more healing, nothing more true than the way of Love expressed in the purity of the soul transformed by this gift. Indeed, I admired Jesus in my life on Earth, but I did not truly understand his message until I entered into the spirit world on my way to actually meeting this exalted soul. He told me the simple Truth. What he said, I had even uttered myself in words, but the experience with my beloved brother, in knowing God's Love, brought such breadth and depth to my understanding of this Truth that I realised what I knew before was merely a shadow of what that Truth was.

Now, I know the power of this Love, and I have truly been changed from it and with it. I want others to know of this, because it can save you much time and effort, dear daughter. It can change the world in such a way that all of these spiritual laws and teachings that are so rampant in the world, that are so easily shared and yet not truly understood, can be sidestepped. When one is in harmony, in sync and desires to receive this great gift of Love, it awakens the soul, the fire of Love igniting the soul's capacities and gifts so that the perception of truth is laid bare within the consciousness of the individual.

This perception is not of the mind, the material mind. It is not received and experienced through the exercise of yogic postures and kriyas and all of these things which have been taught in the Eastern philosophies. What I speak of is very different indeed. I wish for humanity to know that it is in simple prayer, desire and longing of the soul that truth comes in all its myriad forms and expressions. It comes because the soul, ignited by this gift, has the capacity to receive, to experience and to understand deeply the truths of God's creation, this universe that we all inhabit.

Be a part of this universe, the universe of God. Be humble, dear daughter. Be true to your own soulâ€™s desires. They are deeper than your mind. They stretch out to God. God answers as the Touch of the Spirit of Love changes you, awakens you, purifies you and brings you joy that you could never conceive of, but is truly a part of this beautiful gift. I know this joy. I live this joy and it is a joy that I never had on Earth. Yet, you could. All of you can. If you seek out elixir, the Essence of God's Soul, it will give you all that you require, all that you need to truly walk a path of light, fulfilment, a destiny with God, at-onement.

May you be blessed, my beloved friends. I am happy to be here to speak, to share, to love you and to pray with you. I am Yogananda. My love is with each one of you, precious children of truth, creations of God. We are truly brothers and sisters upon the path of life. Blessings to you. Love, abundant, endless Love is available to each of you for the asking. Seek it out and it shall be given freely. God bless you all.
