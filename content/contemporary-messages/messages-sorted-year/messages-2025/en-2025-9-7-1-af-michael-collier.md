# Choose to be Part of a More Harmonious World

September 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Harrow Retreat, Harrow, UK

Michael Collier received by Al Fike

The tide of change is coming, beloveds. It will sweep over you and everybody in this world. It is not the tide of fear. It is not the tide of destruction, but it is the tide that will touch everyone's heart and everyone's soul. For those who cannot be touched, those who refuse the offerings of God, they are the ones who will suffer. They are the ones who are not able and will not allow the compassion and Love of God to touch them.

You, my beloveds, you must step forward and say, “I am willing. I am eager for change, for all that I am and all around me to change, not because of the destructive conditions of man, but because God wishes for a more harmonious world.” Are you willing to change? Are you willing to follow the promptings of your heart? Are you willing to let go of those things so attached, so much of the material that is not necessary? Are you willing to simplify and be in greater harmony with all that which is of love?

These are the questions we wish to leave you with, beloved souls. These are the things that are most important to entertain in your minds and in your souls. Can I change? Am I willing to walk a different road, to be in greater harmony with those things that are of God and less attached to those things that are of man? God will provide all that you need to make those changes. What worries you? Will He provide all that you desire? The answer to that question is no, because much of what you desire is not truly what you need. What you need is an open heart. What you need is to be generous, kind and loving. What you need are those simple things to sustain you, but all the other things, all that is so much in the minds of men, have no relevancy to what is coming and what shall truly be peace on Earth.

Be eager for this, my beloved friends. Be true to your souls’ knowings, desires and wisdom. You will find yourself walking a road that will be different and will reject much of what you have been attached to in the past. Detachment is key. Love is key. Wisdom and spirituality, more keys upon this path of true change, to reconcile yourself with that which is in harmony, to reconcile yourself with your inner harmony. These things are important.

We are with you. We have shown you that we are with you. God has shown you that He loves you. Now it is time for you to acknowledge what you have been given in these few days together and to find your way upon a path that is of love and light, that there is no conflict, no stress and strain, but merely harmony and peace. All is given, my friends, to those who are willing and open and desire this. God is there for everyone. We are there for all of you.

May you be blessed, beloved souls. My name is Michael Collier. I once lived in London, worked in London and now I am a Celestial Angel who has your concerns and your well-being in my heart and my concerns. I will stick with you, my friends, and help you. You may ask for me by name and I will come and I will help you to see, to understand, to accept and to integrate what has been given and what shall be given in the future. God bless you all. Keep you in His Love. I am a friend of yours and I love you, each one of you. God bless you.
