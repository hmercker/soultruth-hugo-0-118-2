# Affirms Michael Collier’s Message

January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Charles Darwin received by Al Fike

I merely affirm [what our friend has said](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2025/en-2025-1-23-3-af-michael-collier/). I concur with his description about evolution. I have learned much while I have been in the Spirit World and continue with my studies. I have changed my perspective. There is much in the world of man and the creation of God that still is to be discovered, understanding that might come to you and be delivered to you.

Understand that you may discover for yourself the truth that might come in your experience. Do not set the boundaries of truth upon the words of men, but allow yourself to know the truth that is beyond words. Release the boundaries of the mind to that which is open and receptive and a gift from God.

The soul knows so much more and is capable of so much more. But, first, you must free yourself from these restrictions and allow yourself to sink deep into that place of understanding and truth. There, the truth lies. There, it shines bright. There, it defies description.

God bless you, beautiful friends. I seek this Love as you do and continue on the road of my progression as you do. I am Charles Darwin. May the blessings of Love be with you.
