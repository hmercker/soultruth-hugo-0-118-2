# Discerning Guidance in Making Every Day Decisions

Matthew received by Al Fike

I am Matthew and I wish to speak about guidance.

If you allow me to use the allegory of an individual walking along a rather meagre path in the dark as God lights the way in a distance beyond your footsteps, but not far beyond that. When you seek guidance, you are seeking guidance for the moment, for you are not well aware of what is ahead of you and you must trust and have faith in the guidance that is given, allowing your journey to unfold as God designs it. You also have free will and can stray from the path if you are not careful. You must be vigilant, prayerful and have faith. Provided you are within the alignment of God's Will, you shall not stray from the path. As long as you continue to walk forward, you will take the path that God wishes for you to take.

This allegory is a simple explanation, but because of the human condition, your own biases, desires and insecurities, there is great temptation to venture off the path or to remain still. Therefore, your progress is halted. We encourage you to pray and continue to receive the Father's Love, to continue to walk forward and to continue to listen to your soul's promptings and guidance. For this is where we speak. This is where God speaks and assists you upon the journey. No matter how logical and elegant might be your thinking, is it a part of God's Will and God's plan? It is important that, when you have thoughts and ideas, to bring them in prayer to ask for guidance and confirmation.

If you do not do so and act upon whatever idea you might have, it is probable that you will fail and therefore you will have to revert back to the main path that God has designated. Many individuals, many dear souls who are well-intentioned, do this almost daily. They venture out beyond the prescribed route because they are curious, wilful or desire something of their life that they see they may obtain by taking the circuitous route. Indeed, we who guide you and are with you must be patient, allowing you to test your capacities to act and to be in the world. God's path is a straight and narrow one, but your path is almost always meandering, coming back to the straight and narrow and then venturing off again in some circuitous way.

It is important that you understand your own psychology, your own motivation and your own desires. For if you do not understand these things and act in the moment, then you are more likely to venture off the path. I say be vigilant and be prayerful. God will not steer you wrong or take you on circuitous routes that are not in alignment with God's Will. This cannot be so, for this contradicts His Laws, but you as humans, as mortals, are constantly contradicting God's Laws, testing the waters, willing yourself here and there. You wonder why there are difficulties in life. Indeed, you create the conditions where you are tested and where you might fail.

In this world of yours that is so centered on mindful, thoughtful conditions, it is easy for you to get caught up in the mind and to think erroneously that this is your guidance. Indeed, some guidance might be a part of your thought processes, but clarity and directness in this guidance is often not obtained until there is a trial and error of this meandering. Yet, as you continue to grow in the Father's Love your soul expands, your perceptions are honed, your intuition a part of your everyday experience, your faith strong, then the path becomes less circuitous and more in alignment with God's Will. As you practise and express your own experience in life and utilise the laws that you have been taught, given and, to some degree, understand, then there will come greater harmony and fewer obstructions to what is God's Will and plan for you.

Every soul on this planet is challenged in this way. God emanates His plan to every soul. God's plan is perfect and God's plan in the longer expression of it will come about. Yet, there are many, many souls who are unaware, who are willful and who desire something very different from what God wishes for His children. God wishes only harmony, peace, joy, truth and love, all the goodness of God's great Soul and all the potential goodness of your soul. Unfortunately, humanity has gone down a road that contradicts this, so there is much suffering, there is much confusion and there is much darkness.

You have chosen otherwise. You have chosen to trust God, to have faith in God and have faith in His plan for you and for the world. Thus you are the leaders and examples of what every soul must do in order to find harmony, peace, truth and love. Yet, even you test the waters, my friends. Even you continue to exert your will to a degree. You find it hard to be humble, to listen, to allow to the guidance that comes to be acted upon and to be trusted. Yet, you are learning. As you continue to discover the pitfalls of your own willfulness, you come back to the center point, that straight path of God's design and you find your way. Each time you correct yourself, you strengthen your capacity to listen to God. You hone the ability to be humble and perceptive and allowing what is meant to be to be.

It is an arduous journey, I know. The easy part is prayer to receive and so you receive readily and desire intensely. It is in the daily actions of your life where the challenges remain and the difficulties come into play in your life. My beloved and beautiful friends, God is patient, generous and loving, as are we. We cannot stop you from stumbling and hurting yourself, but we are there to help you pick yourself up, to help inspire and guide you back toward the center point. We will always be there, beloved souls, children of God, for we love you so. God loves you. Love is the key to finding harmony, to listening to your soul and to enacting your guidance.

With this great Love within you, the wisdom comes and the ability to understand and be guided comes more readily. You develop a discernment to know that which is your will and that which is God's Will. As you progress incrementally upon the path, so these things become predominant and more readily understood. You begin to trust and rely upon the guidance that is given. Only you know how far you are upon that path of truly understanding and living in harmony with God's Will. Each of you is given great opportunities, beautiful opportunities, to come to that place of understanding deep within you, bringing it to your consciousness and living in a way that is meant for you, that individual path that God designates for you.

Be patient and loving toward yourself and be patient regarding the efforts of learning, discovering and absorbing the truth of the soul. These things will come to each of you. They are flowing to you now and with every breath. Continue to be open, continue to consider, continue to be humble and continue to be kind to yourself and to your brothers and sisters. In this way, the openings for God's blessings upon you are wide and deep. You will continue to grow steadily and resolutely upon the path.

God bless you, my beloved and beautiful friends. I am Matthew. I am happy to give this talk, this teaching to you today. We will continue to express truth to you, to help guide you and to love and protect you. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.
