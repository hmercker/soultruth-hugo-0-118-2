# Encourages a Review of Judas Messages to Strengthen Knowledge of Higher Truths

February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Judas received by Al Fike

I come. I am Judas. Yes, there is a [book of my channellings](https://new-birth.net/conversations-with-judas-of-kerioth/book-judas-of-kerioth/), sharings that you might also want to read. There is much in there that will help you along the path and help you to understand things. These reviews, these readings, are important. They help put the mind at rest and help you to recognise the road marks upon the way, the journey towards truth.

I urge you to read these things as well and to consider the importance of knowledge. You indeed feed your souls, and you do so regularly. I encourage you to feed your mind with higher thoughts and higher truths. Each time you read these passages of truth, you will glean more knowledge and a different perspective. You will add to the great body of knowledge that exists within you.

Continue in your pursuits, beloved souls. I know it may seem contradictory as we talk about the mind as an obstruction, but when you instruct the mind in the way of truth, it becomes your ally upon the world.

God bless you. I am Judas. I too have a great interest in your development and your journey toward truth. God bless you all in the great Truth that comes with the Father's Love and the great truth that is recognised when you take a truth, a volume, a passage and, within you, you recognise the validity, and the power of the words shared in a book. God bless you, beloved souls. I will be close. Many will be close, helping you along the way. God bless you.
