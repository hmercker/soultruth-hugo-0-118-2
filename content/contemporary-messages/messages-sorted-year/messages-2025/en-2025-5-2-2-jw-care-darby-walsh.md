# Getting past your wounds - Part 2

May 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

I  come again, but I shall be brief.  I simply wish to clarify [what I said earlier](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2025/en-2025-5-2-1-jw-care-darby-walsh/). I am Care.

When speaking about those who find it easier to rest in their hearts, to allow God to open their souls, there are of course, both sexes, but I was pointing out the predominance. More importantly, I wish to say this. When one cannot release from the mind and allow the soul to ascend, it is because of deep hurt, somewhere in the past, that has sometimes lingered through a lifetime. That hurt has propelled that soul to create a protective barrier, which on the one hand can be said to be beneficial. Still, on the other it prevents the necessary healing, the necessary expiation, and the forgiveness of others as well as forgiving oneself, to open the heart. The way to help these hurt people is not only to be kind, but to encourage them to pray, for if they can feel the love of God, they can also feel safe, and it is important for all of Godâ€™s children, whatever age, to feel the safety and the peace of His love.

When one is hurt, physically, it is often necessary to take medication. You do this when you have an aching head, for instance, you have a cut or a wound, or perhaps an operation that requires you to receive medication that will ease the pain, possibly numb it. This is a very good thing. However, I wish to say, when you have physical pain, it is one thing. When you have spiritual pain locked into your heart, it is not a good idea to overmedicate, to numb that pain so that you never deal with it. If you allow yourself to be in prayer, to feel the pain and ask God to heal you as you expiate and you let go and you forgive, you are lifted up. You are no longer behind the barrier that you have created, but you have ascended above it; you have progressed in your soul. So do not be afraid to deal with your, if you wish to call them demons, or shortcomings, or your failures. For we all have failed, and recognition that you are a child of God and loved beyond measure is one step in moving past the pain and the stagnation that your hurt has caused.

As you feel the love of God, just be still, be calm, feel the great peace beyond your mind, and step into grace without fear. You will be glad that you did. And for those of you who are not dealing with these issues, it would be a great thing to help another (who is) with compassion and empathy, knowing that they are to be blessed.

I thank you for allowing me to come again, and I shall step back because there are others who wish to speak. May God bless you. I love you all. I am your sister in Christ. I am Care.
