Orion received by Al Fike

Friends, I am Orion. There are many ways in which God upholds you. The Creator of the universe knows you intimately. You are loved beyond any possibility of recognising and truly understanding how much you are loved. Your prayers are important. Your desires are crucial. Your efforts to be a light in the world are necessary.

You understand that the world needs you. You understand that we use any and all opportunities and instrumentalities that are open to us, to your angel friends and to the bright spirits. Yes, there are some who are truly pure and beautiful channels in your world. Many are not known to you at this time, but you will come to know them. The Law of Attraction will ensure that these connections are made, that God brings these blessed children together, forming a great body of service, of enacting the plan, the work that is part of God’s Will and design.

My hope is that you are joyed by this understanding, that indeed the number of souls you have met thus far are meagre in comparison to what will come. As you open yourself further to the Will of God, as your soul opens and develops faculties, gifts and abilities within, so your journey will be clarified and powerful in its impetus for you to move forward, connect and be a part of this great and beautiful plan that God has to salvage humanity from the depths of darkness and bring it to the light and joy of harmony.

Every day brings you closer to what you might be and what is within you, percolating away, developing and growing. You will come to realise soon enough all the variations, all the beauty, all the hues and colours of your beloved soul expressed and continuing upon this journey eternal toward great light, beautiful light, light of many colours, light of many possibilities and abilities, to heal and uplift, teach, garner wisdom, express love and to know God.

These are the things that, on my planet, we put as the highest of priorities. These are the things we hope that you, too, will focus upon and eagerly seek to develop. For as your eagerness is expressed in desire, prayer and application, so one gift after another, one faculty after another, one thought and desire after another will reveal itself, until you are part of such a great momentum of change, reclamation and transformation that you will scarcely know yourselves, for the change will be that great and, at times, that sudden.

You will be a light, pure and beautiful, the characteristics of your unique soul laid out for your conscious self to recognise, love, adopt and embrace, so that you are truly of soul, of light, expressed in all the ways that can be expressed. You are given many opportunities, blessings and support to carry you upon that path. We are together today, once again. I am pleased to be here with my cohorts to help you, to assist you, to help foster and bring about the development of your true self, the soul that is God's glimmer in the universe, unique, full of potential, full of power to bring greater harmony to God’s universe, to your universe and to all around you. Be that light, beloved souls. Listen to your soul as it continues to listen and know the great Soul of God.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. My love for you is great. Oh, how much it pleases me to see you grow, to see that light intensify, to see the colours and expressions of that soul of yours, so loved by God and, indeed, loved by me. God bless you, my friends. Orion loves you dearly.
