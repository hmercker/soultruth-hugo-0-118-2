Mary received by Elisabeth Mack

I too bring blessings from our Father to you, children who walk this path of light. You are all nurtured along this path. Open yourselves and you will receive even greater and more blessings to assist you in your endeavours and in your journey toward our Father.

Remember, dear children, ask that you may receive all that you need and all the Love that will bring you closer to our Father, our Creator.

May God bless you. I am Mary, the mother, and I love you dearly. God bless you.
