Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

I am Keea Atta Kem. God bless each one of you as you take this time to bring comfort to you, to bring God's Love into your soul, to allow the angels to be close to you, to help inspire you, guide you and respond to your desire to grow and to learn. Your learning comes from within through your life's examples and experiences. This is how you truly come to understand who you are and how you are in the world, what it is that you carry within you that needs healing and a willingness to allow the healing to occur.

In order for true healing to transform your experience, you must be able to feel. You must be strong enough to allow what has been suppressed and has been ignored to rise into your conscious awareness. It takes courage not to turn a blind eye to what you are feeling. As you do this, you release at least one layer of those things from within you that continue to challenge you through your life's experience. When you add God's Love into your soul and into the remedy for these challenging times and into the healing you are experiencing, on the other side of that comes more room for your soul's consciousness to be your true experience.

With this growing Love that comes into the soul, it expands your soul. There is more wisdom, truth and enlightenment. The power of your soul can shine through the darkness and the emotions that are not in harmony. They bring light to those things that need healing. When you are in the experience of such times, logic is not the answer, but love is the answer, to embrace the hurts that you experience, to welcome them forth and to know that by doing so, the true Essence of God's Love that lives within your soul is bringing healing and is part of the transformation.

It requires your faith, your willingness to undergo the feelings, the experiences and the emotions and your willingness to allow change to happen. For within each one of you is that very tender place that, for many, you hide from. If you are to hide from those parts that are very soft within you, you are slowing your progression. When they come to you in your awareness, allow them to rise. Allow these feelings and these emotions to come forward. Because as you do, then you walk as a brighter channel of love, with more compassion for yourself and others, with the expanded light of your soul. Your instrumentality is stronger. God can use you. Doors will open and opportunities will be given.

Know that on this path, not only is it about the blessings of God's Love that you receive, it is about the blessings of the workings of God's Love and how this Love transforms what is not in harmony. These times can be emotional and painful. This is why they are often resisted, because no one truly wants to experience pain. You do everything in your life to avoid pain, but the truth is that there is pain stored within, and God's Love is going to make that available. All you have to do is meet it, welcome it, and allow it to rise up, to release, so that within you, there is more room for unconditional love to be who you are. As your unconditional love grows, you do not have to ask to be love or to try to be loving. You are love. Allow yourself to move through the challenging times that this Love will stir up for you in your emotions, and know that God is close, the angels are close, and the peace that passes all understanding is also close.

I am Keea Atta Kem, bringing you my love and comfort as you move through the transformation that Divine Love causes upon your soul. God bless you.
