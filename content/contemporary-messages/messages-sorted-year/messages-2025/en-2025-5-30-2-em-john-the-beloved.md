John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John the Beloved. I encourage you, each and every one, to drink up this Love, this Love that awakens you and enlivens you, this Love that is available for the asking.

Open widely, dear children, for the Father pours this Love upon you at this time and your souls? This is what your souls are thirsting for: eternal growth, eternal Love, eternal progression. Stay tall, strong and drink this Love. As Keea has said, allow it. Open to it and grow. We raise you higher now and bless you in many ways. More joy is yours as well as Love. More commitment to this Love is yours. More blessings will unfold as you continue to open.

May you open widely and deeply and allow God's Breath into your souls. I am your brother, John the Beloved. We all love you deeply. May God bless you and may you walk this path with your brothers and sisters forever.
