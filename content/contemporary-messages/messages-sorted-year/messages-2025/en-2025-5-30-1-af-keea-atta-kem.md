Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

God whispers into the ear of your soul, His sweet Voice uplifting you in light. I am Keea Atta Kem. I come to pray with you as well, to be in that harmony of God's grace, the Light of His Love shining upon us. God has gathered us together into that great Hall of Light, so that we may commune as one body, as one group seeking the highest blessing of the Heavenly Father.

Be that light expressed within you and through you, putting aside all inhibitions and restrictions. Be love in all that you do and all that you are. Be blessed, for God is here to bless you and you are here to receive that blessing. Do not overcome and shy away from this, but be with God in the fullness of your heart, in the eagerness of your mind and the desires of your soul. Be with God and God will bless you in abundance, ushering you along the road that will bring at-onement, that will bring the healing and the grace that will ensure that you are liberated from the harshness of the human condition and given deep insight with your soul's awakening, as God continues to whisper within your ear that you are loved and that with His Love, He wishes to give you all the Truth, all the guidance and all the understanding that you can embrace and bring deep within you.

My beloveds, you are deeply loved and you shall be deeply loved for all eternity. Appreciate those drops of Love that you already have, for they will last for eternity. Acknowledge that you are a child of God and that relationship will be with you for all eternity. See that you are transforming, that the changes that are happening within you will reflect the transformed you that shall live for all eternity. My beloveds, open wide and seek with longing the great gift of God's Love. We shall be in the light together, the peace passes all understanding, the beauty and the grace that is God's Touch upon each one of us. It is given freely and abundantly. It is for you to allow and to be open to all that God has to give to you.

May His grace befall you, my beloveds. May the angels crowd around you and all the spirits who are seeking, who need attentions that will bring peace, that will bring comfort and love. These things are yours, my beloveds, as God uses you as that focal point of light to bring blessings to many. God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you so. God bless you. God bless you.
