Orion received by Al Fike

The world is indeed in turmoil. There is great need out there in the world, my friends. I am Orion. I come to be with you once again. Indeed, there is conflict everywhere. There is conflict within the minds of all on this planet, conflict that comes from judgement, conflict that comes from pain, conflict that is expressed in rage, all sorts of conflict, which means a lack of harmony.

How might you counteract these conditions? Certainly, you must resolve conflict within yourself. Find peace. Find harmony. This is done, as we have instructed and you have known for many years, through opening your soul to the great Creator of all, the one who brings peace, the one who resolves disharmony. Each of you must make that personal effort to be in harmony within yourself, to express peace in your life, to be true to the power of love and to bring all that you require so that you are at peace and you are an instrument, a channel of love.

If you cannot resolve these things within yourself, how might you be an instrument to resolve conflict in the world? If you do not have the wisdom that lies in the soul, the lack of judgement replaced by acceptance that lies within the soul, the love that lies within the soul, how can you express this in the world? God will infuse you with these conditions, but if these conditions that are contrary to love within you exist, then it will be a stilted and distorted expression. As we have encouraged, purity is needed. A true desire to be free of these human conditions is needed.

My friends, the responsibility rests with you, each one of you, to be vigilant in your thoughts, to be vigilant in your feelings and to be vigilant with God, truly seeking God out, truly seeking harmony within you and truly being in alignment with the Truth of God's Love. When these things are accomplished, then your instrumentality will be tremendous, powerful and will reach many. Each of you are here because this is your desire, to be God's instruments in the world, to develop your gifts and abilities that will demonstrate the truth and be an expression of the truth. My beloved friends, you are each endowed with great potential and many gifts. The Love within you, within your soul, grows. You are allowing this Love to enter into your consciousness. I urge you to open the doors, that the floodgates may pour forth in love, so that you are truly a light. You are truly an instrument of love to comfort and uphold your brothers and sisters.

Yes, conflict is everywhere, but when you are free of it and you are detached from judgement of it in the world, then you become a pure and beautiful instrument for love. When you engage in judgement and fear regarding the conditions in your world, then you add to these conditions. You are a part of it and your contributions do not make for harmony. Your consciousness is not in harmony when you take seriously the information that is sent to you over the wires, so much so that you fear for yourself, for your loved ones and for the world.

Fear is a dark condition. Fear does not bring hope, nor does it bring light. Yet, faith, my friends, faith in God, faith in God's ability and desire to bring resolution and harmony to the world, now that is a gesture of love and light. I encourage you to be in that condition and that frame of mind and frame of soul, so that you may be inspired and guided to be an instrument for God, to help others, to be a light and to be a beacon of light and peace. This will help the world. The choice is yours, my friends, to continue reinforcing and feeding those human conditions that are still within you, that are so much a part of habit of thought and deed, or to make a stand and say, *“no more. I will not be a part of this. I will stand alone if I must, but I will not be a part of this.”*

If you are able to be that strong and that vigilant with your own expression and light, then indeed, God can use you in many ways. These ways may not be overt, spoken and challenging to others. It may be merely to bring peace, to generate, to be an instrument of peace, or it may be otherwise. If you do not let yourself stand in the way of God's Will through you, then you will be surprised as to the outcomes, as to what may be accomplished, as to what may be said and as to whom you may befriend, individuals who you would never think of befriending because of past judgements. Rather, when you are a friend of the world, then there is no judgement. There is only love. When you are a friend, even to the most reviled, there is a chance that they may be blessed, that they may change, that they may know a different way in the world.

These are your challenges. As always, I come to inspire and often challenge you, but these challenges need to be addressed. For the impediments, barriers and flaws within you that preclude love must be removed, dissipated and healed. This must come on the heels of love and it will, my friends. It will. Love yourself, love one another and love your Creator. In this, all will fall into harmony and be peaceful.

God bless you, beloved students of truth. I am Orion. I love you so. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
