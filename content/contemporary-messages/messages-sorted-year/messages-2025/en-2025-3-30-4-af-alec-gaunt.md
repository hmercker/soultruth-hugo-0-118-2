# His Dream for FUSC Has Come True

March 30<sup>th</sup>, 2025

First United Spiritual Church, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Alec Gaunt received by Al Fike

I once walked the halls of this church. I am so very pleased to see that this is full of eager souls, seeking souls, beautiful souls. This is a dream come true. Indeed, I will, and many others will, come and uphold you all, guide you and help you in any way that we can, bringing healing and grace and bringing joy to your heart. We are all here. We are all blessed by the Hand of God.

God bless you, my friends, and keep you in light. We will be with you in your daily life if you wish for this to be so. We will come to help, protect and inspire. God bless you, my friends. I am Alec and I love you.
