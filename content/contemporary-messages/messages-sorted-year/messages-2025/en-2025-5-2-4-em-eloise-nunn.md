# I Give You My Daughter

May 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Eloise Nunn received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Eloise. I have enjoyed being part of this group this week. I have particularly enjoyed helping my daughter in her progression. Worry not. I will not be around, as I was asked to come for a specific purpose which has concluded.

But to see you all interacting as human beings with such love, care, joy and even frivolity, it was a pleasure to know that it is possible to live an Earth life in such a way. As my daughter has hinted, it was not my way when I was on Earth. I will keep watching as you all continue to live your lives expressing the Love that God has given to each one of you, to your own particular and special souls.

I gift you my daughter. Bless you all in the Father's Love and may you walk in peace. I am Eloise.
