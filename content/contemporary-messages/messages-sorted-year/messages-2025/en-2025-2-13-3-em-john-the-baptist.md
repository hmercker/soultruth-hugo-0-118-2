John the Baptist received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am John the Baptist. Your blessings are pouring down upon you. As we speak, the Father is answering your prayers, your desires and your longings. He knows what each of you truly needs and what each of you truly desires. He blesses you in accordance with those desires that are in harmony with His Will for you at this time. As you knock on that door, as you ask the Father, as you truly desire what God has to give to you, which will bring you closer, in greater harmony, in greater love and in greater peace, so you shall receive it.

These physical manifestations may also be a result. But as you know, the Father's Love for each of you is beyond measure and yet in harmony. For this is the truth of the world, that it is to be a harmonious place for all of His children to enter into and to develop their souls in accordance with their choice. But Love will exist in abundance upon this planet in the souls of humankind.

Know that this is a truth and a fact. It will happen, for it is God's Will. Know this to be true and pray to be in alignment with this truth that you may receive the greatest benefit possible. You are being uplifted and your choice is to be closer to God. Your will confirms your choice. As a result, we are bringing you closer, that you may feel the Love, that you may feel the flow of the Love and the peace that it brings. Allow yourselves this treasure of Love.
