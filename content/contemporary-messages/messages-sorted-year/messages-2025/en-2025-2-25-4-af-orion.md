# Conditions Required for Manifestation

February 25<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Orion received by Al Fike

May your souls awaken more fully, my beloved brothers and sisters, that this great Love of God, this Essence within the universe that is available to each one of you, may flow in more abundance. May your souls open more completely and be transformed deeply by this gift of Love. I am Orion.

You pray for the manifestation of our friend and brother Jesus in your world. How many would take notice? How many would be affected by this? Certainly, there would be a number, a much greater number than those of you who are dedicated to the Divine Love Truth at this time. Yet, because of the ways of your world, this manifestation would be discredited and would be disbelieved. A great wave of darkness and negativity would cover over the miracle and the light that this would produce, because this is the true condition of your world.

Thus, the manifestation that you pray for is not possible at this time, nor would it be productive. The world must change. Attitudes must change. Desires must change. The mindset of so many must change from that of being acquiescent, asleep and disinterested to that of yearning, longing and openness. Did this not happen for each one of you at some point in your life? That the door was opened, not because you felt safe or comfortable or in a state of pleasurable acquiescence. No, it was because you had within you a burning desire that often resulted from pain and dysfunction in your life. This desire grew out of a reaction to the environment in which you lived and experienced.

For this to happen to the majority of individuals on your planet, there needs to be a condition that is severe and challenging. When this condition arises, when the severity intensifies, when many are uncomfortable and are awakened from their slumbers, then these manifestations will have great meaning and great portents on what may come in your world. Until that time, many will discard and not give credibility to such manifestations.

There is much trickery in your world. Things are not as they seem. Information shared is not often true. Conditions are manipulated. Minds are brought to ideas and perspectives that are a result of manipulation and a result of the impingement of various paradigms of thought upon the minds of humanity. You continue to develop collectively this reality, this idea of what reality is, this experience of reality that is merely the manifestations of stimulus, response and the mindâ€™s involvement and acceptance of this stimulation.

It is a very mixed-up world, one that cannot see truth clearly and one that is vulnerable to many lies and many conditions of misinformation. What will clear these conditions, beloved souls? What will stir the souls of individuals to such a point that there will be a stirring of the mind, so that as this agitation moves upward into the consciousness of many, so it will ignite questions, a sense of agitation and dissatisfaction about life? As your material plane continues to react to the conditions that humanity is forcing upon it, so the response of humanity to these reactions will be that of disbelief, agitation, anger and frustration.

Many will be very uncomfortable indeed, for the world will not provide for them what they are used to receiving. The world will not acquiesce to the desires of men and bring forth all that they wish to receive without any consideration for balance, harmony, love, or light. The world has been created to engender light and to promote light and further progress. Humanity is contrary to this principle. Yet, this is the principle that God has created for the world and for the universe. Thus, your resistance, your incapacity, and I speak in terms of humanity, continues to cause great friction and great reaction from the planet herself.

You will see these reactions continuing to manifest. They will intensify as time goes on. They will intensify to the point where humanity cannot continue to close their eyes and sleep rather than become awakened to the reality of their condition and their material life, for the material life will be a great challenge to all of you. Only those who have deep faith, who are prepared spiritually, will be able to cope and understand what is happening.

We give you snippets of information. We give you, week by week, more guidance, help and more teaching, so you might understand what is truly happening in your world. We are always there to support you, beloved souls. I do not mean to cause fear and anxiety amongst you. This is not necessary, but the mind certainly ruminates on the possibilities of a world that will react and become contrary to your material desires and needs. Yet, with faith, with the desire to be in harmony with God's Laws of Love and Creation, you will be able to readily overcome these conditions. You will find yourself in a place of peace and harmony, but you will also realise that you must give up certain patterns of behaviour and desires that demand so much of the Earth.

You are used to such a rich and almost over-expression of material pleasure and receiving much that is not in harmony with a balanced life, a life in harmony with God. Each of you knows what I mean when I say this. Your patterns and your desires are each different from another. Yet, you know within your soul that there are certain behaviours and certain activities that you promote within your life that are not in harmony with your well-being and with your heightened spiritual awakening.

You are human and so we are patient. We love you, even though we see such obvious contrariness to the laws that have been taught. Yet, indeed, we continue to be by your side, nurturing and loving, as are many. God continues to bless you and uplift you, to bring you His Love. The effects of that gift will bring within you a sense of what is right, what is in harmony, what is of God and what is not. These things roll around within your consciousness. You continue to mull these things over. You make changes as you go.

As the world changes, you are required to change with it. Otherwise, the peace and harmony that I speak of will not be yours. Rather, you will join the masses in deep discontentment, anger and disillusionment. Many will blame God for this. Yet, they are unwilling to see their own part played to bring about what is to come, the changes that are necessary in order to bring peace and harmony to the world. If you are willing to embrace truth, harmony and love, you will see for yourself what it is that must change in your life and what it is that is not in harmony with God. We will help you to hold that awareness. We will help you to act in wisdom and in loving response to that awareness, so that you may change swiftly and harmoniously.

There is much for you to do, beloved and beautiful friends. There is much needed. There is much required of you if you are to be a leader, a true light in the world. The challenges continue. The way toward greater light is shown. The blessings of God flow abundantly. You, my beloved friends, have the responsibility of choice each and every day, each and every moment, each and every thought and each and every action. I urge you to choose wisely, to choose in love and to be in harmony with all that God has created. If that means being out of step with your brothers and sisters in the world, then so be it.

Where would you rather be, in step with God or in step with humanity? You understand the difference. You see it clearly. I know your choice is for light, for you have consistently chosen this. I urge you to continue to survey your life, your thoughts and your actions, so that they may come into closer harmony and alignment with God. This is the way to joy, to harmony and to peace. It was always thus. It is thus throughout the universe. It is for you to discover the truth and to live it.

We love you dearly and we are with you. I am Orion. I love you and I am with you. God bless you. God bless you, my beloved friends, and keep you in the light. God bless you.
