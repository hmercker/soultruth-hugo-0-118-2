Aliyah received by Maureen Cardoso

To my dear friends on Earth, I come to you from the Celestial Heavens where God's Love reigns supreme and this Love that you open to at this moment flows into your soul, nourishing, sustaining, awakening and blessing your soul with Divine Love.

My name is Aliyah. As I have said, I come from the Celestial Heavens. I am new to many of you, but I do wish to send a very special greeting to my charge. Upon hearing this message, she will know who she is. I want to tell her that I am very close to her, bringing my love and my influence as she continues to progress in her soul on her path of awakening. I send her my love and my comfort. I am honoured to have her as my charge, a very special soul whose desire grows deep to receive this great blessing. I send you my greetings and my love.

I wish to speak about the promise of God's Love, of Divine Love, the promise that it brings truth, the promise that it transforms the soul, the promise of humility, of faith and love, along with the many attributes that come into a soul through its transformation. These attributes become the very essence of the soul. As the soul is transformed in this way, it is easily able to be an expression of the Divine. You are all on a unique journey. Those who long to receive this great blessing through their own free will of asking shall always be given the inflowing of this Love. As you grow in your capacity to long for, yearn and desire for this Love, this growth comes because this Love is transforming the soul. It is not something that you do through your intellect. It is something that you do through your emotion of love and through the desire and longing within your soul to receive.

While you are growing in this ability to be in the state of longing for a duration that is extensive, there is much that happens within the soul. The stirrings that occur within the soul as it expands in light and in truth begins to cause an effect upon those aspects of your emotions, your beliefs and patterns that are not in alignment with this Love. When the awakening of your emotions that are unloving rise in you, it can feel quite uncomfortable. But there is an importance in being able to allow yourself to remain steady within this transformation, because what is on the other side of the release of the unloving emotion comes the availability of a loving emotion.

Then, within your soul, the existence, the substance is now Love. Love expresses itself in numerous ways, whether that be through the attribute of patience, compassion or joy. You will then be able to experience yourself as these qualities, because your substance, the essence of your soul, is now changed. The Substance of Divine Love expresses itself in these ways of change through you.

You may feel, when you come into your prayerful time, when you ask God for this Love and then you remain still and open and receptive for its inflowing, at the time you may think that there is not much happening. But I am here to tell you that through the promise of Love, the workings that are underway in your soul are profound. You are moving from a created soul through the image of God's Love. Having received this Divine Love, the very Substance of God, your soul is being transformed into the Divine Substance.

Be patient with the journey. This journey, at times, is very painful because what rises in you are your emotions that are filled with pain, grief, sorrow, anger, resentment and jealousy, all of these conditions that have become a part of your character. It is important to be able to feel these qualities and not to hide away from them, because if you are to choose to hide from them, you prevent this Love from fully working upon the transformation of your soul. When you experience these emotions, say thank you to God, because inside of the workings of this Love is the release of those things that you truly desire to have transformed in you. You must be willing to allow them to rise, to feel them and for God's Love to fully eradicate these emotions, because underneath them comes the emotion of joy, of love and of peace, a soul that is sincere and authentic, truly loving, fully accepting, humble and truthful, who is an expression of the Divine Love.

We are always guiding you to meet these ends of sorrow through the transformation of Love, so that you can truly experience the joy, the essence of your soul in a joyful state. There is true happiness that is experienced because of this transformation. You are all somewhere along the journey, moving through the process of receiving the Love, the Love having workings upon your soul, the expiation of conditions that are unloving and the transformation into the condition of love, unconditional love.

This, my dear friends, is the promise of Divine Love. It will take you on a journey, not always easy, but where the end result is one that will make you aware that it is so worth every revisitation of the unloving experiences and condition that lies within you. While you open your soul and you feel into yourself, into the very centre of yourself, release your desires, your longings and your desire to receive this blessing of God's Love into your soul. Allow God to respond to you in the only way that God is capable of. That is through Love, compassion, peace, serenity, joy and so much more that is all in alignment and in harmony with Love, the Love of God, our Creator, always giving, always responding and always with a promise, a promise of Love that fills you and transforms you into unconditional, Divine Love.

God bless you, my friends. I am Aliyah. God bless you.
