Online Circle of Light, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Allow the grace of God to enfold you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to pray with you, to be with you in this time with God. For my desire and my joy is in this relationship with our Heavenly Father. All that I am, all that I have been and all that I will be is a reflection of my love for God and God’s love for me.

It can be and will be for you, my beloveds, that as you acknowledge God’s Love for you, and as you respond with love for Him, you will find that joy mounts within your soul, a true desire to be at one with your Creator. As you ask for the great gift of His Love, so the joy expands within you and the Love is the great gift that is present and shall remain so for all eternity. Each time you ask, each drop that is given will remain with you, beloved souls, forever. I urge you to seek this gift of Love, to allow God’s blessing to enter into your soul, drop by drop, that you are not only uplifted but will be changed irrevocably by this gift. The changes that will come you cannot truly know or understand until they are with you, until you have expressed fully the gifts of your soul, ignited by this Love.

Each of you has much within that is still to be discovered, still to be opened and expressed. It is God’s Love that will ignite the awakening within you. In this awakening, the gift shall flow along with the joy, the perceptions, the experience, the revelations and the journey to at-onement. My beloveds, you are loved by God. It is for you to discover how very much you are loved by God. It is for you to experience the bliss and the joy of this Love, to open yourself and your soul and to allow that consciousness of soul to rise up into your daily life and become truly a part of it. In this way, you become a light, a beacon and a channel of love for God. Be with God now, my beloveds, and know that He touches you deeply and changes you forever.

God bless you. I am your brother and your friend. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom. I love you dearly. Open to this inflowing. Yearn and crave for it and it shall be given in abundance. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you in His Love.
