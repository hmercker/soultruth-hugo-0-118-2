# Describes His Long Journey Through the Spirit Spheres

September 18<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Louis XIV received by Al Fike

Je suis Louis XIV. This dear soul saw me and recognised me earlier today. I am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom.

Believe me, the entrance to that place was hard won for me. As you well know, I lived a very decadent life on Earth, very indulgent. The narcissism, the insatiable desires of the flesh, the thought that I was indeed next to God, were all great impediments to my progress. Coming to the spirit world brought me down a notch or two, as you would say. I was not exalted, nor did I live in the beautiful rooms and palaces that I designated for myself. For a time, I walked these halls as an earthbound spirit, not wanting to leave and not wanting to realise my true state.

In time, I realised I had to leave and had to reconcile my true self with my condition that I resided within. In time, I prayed and sought, clawed my way from the darkness into light. Much help was given. Many who knew me tried to assist me, but indeed I found that the only one who could truly help was myself. Myself seeking God, myself uplifting and seeking out the truth of my soul. This became an extended journey of discovery, of growth and of awakening. Indeed, I found the truth of the soul, the truth pertaining to the soul's relationship with God. I became very repentant indeed, much regret, much pain, much remorse, much release in order to be purified and to find my way toward light.

For I was not in light, but darkness. I was not happy, but extremely sad, until I found the way out of my condition. If someone like myself, the epitome of darkness and depravity, could find their way to light, joy and happiness, then your journey, my beloved friends, my fellow countrymen, is an easy one compared to mine. For each of you, from what I can see, has a beautiful soul and the journey you must take is not so great, not so difficult. I urge you, my friends, to continue to seek out your soul, to seek the way forward in soul progression and transformation. For when you seek out God in this way, you do yourself a great favour, a great service. For you will not inhabit this body for long and you will inhabit the spirit world for a very long time. I urge you to prepare yourself for what is to come and to live a good life, a life that is in harmony with truth, the generosity of spirit and soul, to assist your brothers and sisters, the capacity to love, not just in the way that you were born into, but the way in which you may know love and express love through God’s Love.

This is, in my perspective, the only journey to take, the one worth travelling, the one worth applying yourself to, the one that is truly a blessing and a benefit. When you do so, you will sidestep many of the pitfalls that I made and many others make. For most who go into the spirit world do not experience the exalted condition of love, light and joy. Rather, their place of habitation is often mediocre. Their understanding of the spirit world and the truth is almost non-existent. They find themselves in a place that is neither light nor dark, neither good nor bad, but extremely mediocre. Do you really want to land up in a place like that? Or do you want to know a place that is of joy and light, a celebration of life? It is for you to find, my beloved friends. Find it on the easy road rather than the difficult one. For laid out before you is the easy path, if you but take it and embrace it. Then you will find yourself awakening to the truth, a soul exalted in truth and changing and transforming in truth.

This is what is offered to you, beautiful, beautiful seekers of light and truth. This is what will be given each and every day, provided the desires of your soul seek this out. Seek for the light and I will do what I can to help you. There are many arrayed around you who will do what they can to help you. God does not allow you to be an island unto yourself, but will give you all the support, all the love, all the assistance that you can accept and embrace. It is for you to walk that road toward greater life, my beloved friends. You are far wiser than I ever was on Earth. I encourage you in that wisdom,  desire and strength to seek out light, to be a light, to seek out the Love of God and to know it truly and to live it fully.

God bless you, my friends. I am Louis XIV. I was once your king, became a pauper of spirit and once again became exalted in truth and light. Not to lead with power, but to lead with light, truth and humility. God bless you and keep you in this beautiful light that surrounds you at this moment. My love is with you. I am here to assist you. Blessings to all of you.
