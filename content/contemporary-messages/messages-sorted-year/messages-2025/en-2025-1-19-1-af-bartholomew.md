# Invites Us Into At-Onement with God

January 19<sup>th</sup>, 2025

St Michael, Barbados

Bartholomew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Bartholomew. Welcome, intrepid travellers upon this Path of Love toward at-onement with God. I am a part of you, your brethren, your brother. I come to assure you that I will make every effort possible to support you upon your travels, to be with you in your prayers and to help awaken you upon the journey.

For this is not a journey that is taken easily, and you are not alone. Though the world may deny that you are indeed loved by God without restriction and edicts, though the world may turn your head toward things material, though the world may not love you, you are within that loving embrace, that place of grace. You will find yourself strengthened and blessed mightily in Love. As you grow in this blessing, as you become stronger in this light, the naysayers, the conditions of darkness and all that is against you will seem as nothing, as you, in your faith, in your heart and soul, will know the truth and follow the way of God.

As you do so, blessings will flow, and the mercy of God shall reign upon you in all its glory and wonderment. The Love of God shall be yours and sustain you, not just in your life on this Earth, but forever. Seek its glories, my friends. Do not hold back the yearnings of your soul. Know that in those yearnings lies the key to life everlasting. In your prayers to receive this great gift of Love, will come the transformation that you so desire, that your soul is willing to undergo all that God must give to you, awaken within you and transform you so that you are free from conditions not of love and not of God.

This is where you must stand, my friends. Do not tolerate, do not entertain, do not be slack in your thinking and doing. When you come to the human condition, and accept it and embrace it, you do a disservice to yourself and to God. Only those who are strong and steadfast, who seek diligently and with the trueness of the soul that can withstand these distractions, that which draws you in and that which is so very common in your world. These thoughts, these deeds, these fears, this error that is not truly of the soul shall not abide within you, my friends, when you are truly a part of God and God is a part of you.

Stand firm and be truthful. If there is weakness in your heart and a lack of desire reaching for God, this is not your soul speaking. It is the mind, turned and twisted by life on this world. Do not allow this to be your world and your life. Be true to the needs and desires of your soul and you will enter a world that is filled with joy, truth and love. Be strong, my friends, and willing. Do not entertain the darkness in times when you are weak or drawn away from God but stand firm and be a light in the world.

For how else will this world change? How else will your brothers and sisters find their way out of darkness if there are not those who carry the lantern of truth and decree within themselves and their lives that they shall hold firm in light? The truth that they know shall be the truth that they live. The truth that burns within the heart of man, redeemed by love, shall be the truth that shall save humanity from the darkness.

It was given long ago. Now it is time to reignite that truth and show those who are seekers what it is that they truly seek for. God shall demonstrate through you the blessing of Love, the power of Love and the way toward Love. You carry this within you, and you must stand firm in what you truly know and what you truly are, not allowing the doubts and recesses of your mind to send you beyond that road of love, distracted and lost from the true Light of God's Touch.

Be true to what God has given you. God will always remain faithful and true to you. No matter what might happen in your life and in this world, God will stand beside you in His Love. God shall send the angels forth to protect you and guide you. God will be true to His commitment to uphold you, to love you and to bring you to light always, if you are true to your dedication to God.

Be firm, my beloved friends. Know that the Light of God is here with you and the Light of God abides within you. You shall be the example, emanating a channel of love, a beautiful light, a true servant of God. God will reward you for these efforts and you will know that reward, for your heart will know the joy of Love, the wisdom of Love and the wonderment of Love. It is yours for the taking, for God gives freely and God shall give you all that you desire that is in harmony with His Truth of Love.

May you be blessed, my friends. I am Bartholomew and I come to stand firm with you in the truth. I shall not leave you, nor will I forsake my commitment. You may ask of me, ask for my help. Ask when you pray that I might pray with you. Ask away, my friends, for I have an ear to your desires, your prayers and your needs. I shall do my utmost to stand firm at your side.

God bless you, my friends. God bless you, deeply, profoundly, powerfully and beautifully in Love.
