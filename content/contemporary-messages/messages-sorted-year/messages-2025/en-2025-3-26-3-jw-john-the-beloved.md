# Engagement of the Soul

John the Beloved received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am John. Yes, I am the one known as the beloved and this is speculated as the most beloved by Jesus. You must understand that the love that Jesus had was the love of God and was equal for each and every soul that he encountered. If you wish to ascribe the true meaning of my relationship with him as beloved it is because my soul was able to perceive much of the true meaning of the Gospel that the master preached. This brought the love of God into my soul and gave me a true spiritual alignment with brother Jesus. This alignment comes from the true longings in one’s heart, in one’s soul for the love of God.

There are many who seek to understand the truths of Divine Love with their minds and often go down the rabbit hole of endless speculations. When one reads between the lines of what is received and one finds the yearnings of the soul to be at one with its Creator, then one truly begins spiritual life. For those who wish to speculate whether this or that is true, whether the ambiguity is not, and all of the endless analysis they will find it leads to nothing more than disappointment for it is not the engagement of the soul but rather the mind. Spiritual life is not as we have said many, many times, an intellectual journey but the journey of the heart.

May each one open to the great love of our heavenly Father Who loves us so with eternal everlasting love.

God bless you.

I am John.
