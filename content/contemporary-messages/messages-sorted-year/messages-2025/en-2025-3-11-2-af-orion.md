# The Strength of Your Prayers Determines the Power of the Outcome

Orion received by Al Fike

My friends, it is Orion. The more intense your prayer, the more powerful the result. The more sincere you are in your thoughts and desires; the clearer is the passageway to God. When you allow your thoughts and conditions to be clouded by anxieties, fears and judgments, conditions that are of the human condition, then the results of your prayers are inhibited by these unfortunate things. This is a basic teaching, I know, but one that bears reminding over and over again, for each day tempts you into the human condition. Each day brings you your challenges.

It is important to remind you, my beloved friends, to stave off those conditions and thoughts that are not in harmony with love, to not indulge yourself in such things because there is a sort of emotional gratification that comes with this. Rather, put them aside. Put them aside and be with God in the purity, power and beauty of your highest selves, your soul speaking to God with the clarity and desire that is truly within you. When you do this, those worries and cares melt away. Those conditions are not truly of you, but when you continue to reinforce them with your mind and feelings, then they become empowered and, in so doing, they empower more, until you are in a vicious cycle that takes you from God.

God is always with you. His Love is always available to you. The power of prayer is well known to you. I urge you, beloved souls, to continue to seek out the highest blessings, the greatest light, the most beautiful of angels, stellar friends, bright spirits and friends on Earth. All these things work together to bring you upliftment, peace, joy and greater inflowings of Love.

You must master these truths to be a teacher, a healer and a light. If you are stuck within these loops of depression, anxiety, judgment, anger, negative thoughts, then you are like everyone else in the world. Indeed, in order to have compassion for others, it is important that you have these experiences, and you recognise the patterns. Yet, surely, you recognise these things that are so familiar and so powerful within you. You need not indulge yourself anymore in these experiences. Rather, choose light. Choose harmony. Choose love. Choose joy. In this way, all that God wishes to utilise within you and through you will be accomplished and accomplished in a powerful way. Many will benefit from this.

You are getting closer to that place of purity. You are getting stronger so that you may choose to be in that place. You are learning, day by day, challenge by challenge, test by test, to choose the light, to choose that which is of light and to choose God over the conditions of man. Yes, my beloved friends, you are on the threshold of revelations and shifts of consciousness, of souls awakening and of true expression of love that is high, powerful and beautiful in all its glory.

My friends, come closer, step by step, prayer by prayer. The increase of your faith, the power of your will, the humility of your soul combining to bring you into alignment with God, these things come as you shift your consciousness toward the light. Each time you pray, as you do now, that shift takes place. You make another step forward, and another and another until it is a swift pace toward God, a joyful run, a beautiful abandonment of all those old and tattered pieces of yourself, joining, in fresh garb, your true selves, your true way and the way of truth.

May you be blessed, my beloved friends, in that journey, that passageway toward God. We are with you. We know this passageway well. We are with you as you struggle toward it with leaded feet. Yet, there is no need for struggle. You will find your way. You will let go of the impediments. You will know the joy that comes with freedom, awakening, harmony and love.

You are blessed, my friends, to have such good friends in spirit. You are blessed to know the truth and to be in that harmony of truth. This is what God wants for you. This is what God wants for every soul in the universe. God has made the passageway clear for each one of you and we will for those who wish to aspire toward this highest way of being, this truest way of prayer and this beautiful expression of the soul.

It is all for you. For Godâ€™s Love for you is immense. Embrace God. Embrace yourself in love and be at peace, my beloved friends, for you are in the light. It comes and envelops you, a gift for you and for humanity. God bless you, my friends. I am Orion and I love you so. God bless you.
