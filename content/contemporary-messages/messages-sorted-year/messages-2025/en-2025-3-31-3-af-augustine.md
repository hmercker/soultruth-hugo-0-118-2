Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. You have each been chosen to play your role, to contribute your gifts and to be a channel of love toward the center that is your organisation and the people involved.

Many seek validation. Many seek acknowledgement. Many seek love. They come to you, this simple and beautiful organisation, to be a center of light and truth, to guide others and to show them the way. You take on this responsibility seriously and with dedication. You are provided with the resources in order to do so. You are blessed, doubly blessed, in order to bolster and to uplift each of you in your role and in your continued progression.

Many eyes are upon you, dear and beloved children. Many eyes look to you as an example, as a stabilising influence and as one who knows. Indeed, you must step carefully, put aside judgements and, in many respects, be fearless, to be clear about your position, your opinions, your mindful conceits and to walk with your soul guiding you and your soul being guided by God. There is no other way to do this, beloved souls. Indeed, there are times when you feel strained, frustrated and have opinions that are contrary, for you are human.

Yet, the goal is to bring the Truth of the Father's Love to the world. Each of you are committed to that goal. Each of you does your part to bring this forward into the world. That is what is most important and what is necessary. The rest is a part of the human condition and the mind that continues to wrestle with various dilemmas. There will come a time when most, if not all, of these dilemmas will disappear. You will have the clarity that you seek and the liberation that comes with that clarity. Those picadillos of human behaviour, those criticisms and those worries, will no longer be relevant. You will know that freedom of joy, of joy of having love flow continuously and without interruptions by worldly concerns.

Beloved students of truth, beloved souls seeking God, beloved servants of God's Will, you will continue to be upheld, embraced, nurtured and guided. You will see the truth of the matter, whatever that matter is, more fully and resolutely. Remember that your brothers and sisters are struggling with truth in their own way as you are. Do not judge them but realise that each has their path to trod and their issues to resolve.

Together, as you are unified in love, you offer the strength, wisdom, perceptions and loving balm to comfort, uphold and to teach. Each time you set forth into the world as God's instruments, you are learning and you are growing. You will see what is in harmony. You will see that those small issues that are not in harmony are not truly important. You must focus on what is important, what is required and necessary and to be clear and focus upon these things without being distracted by the minutiae of human concerns and behaviour.

Be God's instruments, my beloved and beautiful students. You are indeed a light, each one in your own way. You will be guided. You will be taken care of. The material issues are the least of your focus. The spiritual is what is required. Be true to these things and all else will fall into place. All issues will be resolved. All mistakes will be corrected. All judgements will be meaningless and irrelevant.

God bless you, beloved souls. May you continue to receive the Father's Love and great abundance. This key that brings all solutions, all healing and all upliftment, it is yours for the asking. It is yours at any moment. Receive and you will find the benefits, the healings and the dissolution of darkness. All is for you, beloved souls. We are here for you. God is here for you and shall be for all eternity as you walk this Path of Love.

God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. My love for you is great as you continue to plough the field, to bring the truth, plant the crop of truth and to be God's faithful servants in a world that truly does not understand what that means. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
