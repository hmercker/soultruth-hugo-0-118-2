# God Intends for a Centre of Light to be Established Here

September 10<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Augustine received by Al Fike

May the blessings of the Father be yours, my beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine.

God intends that a Centre of Light be established in this country, that those who are doing the foundational work toward this may come to understand their purpose and destiny to be a beautiful channel of light and truth, not only for their country but for this area of the planet. We have come to help establish the beginnings of this intention. This is Godâ€™s Will, that there is a place, a portal, a Centre of Light here, for it is in a place that is filled with blessings, possibilities and light.

The density of the human condition is not so great here. The intentions that people have toward one another are more of light than they are of darkness. There is a sort of innocence here in this country, this culture. It is a propitious scenario to create a Centre of Light. May you all come to see this as we continue with our circle here, this Circle of Light, that each may find their way to understanding and for those who are supportive to help these beautiful souls have clarity and to be inspired toward this great goal. All are being blessed and guided. We will continue as we have, in our efforts, ministrations of the angels, the blessings of God.

God bless you, my beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. My love is with you. God bless you.
