Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear ones, it is I, Care.

Your commitment to sanctuary is something very dear to my heart. For my angels had told me Divine Love would get 40 acres, and my beloved and I, we looked for these places, not having ten cents in our pockets but having hope and faith. It is important to remember that there is your time and there is God’s time. Even brother Moses, who envisioned the land for his people, did not live in it. But he saw something that would occur in God’s time, and what he saw was real.

You have many here willing to help you, and so I say, when you have guidance on how to create places of worship, sanctuary, refuge, take that step, and as I’d always say to my beloved, if it feels right, if you feel the love, continue in that direction, and if not, turn around. All efforts done in the love of God are worthy.

Your aspirations to come together in community to create sustainable places are encouraged. We also have discussed this on this end of the celestial telephone line, and I can tell you, there is a band of us supporting your efforts. So, call on us when you are in doubt or wondering as to whether you should move forward, and we shall respond.

There is much power and clarity when one moves in Divine Love. There is a certainty that comes with being in grace in God’s time and in the flow of His will, where we live. When you come together in prayerful aspirations to receive the Father’s love and guidance, we come. We are delighted to come, and we wish for you safety, sanctuary, and sustainability, all wrapped in the embrace of God’s love. So, take a step forward in whatever way you can. We are behind you. With all the love in our souls and the joy of our being. May God bless you and guide you. I am your sister in the love of God, in Christ, and your friend always on this path.

I am Care.
