Bartholomew received by Jimbeau Walsh

Beautiful and beloved souls, I am your brother and friend, Nathaniel, but you know me as Bartholomew.

I come into this circle drawn by your light, and I wish to touch lightly on a subject well known to some here but not at all to others and especially those beyond this circle on Earth. In the mortal life, time has a significant importance, measure of time, days, years, and deadlines. One often sets goals to have accomplished something within a timeframe. One may fall ill and wish for that time to pass. For, if nothing else, change is the great determiner of events. So, one often will set a time to accomplish a task, maybe a resolution or as you say a bucket list of things one wishes to accomplish or fulfill while still in mortal life. And so, you tend to view life in spirit in much the same way and of course, this makes a great deal of sense, for it is your frame of reference.

Those souls in darkness in the spirit world, often believe that they deserve to be there and that their suffering may be eternal.  For some, it is very difficult to accept that they could progress, but eventually, they do, brought up by another's service. They are brought into the light, brought through all their sins and, attachments, negativities, and they find themselves coming into higher realms, although in the Earth planes, where many do not even recognize that they have passed into spirit but are eventually welcomed and there is some degree of light. When those souls familiarize themselves with conditions in the lower, or let’s say the second sphere as James Padgett received, at some point, they wish for more light, and as they accept their surroundings and are visited by spirits from the higher spheres.  Their desire to progress propels them to do the things necessary for such progress, and thus we have those in the third where there is a great deal of light, and it is a place where people learn how to live in spirit and discover what they might wish to pursue or study or create.

So, the third sphere is really the first paradise in the spirit world. But that sphere is still somewhat earthbound, and thus, when there is a longing to progress and the service of one allows them to do so, they find themself in what we’ll call the fourth sphere where the earth attachments are eventually let go, and there is much purification. And yet, in all the spheres, I might add, including the celestial realms, the love of those on Earth persists. But in the fourth, thoughts of ever going back permanently are released. And in the fifth, what is learned in the third is activated and so you’ll find many spirits with Divine Love, with a high degree of human love, doing things that they have chosen to do, and it is all service in one way or another. Many great artists, creators, in all fields, and many spirits stay in this fifth realm for a good deal of time because it is so rewarding, so filled with light, and they are able to do all the things that their hearts desire. And remember, there’s no time. No one is rushing. What propels one from this stage is the deep desire of the soul.

Those who are more intellectually suited but purified enter the sixth sphere or realm, and those who are on the path of Divine Love spend some time there but generally progress to the seventh sphere. This could be considered as the Celestial heaven’s gate, the doorway to the celestial realms. And, as you may know, those who may be purified souls, but have no desire to receive the love of God, they stay in this beautiful, purified, full-of-light sixth sphere and cannot progress higher without the love. The seventh sphere is the ultimate purification and transformation from the mortal to the divine and when that occurs, there is entrance into the celestial realms. Of this realm, it is quite difficult to describe, beyond saying it is the destiny of the soul that wishes to be at one with its Creator, and the beauty there is beyond compare.

I didn’t wish to go into a deep analysis but give a general overview for those who will hear or read this message. I hope it is helpful, and I thank my brother here, whom I have not spoken through before for taking this message. He was certainly surprised to hear from me, and I thank you all and wish to tell you how loved you are, how beautiful you are, and how much light emanates from your beautiful circle. So, persist in your prayer, and every dream your soul could have will come true in the love of God. I am your brother and friend, an apostle of the Master and a celestial angel. I am Nathaniel Bartholomew, and I love you. God bless you.
