Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

God bless you, my dear brothers and sisters. As you open your souls to the warmth of God's Love, you draw us near, and we join you in your prayers. With each one who is here praying now together, your room is filled with the presence of the angels, for there are many angels who desire to help you and have flooded into your room, bringing their love and condition, with a concert of joy by their presence. They uplift you so that you may be still within your mind, open and receptive within your heart to the great inflowing of God's Love into your soul.

Rest in this deeply. Allow this Love to fill you, to feel the inflowing in your physical body and how it is filling up with the grace of God. Allow this Love to wash away your fears. Let this Love build you up in love, erasing self-judgement and criticism so that you may hear the blessings of Love, the inspirations of truth, the wisdom of your soul from God's Soul and the inspirations of thought from your angel friends. There is no higher gift that you can receive in the universe. Within this Love exists harmony. As you receive this Love within your soul, the very Substance of God, you are changed, eventually becoming harmonious, in harmony with God's laws and love, releasing the human condition that keeps you away from experiencing your true nature.

This Love, dear ones, freely given, flows to you constantly. Be sure to take the time throughout your day to receive this blessing. As you do, you will find your ability to move through your daily activities with a more elevated demeanour because you are being nourished within your soul, body, and mind. You are embodying your transformation. Allow this precious gift to be what you constantly yearn for, always open and receptive to an inflowing. Walk in the light and the grace of this Love. Allow it to inform every footfall, every gesture and every thought, for this is where true strength comes from, the strength of a soul gifted God's Love, growing, developing and maturing in truth. Through this blessing, your demeanour is transformed, and your experience grows in Love. You become the embodiment of Love Divine, which makes you an extraordinary example for God to demonstrate through. For as your soul grows in this Love and emanates from you, Love is effortlessly moving through you because it is who you are. It is your essence.

As you know, according to your desires for such blessings comes God's response. Attune yourself with your sincere desires and let this be your mark of success: a life lived in the transformation of God's Love. This is how you become a channel of love without effort. Your effort needs to be in your desires, aligning yourself with what is within your soul and allowing your mind to step with the beat and the rhythm of its soul, engaged in love, engaged with God's Essence, walking in light, revealing its presence, the Essence of Love.

Bring this to the forefront of your life. Have not a day pass where you do not allow this to occur for you and bring yourself, your mind and your body into the fold of your soul, opening itself to receive this blessing. Observe the workings of this gift upon you, a soul alit with Love, emanating its light and attributes. A remarkable opportunity has been given to you. You choose to receive this blessing. We are with you. The angels stand beside you, behind you and in front of you, surrounding you with love and protection, elevating you so that you may awaken to the desires of your soul, its yearning and its longing to be loved, to love and to be a demonstration of harmony and light.

I am Lotus Blossom, so happy to be with you and share with you some words of truth and inspiration as you journey along, soul awakening and a blessing for God to work through. God bless you.
