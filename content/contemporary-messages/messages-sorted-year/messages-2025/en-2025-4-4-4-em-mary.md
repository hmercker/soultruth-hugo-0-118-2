# Earth Is Blessed with Many New Creations of the Father

Mary received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Mary. I come with blessings for each of you. You know your Father, who blesses you all the time, always in so many ways and looks down upon you with the greatest Love. He brings this Earth into greater harmony, simply clearing those parts that need not be here.

Yet, there are many creations of the Father that do belong upon this Earth. As spring comes, many new beings come with it, many new plants spring forth. You will notice there is a new energy that comes with them. This the Father has infused into this Earth. You will feel the difference as spring comes deeper and deeper into being. As you spend time outside, walking upon the Earth, praying as you walk, you will be able to feel the energy that flows from the ground. You may discern a difference, for the Father has been healing this Earth from the inside out.

You will see many changes. If you are discerning, the Love that has been infused in your soul, if you are discerning with that Love, you will feel the healing that has transpired. Watch the birds, smell the air, open every part of you to your environments and you too will receive material healings as a result. This is the blessing that the Father has given to His children who live upon this Earth, one of many blessings where in truth this Earth provides healings for His children in many, many ways.

You begin the journey to discover these ways, as you continue to walk in Love, to be open, to pray and allow your soul to show you all that there is that is here for your benefit. Know when you see everything that the Father has provided, know His great Love for you and all of His children upon this Earth. It begins now, my dear, true children of God. It begins now. We are all with you as you travel during this season of growth.

I love you so much. My love is with you. May God bless you more and more with each prayer, each moment and each breath. God bless you. I am Mary, the mother of Jesus, who comes with a gift of healing for each of you.
