Direct Voice Group, Celebrity Summit

Orion received by Al Fike

The son's prayer is very relevant indeed. I am Orion. We continue to assist you in your preparations. We continue to encourage you upon the road of soul awakening, putting aside the diatribes and prospects of the mind and engaging in soul perception and soul communication. For this is where the key to the opening of this door of Direct Voice is found. It is the soul awakening, the soul expressing, the soul of consciousness coming to the fore where the possibility of these gifts is manifest.

Each of you may have your own mental conclusions and ideas as to what this will mean and what this is. Yet, I say to you, my friends, do you truly understand from that place of soul where the understanding is not so much a stringing together of words and ideas, but is a knowing? It is a feeling. It is a perception that defies logic, but is the result of the soul's faculties awakened with this great gift of Divine Love. When you are at that place, when you see, feel and experience the truth from that place, then you have arrived at the place that is required.

Some of you feel far off from that place while others do not. Yet, within the soul, the soul that is longing to be at-one with God, that knowing exists and it is ready to come to the fore. The question is, are you ready to accept this way of being, this way of seeing and knowing? I know within your minds you are very eager for this to be so. Yet, there is reluctance and resistance, because within you is a knowing and understanding that these perceptions and this state of being and living comes at a great price. The way you relate to the world will change dramatically and, of course, the way the world relates to you will change. You will come to that place of feeling as if you were a stranger in a strange land.

This is not an easy place to live within or to adjust to. Yet, integration  is required. The understanding must come to each of you if you are to step forward in this role as a manifester of light, of your angel friends and even of us from other worlds. This, as you can well imagine, will change the perceptions of many, will be revelatory and will shake many to their roots. Yet, this is required, this great shift of consciousness, this great shift of understanding and of focus in one's life. For without that shift, humanity continues on its present course, which, as we have said many times, is very destructive indeed.

I ask you, my beloved brothers and sisters, children of truth, how much truth can you take? How much truth are you willing to absorb, to integrate and to live by? I know that the world is filled with many concepts of truth, many explanations, details upon details of what humanity believes is truth. Yet, this is not the truth that I speak of. The truth of the soul is different. Although it encompasses many details, those details are held, contained within the body of soul awareness that is connected with the great Oversoul, which is God.

The access to truth is there and readily available when this level of consciousness is obtained. It does not hold information and detail like the mind does. It is not like a biological computer that holds information. It is a resonance and a way of communicating, transmitting and receiving that is inherent within the soul. Each of you, and every soul, including mine, has this capacity. The discovery of new ways of understanding truth is needed. As you move along this path of discovery, you must learn to integrate these truths and express them in the material world. This can be very challenging indeed, but it must be accomplished. For we do not develop these things for you alone, for your own gratification and your own satisfaction. It is for the world. You must see this from that perspective, that you are developing, growing and finding your way, not only for yourself, but for the world, to be that individual who brings truth, who shows and demonstrates truth in ways that are baffling to many, but undeniable.

This is the goal. It has its great challenges, of which we have talked about. Yet, it has its great rewards, which you know and feel within your soul is true. Each of you carries this gift and potential. Each has the possibility of expressing it in the ways which are planned and the ways which are in alignment with God's plan. Indeed, you must truly be in alignment with God to hear God's guidance, blessings and Will for you, to know this Will as second nature and to express it in all its eloquent details and expressions that are possible. There is much yet to learn and to do, but you get closer, my friends, with each day. Some of you will be surprised how close you are and how that expression may come without your inkling of it coming. Rather, it comes on the heels of the breath of God, the blessings of God upon you and in situations and conditions that help facilitate this expression.

Continue to travel with me, your angel friends and bright spirits into greater light. Continue to be with God in greater depth, faith and knowing. God has so much to give to each of you. God will give all His love in abundance and all the truth in abundance. All that can be had by those of you on Earth will be given provided you are an open receptacle and channel.

May God bless you on this journey, my beloved friends, and keep you close to the fountainhead of His Love. You will find your way. You will see when you have accomplished this gift by looking back through the passage of time and your experience in life, your experience together here, the meaning of it, the purpose of it. Great insight will come to you, my friends, and great realisation of the journey that you have taken and shall continue to take. God bless you, beloved souls of light. I am Orion and I love you so. I am with you always as you continue to journey down the road of progression and of soul awakening. I am with you, as are many. May we continue as we are meant to. God bless you, beloved friends. Orion loves you.
