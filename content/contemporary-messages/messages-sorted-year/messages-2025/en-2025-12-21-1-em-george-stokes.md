# Soul Celebration of Christmas

December 21<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Beams of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am George Stokes. I am your brother in Christ. And I come here to celebrate with you this gift of Love that is being bestowed upon you and continues to be bestowed upon you. As you come closer to that day of celebration of when the Father rebestowed His gift, the potential of this gift, to all humankind upon this Earth, as we come closer, those in the Celestial Heavens, those few upon the Earth who understand,  who have received this gift, there is much jubilation in their souls. For they know the truth of this time of celebration. They know because they have the gift within their souls, and they understand the meaning of awakening with this gift of Love from God…understanding, and there are many upon this Earth who have accepted this gift in their souls because, in truth, their souls long for it, but they may not understand that they have received this gift. Nonetheless, their souls are joyous and celebratory of the awakening that is occurring because of this gift, because of the day that this gift was rebestowed. Stay close to your souls with the understanding of the truth of what you call ”Christmas.”

Open your souls and allow the Father to continue to bless you not only on this day of celebration but every day. For this is how you manifest gratitude to the Father for His gift: to ask for it, to long for it, to appreciate it, to acknowledge it. It is, as you know, the greatest gift that one can receive, whether on this day of Christmas or any other day, and since then, as you already know. I wish you all happy holidays, peace and love at this time of your year  and remember this could be every day of your Earth years. May God bless you abundantly. I am George, and my love touches each one of your souls. God bless you all.
