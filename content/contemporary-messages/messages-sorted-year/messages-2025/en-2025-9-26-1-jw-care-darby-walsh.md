# Sanctuaries will flourish if their foundations are built on God's Love

I am here, Care.

I have been following my beloved around on his journeys, so happy for him to be with his Divine Love family and friends. For him to be engaged in prayer with like-minded souls. I am aware that you wish to create sanctuary, physical places of refuge, with a foundation of Divine Love, with sustainability, and with open arms to all. Many of us have been watching over your conversations, and we have been giving you some guidance. As you know, in different cultures in different parts of the world, sanctuaries will be unique. They will all have their own, one might say “flavor,” and yet with the foundation of God’s love, one could easily go to one sanctuary, find themselves in another without much transition involved. For the soul engaged in the love of God is already in a higher state, a more harmonious condition. This is the foundation that is required, more than any particular idea, for all ideas grounded in the love of God will be good. In one place, you will have large accommodations and gardens to go with. In others, it may be in a house or, even, a place of worship that is created, or that you have now made your own.

Many, many changes will occur over the years. This work will be a co-creation, and we shall influence your thoughts so that what you build will stay grounded in the love. As you discuss how and where and what you envision, we move in that direction to help you connect with the means to create, to build these places. It is important, it is necessary, but it takes a leap of faith. It takes a willingness to move beyond one’s personal place of comfort and into the community and communion of those like-minded individuals, those who you pray with, and those who you are attracted to in spirit. For though you wish to create that which is material, the purpose is to build on the spiritual foundation in the love of God, that the world may be transformed, that every soul who yearns may have an opportunity to be touched by the Creator’s hand, that their souls may be at one with the great Soul in endless love.

You are close. Have faith. Move forward. Whatever you shall give, whatever you shall give up, will be rewarded tenfold and more. For, as you know, what you do for another is rewarded by your heavenly Father, Who places the glow of His love and gratitude in your heart. Please know that your actions will reverberate far past your lifetimes in ever greater magnitude to those who come after. We are with you. God is blessing you.

Together, we shall be one in community, one in His love. Envision what you will, knowing it makes no difference if it’s this or that or the other, if it is in the love of God. So, have fun, explore, create, and have faith that your vision shall become a reality, that the wishes of your soul to create will be manifest. When you call, I shall come, and we shall bless your days here together, and you should know that your mates are with you in love. May God bless you. I love you.

I am Care.
