# Precious Birds of Earth, Sing Your Songs to God

September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2025

France Retreat, Fontainebleau, France

Confucius received by Al Fike

Little birds, I am Confucius. I come to bring peace, healing and light to you, little birds of Earth. I come in love. I come because you are all in need of refreshment of the spirit, the soul and the mind. I come to bring the Light of Heaven into your midst.

Precious birds, sing your songs to God. Give your praises to your Creator. As you do so in prayer and contemplation, you increase the light around you and you bring the blessings close. Beloved souls, every soul is loved by God equally. That love surpasses anything you can imagine. Anything that you have experienced with God is merely a fraction of what can be, but you must build the conditions and the desire. You must put in the effort and open yourself. That vulnerable and soft place that is the soul must open to your Creator and be touched deeply by God's Hand.

This is not a common thing for mortals, to be so open and receptive, but we come and protect you and surround you in love to make it easier for you to reach that place. That place where you and God are together, that peace that passes all understanding, that joy eternal. May His Love continue to nourish you, to bring you into alignment with His Soul, to show you the way toward greater light through this Love given. The passageway is cleared, the awakenings come and the revelations deeply touch your soul to bring you to that place so dear, so precious and so beautiful.

Blessings to you, my dear, beloved friends, little birds. We shall fly, ascend to heaven in light, joy and love. God bless you and keep you in His Light. I am Confucius and I love you all.
