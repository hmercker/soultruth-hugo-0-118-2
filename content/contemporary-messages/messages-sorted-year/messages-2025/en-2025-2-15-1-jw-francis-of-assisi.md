# Creating Sanctuary

February 15<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Nashville, TN, USA

Francis of Assisi received by Jimbeau Walsh

I wish to speak about creating sanctuary and, most especially, spiritual sanctuary. There have always been movements to create safe, sustainable, peaceful, and protected places where people could live in harmony. If you consider the tradition of temples, ashrams, and monasteries, then you are looking at a creation of places where souls could feel all those things and align themselves with their Creator.

Many times, these beginnings are quite humble, and in my own case, I needed a place to pray, and I would go off alone, particularly to an abandoned place of worship where I began to, stone-by-stone, rebuild it and where I found such soulful and heartfelt connection to God and the angels. Such freedom that my friends, who perhaps had thought I’d gone mad, could now see how delighted I was, how happy I was. These were very humble beginnings, and at first, we had not the support of the church but only assistance from kind-hearted donors who sustained us. Yet as we grew and rebuilt, we began to expand with gardens and times of worship and interaction to some extent with the world, the public at large. Of course, you may be aware of the Poor Brothers that became the Franciscan Order honoring the Poor Claires, both of which still exist today, and Claire and I guide them as best we can.

As you may know, humble beginnings that are based in truth and the deep aspirations of one’s soul; and the vision one has in prayerful guidance can become a reality. You now begin to see individuals offering places and this will be the case in some instances but not all. For, as you have been told, we wish you to establish these sanctuaries, these places of refuge in many places, in many cultures. Though aid will be perhaps diverse in approach, when the foundation is to receive the love of God, to have one’s soul changed from the mortal to the immortal, from the human to the divine angel, that oneness in the love of God supersedes whatever diversity may make you feel separate from one another.

As the Master exhorted his disciples to be at one with the Father as he was in the Father’s love, keep this as your foundation, and all else will be given to you. There are many here who support your efforts. We clearly see the need, and we shall, within the limits of free will, continue to try and influence those who may help you.

Have no worries. Your vision will become a reality, for God is great. With all my love and blessings to all here and for your community around the world, your beautiful light, your pure hearts, and your sincere longings. We pray with you. May the love of God be upon you and bless you each one. I am your brother and friend. I am Francis, once of Assisi, now an inhabitant of the celestial kingdom in the love of God. God bless you.

I am Francis, once of Assisi, now an inhabitant of the Celestial Realms.
