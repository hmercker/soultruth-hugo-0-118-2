# A Great Service Performed in the Circle Today 

August 31<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Online Circle of Light, Chicago, IL, USA

John the Beloved, George Stokes, Mary & Luke received by Elizabeth Mack

**John:** I am here, my beautiful friends. I am John the Beloved. I am pleased to come to speak to you today. I have come to also pray with you and love you, as it is the Father's Will and our pleasure to do so. You are gifted with the Divine Love in your souls. You are few among many upon this Earth. You have brought us here to pray, to uplift you, to join you in this sacred exchange of Love from your souls to God's Soul and from God's Soul to yours. This is truly a blessed event, one that can occur at any time with any number of people, any number of souls.

It is a joy to see this circle of souls being blessed by the Holy Father who watches over us and cares for us. How I wish you could see the light in this circle and how it is expanding beyond the confines of your physical beings, connected, one to the other, beyond time and space, the brightness that you are bringing to the Earth, the influence of God's Love filling this planet. Oh, how I wish you could see, but trust me, I am telling you, it is a great work, if you want to think of it that way, moreover, a service that you are performing for our Heavenly Father, and one done in love, such love.

I am so moved, so moved. I extend blessings to each one here, as do many, many of the Celestial Angels and stellar friends. We are pouring upon you blessings upon blessings for this service that you are performing. Please, do this often. It does not matter who or how many, but come together in prayer, giving your love, giving your love to each other, giving your love to God, joining together in this service of love for God.

God bless you. God bless you in every possible way, as He expands and lights up your souls. God blesses you in every, every possible way. I am your brother, John the Beloved. I am so pleased to participate in this event. Let us continue in our communion with our Heavenly Father.

**George:** I am George Stokes. I address those of you who come wondering if this is the place for you to be. I say to you, you are worthy of being here. You have been attracted to the light in these humans and in these spirits. By that fact, by that Law of Attraction, you are worthy to be here.

Open your souls and receive all that you can possibly receive from the Creator of your souls and of this universe and of all that there is. For it is God's Will that you receive this gift of Divine Love every time you long for it, you ask for it, by yourselves, individually or together. You are worthy, as you are a child of God. Know this. Know this truth.

God bless you. I am George Stokes. I thank you for listening and hearing my message. God bless you.

**Mary:** (I come) with a blessing for each soul here, sent by God to bless each one. In His name, you are each gifted in accordance to the Father's Will and your receptivity. My love is with you also. I am Mary, the mother of Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens.

**Luke:** I come forward. I am Luke. I bring a blessing of healing upon each of you in this circle and those who are attracted to this circle. You may receive this blessing, which will help you to open more to the gifts that God has to give to you. Call upon me when you desire more healings. I will joyfully come and assist you.

God bless you. I too am your brother. I am Luke the Physician.
