Confucius received by Al Fike

Little birds, I am Confucius. I advise you to make good time together, to be spiritual in your thoughts and your interactions together. These times are very precious. You have made great effort to come together in this way. Elevate your thoughts, beloved souls. Seek for the highest for yourself, for one another and for this time that you spend in a day.

For each of you is a light. Each of you is beautiful. Express that light and beauty in all the ways possible, for you are given the opportunity and the possibilities to be that light. All your material needs are attended to. It is for you to be in that spiritual state of harmony and close to God, so that you may avail yourselves of many blessings, for we have much to give to you. God has much to give to you, if you are open and the conditions that you carry are harmonious and the love that you feel is great.

Allow God to open the door for each one of you, for the potential is here for great blessings, revelations and sense of true self, knowing the soul, knowing the soul in its richness, fullness, in its light and its capacity to love. Be that condition of love. Be joyful and true to your soul's longing, for it is within that longing that the connection is made with your Creator. As you do this in a conscious way, then you are feeling intensely and deeply the experiences of your soul in relationship with God. Put aside your mindful things. Put aside your desires that are not of God. Be in that harmony, the fullness and richness of God's blessings upon you all. You will feel, know and be of joyful gratitude for the blessings of God which come to you freely and readily.

Nothing is withheld, beloveds, and much is to be given. Open yourselves. Put aside all conditions that are not of the soul, of love and of the highest, for you are given the opportunity to be away from the earthly conditions, to indulge and feel that which is of the divine. Breathe deep the Love of God and release all conditions that are not of this Love. We will travel upward, ascending into great light and great love. Come with me, little birds. We shall fly heavenward and know the blessings and grace of the Touch of God.

I am Confucius. My love for you is great, dear, precious souls. Dear, precious souls, we are together for a purpose, the purpose of growing in the Father's Love and feeling its effects, knowing its effects within us, through us and every part of us, this gift working and touching us deeply. God bless you, beloveds. Confucius loves you. God bless you in peace. God bless you in Light. God bless you greatly in all things of God.
