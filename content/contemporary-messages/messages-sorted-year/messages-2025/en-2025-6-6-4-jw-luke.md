# May you all be healed in the balm of God’s love

June 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Florida Retreat, Inverness, FL, USA

Luke received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Luke. Be at peace in the love of God.

Allow your concerns to dissipate, and all these protective walls that you have erected to protect your hearts, let them down, let them dissolve in this peace, in this Grace. When you are feeling the wounds that you have harbored, some from childhood, some presently active, it’s not that you need to expect the forgiveness of others to you, but first and foremost, forgive yourselves. And in the benediction of allowing yourselves to move on, you are able to forgive all those who have wounded you, and you begin to realize they are wounded too, just as those who are most fearful are often the most threatening. For if you did not feel threatened, you would not need to arm yourselves or threaten others. So, what then is your protection? The love of God is your shield. The love of God is the sword of light, the only armor you need, my friends. And as the Master spoke earlier, rather than react to the negativity in the world, to all that is out of harmony, that which you are confronted with, that which disturbs your hearts, be in the love of God. You needn’t react, you needn’t have an argument that you cannot win. You needn’t respond intellectually, rationally to the irrational. But you need to love, and in the love of God, there is forgiveness, there is forgetfulness.

There is the exponential progression as you let go of your soul to God. When your mind is busy and you cannot feel peace, simply talk to our Heavenly Father. Whether you talk internally or externally, the Heavenly Father hears your intention. The longings of your souls to be free, to be in grace. The bliss of the Holy Presence.

The sacredness of this circle reaches out in this community as you send out your love. This is the Father’s gift to those wounded souls, those angry hearts. Embrace all, and as we like to remind you, seek first the kingdom, and all else will be given to you. And in your prayer, you will find the peace that is beyond human understanding. Allow yourself to feel this great gift. Open your heart as God will open your soul, and His Holy Spirit will fill you with the love, Love Divine.

Lastly, I say to you that there are many here and they are at one with you in song, in prayer, as we are. May you continue your walk free of the baggage that you have carried for so long. For all you need is this love. All else will be given to you, and it always has. I thank you. I am your brother in Christ, a disciple of the Master, and your celestial friend.

I am Luke, the Physician. May you all be healed in the balm of God’s love.
