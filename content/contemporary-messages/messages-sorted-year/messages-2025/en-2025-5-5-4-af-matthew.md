# Have Compassion for the Lost Souls

May 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Matthew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Matthew. As you have walked around this city (San Francisco) and you have encountered people engaged in life, do you see how they are engaged in the material so readily and so thoroughly? They are engaged with their emotions and their thoughts, their expectations and their judgements. They are all very human, these souls who you encounter, but they know nothing of their souls. If they are fortunate, they will receive a snippet, a brief encounter, something that will engage their souls, but often that is not in prayer. It is in reaction to some external stimulus.

If you extrapolate these conditions, which are all around your world, then you can see why the human condition exists. You can see why so many walk in the blindness and the ignorance of this condition. I urge you to have compassion for your brothers and sisters, especially when they have no idea of what is coming in this world, the changes that will manifest. For in these changes, there will be great grief, chaos, doubt, anger and all conditions of man extrapolated and expressed to a high degree.

You must be in the centredness of your own soul. You must be strong within that soul. You must come to know the expressions, the perceptions, the feelings and the experiences of the soul, for that is what will save humanity, not some mindful solution to external events and dilemmas. This will not save humanity, for humanity lacks the wisdom and perception in a mindful way that could solve even a portion of these problems. For every problem that is solved, another one crops up. No, it is the wisdom of the soul, beloved and beautiful friends. The wisdom of the soul is what you must encounter, nurture and listen to. This wisdom comes from God, as you well know, the wisdom that comes with His Love, the wisdom that comes as your soul responds favourably to the blessing of His Love. With this wisdom and with the perceptions of the soul, you will see solutions, not only for you and your life, but for those around you.

They will come. They will come in a great onrush of love, a great onrush of God's Presence in your life. When you encounter this and when you grab hold of soul consciousness, then life will be easier in many ways. The dilemmas that so many face will not be so in your life. The angst and the emotional turmoil that exists in so many will not exist within you. You will be solidly in connection and relationship with your Creator and with the soul that makes possible this connection. In this, you begin the momentum, a great flow of transformation and truth welling up within you. 

You are contrary to most you meet. Yet, you bring the saving grace. You are the ones who will carry the banner of truth. You are the ones who will teach the way of peace, truth and love. You are the ones who God has blessed, because you have decided to be blessed and to be with God. As you look out upon the sea of humanity, have compassion, for they know not the course of their journey. They know not the purpose of their journey. They know very little and but they feel, think and interact in so many ways. Yet, so much of this is superficial. 

Some have a life filled with meaning. Some indeed are laced with love and with perception of love, but primarily, the motivations of humanity are not of love. They are motivated by fear, by desire, by reaction, by emotion, by many things, but it is not the Love that you know, the Love that you carry. You must bring this Love forward. You must demonstrate and express this Love wherever you go, so that you may be those shining examples for the lost ones, ones that know not that they are lost, but indeed they are. They will find their way, given the opportunity to do so. God relies upon you to help them see, to help them find, to help them embrace this Truth of Love, the magnificence of Love that comes from God.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, with the strength, the perceptions, the faith and the love that you require in order to do this work. This work that is so vast. This work that I know, for some of you, feels overwhelming and confusing. Yet, indeed, God will guide you along the right road. God will give you the perceptions and the understanding that you require in order to fulfil the mandate that He has placed within your soul. You will find your way, beloved souls. You will find your way and help others find theirs. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Matthew and I am with you often. God bless you.
