Sechelt, BC, Canada

Confucius received by Al Fike

I bring love and praise for my friends on Earth. I praise you because you have chosen the highest path, the Path of God's Love. You have walked the road less travelled. You have come to be with God. I am Confucius. I come to you in love and praise for the beautiful souls that you are, for the wondrous gift to humanity that you are. Even though you may not see yourself in this light, you are a testimony of truth for the world.

You have endured the obstacles. You have walked the path consistently with fervent prayer. You have taken the challenge that God has laid before humanity and answered with faith and desire to receive the gift that God wishes to give freely to all. In your answering, in your opening to God, you have become an instrument, a channel of love and of light for the world.

This is the case because you cannot resist that love flowing forth to all you meet. Though you may have conditions of judgments of the mind, your soul is a bright channel, a beautiful conduit of God's blessings for others. I would recommend that you do not obstruct this flow of love, for the world desperately needs your instrumentality, the channel that you provide, that God has created within you through your soul, a beautiful conduit of love and light.

As you grow in this gift, so you will find yourself becoming an agent of light, dispersing darkness and bringing truth to many. As you commit and recommit yourself to God, so God responds with greater blessings, openings of service, openings of joy and openings of light for each of you. Beloved and beautiful, precious and glorious souls of God, reflect your origins, for all has come from God, our Creator. Reflect the highest expression of your being, which is your soul ignited in Love. Be earnest and true to the path that God has laid before you and you will find a glorious journey toward greater light, at-onement with God and greater love and compassion for humanity. This is the highest spiritual quest.

This is the highest blessing, beloveds, for each of you who walk the road of the Divine Love is especially blessed and uplifted because you do God's bidding. You express God's highest blessing and Truth. You will be blessed. You will be guided. All that is good and glorious will be yours for eternity, my beloveds. As you continue to grow in this Love, you will find the eternal path to at-onement with God. As you continue to open yourself to God's guidance and to God's blessings, so you become a formidable instrument of the Divine. You are blessed, my beloveds. I honour you. I praise you for the gift you are to this world, for the gift you are to your loved ones and for the gift you are to humanity.

May God bless you and keep you upon the path of the highest, the Path of Love, so that you may know the freedom and joy, the wonderment and the glory of this wondrous journey, as your soul is transformed and you are redeemed in truth, love and light. God bless you, beloveds. I am Confucius. I come to you because you have drawn the blessings of the angels who surround you at this moment and who are entering into the world in great numbers to bless many because you have opened yourself as an instrument of God and facilitated blessings for many through your prayers and through the connections, that great light woven in a lattice that spreads through the world.

You are a part of this and shall remain God's instruments for however long you may, beyond this world. You are God's instruments, beloveds, and beautiful, beautiful lights. Continue to seek the Love and be the love and God shall bless you fully. Tremendous blessings upon you. God bless you. Confucius loves you dearly, dearly loves you all. I thank you for your choice, for the highest of all blessings. God bless you. God bless you all in Love.
