Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Keea atta Kem. As the flowers bloom and life springs forth from your Earth, may the ardour of your soul be felt and known to you, the desire to be with God, to know His Love, to grow and blossom in His Love. For God wishes for you to have all the glory, the wonderment, the beauty of His Love within you. God wishes for you to seek it with every breath. God desires to bless you with His Love with every breath, that you may seek out the Holy Spirit in all that you do and all that you are.

For when you are fulfilled in this Love, when it accumulates to such a degree that you feel the transformation happening within you, then there is joy. Then there is a shift in perception, purpose, priorities and desires. Within you, much changes because the Love of God becomes the dominant influence within. It opens your soul so that you may truly be awake to all that can be within you, through you and all around you. God offers a way toward peace, truth, joy and love. All these wondrous attributes of God can be yours, dwelling within your heart and soul so that you may know them and you may live them as a true expression of yourself.

There is so much that God wishes to give each of you. There is so much available, given your openness and desires to receive, to know, to acknowledge and to live within these truths. My beloveds, you are given special dispensations from God. God has, indeed, ensured that you have come to know this Truth. God has opened the way and paved the road for you to walk this Divine Path. Indeed, all the efforts made on your behalf are a wonder to behold. All the blessings that are given, all the angels that are present, all the light that is shed upon you, if you could but see this, you would know how loved you are, how much God loves you and makes that effort, that expression of love, to uphold you, to bring you truth, to bring you peace and to awaken your soul. All is given, beloveds. All is given in the flow of His Love, in the ministrations of His angels and all the beautiful, beautiful blessings that are yours, given freely and given with love.

Open yourself to these gifts, the bounty of these blessings, the upliftment of God's Touch upon you. You will be one step closer to at-onement with God, one step closer to being a pure and beautiful channel for His Love and one step closer to be a powerful teacher demonstrating the truth to your brothers and sisters. Be that beautiful soul that you are meant to be. Do not hide your light away, but step forward into the world as a light, as a channel for God, expressing God's Will wherever you go and being His instrument for the benefit of humanity.

May you be blessed, my beloveds, truly, truly blessed, in the Love of God, its power felt within your heart and soul and its peace surrounding you, the joy welling up within you. Oh, the grace of God. it is yours for these moments. Seek it and be embraced by it, truly. I love you, dear ones. I am Keea atta Kem and I love you so. God bless you.
