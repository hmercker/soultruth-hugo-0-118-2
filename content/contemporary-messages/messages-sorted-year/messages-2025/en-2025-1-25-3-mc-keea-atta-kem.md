# Awaken to the Wisdom and Longings of Your Soul

January 25<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Starpoint Retreat, Christ Church, Barbados

Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

Beloved souls, I am Keea Atta Kem. I invite you to allow your mind to relax, your hearts to open and to trust and have faith that, within your soul, there is much that is being received. For as the dear son has indicated, your soul has a mind of its own, a mind that can perceive truth, that contains wisdom, and that is your centre of true compassion and love. While we are asking you to open your souls to be receptive to this great Divine blessing, we understand that at this moment in time, your minds are very active because you have been listening.

Let us transition. Let us transition into listening through your heart, which will allow, as your heart is open, your soul perceptions to become evident to you.  You are the soul. That is the part of you that is created in the Image of God. It is the soul that has incarnated into your body. This body is a gift from the elements of Earth, created and given by God. Then you have your material mind, again created and given as a gift by God, in order that your soul, which is imbued with a purpose and a mission, may express and demonstrate that mission and purpose.

As you grow in your capacity to understand the role these three parts of you play in fulfilling what you are here on Earth to do, you can come to understand the blessing that each part of you plays. Your body is carrying your soul through this material, earthly experience. Your mind, when in its highest purpose, serves the wisdom of the soul, and is in great alignment. As you have experienced much on Earth in your life, and there is a reverence for your material consciousness, the soul has been greatly dampened, suffocated in various ways. In order to awaken the soul, allow yourself to return to the One that has created you and to receive this great Substance of Love within the soul.

How do you do this if you are not familiar with your soul? There is much that you have experienced here in life. These experiences at times can be traumatic, causing great sorrow and grief and for you to close down into your own worries and sorrows. It requires an open heart and soul to reach God. You must come from both angles: healing those wounds, acknowledging your sorrows, and being willing to be open and vulnerable. Be open and vulnerable to the One who has created you, for it is with that inflowing of Love that this Substance, this Divine Love, can heal your wounds, your sorrows, those patterns and habits that are not in harmony with creation and what you truly desire to do by following the wisdom and the blessings that rest within the soul.

My dear friends, may you come to be open within your mind and allow yourself to be open and soft within your heart. For the heart is that midheaven between the soul and the mind. When your heart is open and you are relaxed and receptive, you can then hear the whispers of the soul. As you receive this great Essence from God's Love, this very Substance of God, a transformation is happening within the soul, transforming it into the imagery it was originally created in, into Divinity, that part of God's Divinity.

It is through the soul that you commune with God. Allow yourself to be nurtured and blessed every day, merely by offering an opening to that deep feeling within yourself, at any moment and anytime. These are your longings. These are your yearnings, the true desire that rests within your soul. Know that through your sincere longings and desire to be blessed by this Love, you shall be. That is a truth according to your desires and your sincere longings to come to know and have a beautiful communion and union, a relationship with the One that has created you. This shall begin to formulate.

As you grow and your soul develops by the grace of God's Essence, your material mind, the spiritual mind, and your body become a beautiful vehicle for the unfolding of your soul's mission. May each of you yearn deeply in these moments while we are together. Come to befriend your soul. Come to know who you are, to allow the perceptions of your soul to awaken the eyes of your soul, the ears of your soul and the voice of your soul. We, your Celestial friends, are here to serve you.

May each of you be mightily blessed by this deep inflowing as you allow your souls to open with their longings for God's blessing of Love. I am Keea Atta Kem. God bless you.
