Orion received by Al Fike

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Orion. Change is one constant in the universe. All is flowing toward greater harmony. As this flow continues, then all those elements that are in harmony with God, God's creation, God's universe, continue to conspire, to assist all that is not in harmony to be transformed and to flow toward harmony. Because of this law, you have much assistance. Many aspects of God's universe are working, striving toward assisting you and this world to come to that harmony.

There is focus and effort, blessings and much in the way of individual support and love that continues to flow toward you all. Without the support, I dare say that it would be a very long road indeed. Even though you have the support, often, you feel alone or you are much more obliged to walk the road alone. This is the human condition continuing to affect your choices and your life. Where much can be given in the way of support, guidance, upliftment, often is ignored in favour of the comfort of your own mindful desires and efforts to be independent and steadfast in your autonomy.

There is a need for humility here, my beloved friends, to admit that you are very vulnerable and in need of support, to admit that that support is crucial and to admit that God in your life is needed in every part of your life. That challenge continues to hold you in a dilemma of what you might do individually and autonomously and what you may do as a group, what you may do in concert with your angel friends and stellar friends and in concert with God and His blessings. Know that the door will continue to be open. Know that indeed you continue to open that door, although at times it is wide and at times it is narrow, but it continues to be open.

This is important. Do not allow your propensity toward the human condition to determine the outcomes of your life. Rather, strive toward unity with God, alignment with God and all that God is and all that God gives. You will find yourself far happier and at peace. The mind will not be so predominant, the worries and cares influencing your decisions. Rather, as you go with the flow of God's Love and all that is contained within that, a blessing and flow will indicate the Will of God in your life, all that may come as part of that Will. There is so much for you to truly understand, to truly embrace, to truly be a part of, but you must reconcile that part of you that is fiercely independent with that which is dependent upon God, dependent upon all that is of God.

This is your soul in its vulnerable place. This is your soul dominated by that desire of the mind to be invulnerable and in control. Yet, the tides must turn, my friends, and in so doing, there is a place in this juxtaposition that is extremely vulnerable. You must face this, that angst, that place that feels alone, that place who has fought for independence and invulnerability. That place is a reflection of your struggles within the human condition. This is the place you must go and be honest with the power it has implicated within your life, the power that has control of many things, a power that is based on fear, a power that in many respects lacks love. You must heal this place with love, with the wisdom of your soul and the light of your soul, that you may walk in the world not so enthralled with those necessities of human perception and desire, but with the surety of the soul, knowing, feeling, perceiving that which is of the divine.

In this way, you will find great solace, comfort and strength, great love for yourself and compassion for others. For when that place is healed, when the love pours in and is strong and is a powerful current in your life, you will find joy and relief, great healing, the balance of your true self expressing its rightful place within your consciousness. There the blessings will flow, the manifestations will take place and all that is good of God shall be a part of your life. It is a matter of reconciliation, the mind and soul, of acknowledging that vulnerability and realising that you must cross that chasm to the other side, which is true being in harmony with oneself and with God, with the universe and knowing the freedom that comes with this, the joy and the flow of love and light all around you and within you. It is coming close, and we will help you bridge that chasm and find your way.

May you be blessed, my beloved friends, on the journeys you must take and the efforts you must make, for you are not alone, never will be. God is there to comfort you. God is there to guide you. When you make that great leap, God will uphold you. God bless you, my friends. Orion loves you. God bless you in Love.
