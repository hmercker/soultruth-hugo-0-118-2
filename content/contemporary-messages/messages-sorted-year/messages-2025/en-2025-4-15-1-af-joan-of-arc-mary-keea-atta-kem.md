Jeanne d'Arc, Maria & Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Joan, known to you as **Joan of Arc**. I come to uphold my sisters, those who continue to strive for light, those who continue to express love and those who are strong and desire to bring harmony to the world. I am here for you. Many are here for you, beloved daughters, women of the world and those who have daughters. I am here and many surrounded you in your time of retreat, prayer and conversation. God brought healing to many. I come to affirm you all in the light of truth in your struggles and desires to be in light and to express truth in your lives.

What gave me strength on Earth was the guidance from God. In my soul, I knew what my destiny was and I followed this understanding to the very end. My wish for each, not only the women but the men as well, is that you might know your destinies, that you might follow your guidance and that you may work to bring God's Will through you. As you do so, you will know the glories and the blessings that come to those who are God's servants and those who are in alignment with God's Will.

My beloved, beloved brothers and sisters, you are all within the Hand of God. You are touched by God's Holy Spirit. You are coming to understand your true self and true nature, coming to understand the gifts that rise up from the soul as God blesses you with His Holy Touch of Love. Acknowledge what is coming to your conscious self. Acknowledge the strength, the wisdom and the gifts that are within. In this way, God will use you more completely and God's Will will flow through you with His blessings upon everyone in your circles, in your daily life and in your prayerful efforts. Everyone is blessed by the dedicated and penitent souls who seek to be in alignment with God's great plan for the salvation of humanity.

Be true to yourselves. Be true to your nature whether you are a man, woman or child, all are loved by God and God gives freely His Love to all, unconditional and transformative. It is given and it is given in abundance. May you know the upliftment, the joy and the wonderment in this relationship between your soul and God's Soul, that it may be conscious, that it may be realised and intensified, developed and transformed by this great gift of Love, so that you may be that child, that instrument and that light in the world.

May God bless you all and know for those who are in need, those who struggle in the world, that the angels are ever present and desire to uphold, to heal and to uplift in love. God provides every way and means that you may come into light and harmony. It is given. It is the law that as one prays sincerely and desires for the highest, so the highest blessings come and are bestowed upon each one who is there and present for God and with God. My beloveds, I am Joan. I love you dearly and I am with many of you often. God bless you. God bless you all. My love is with you.

I come as well, on the heels of love and prayer, on the onrush of God's blessings upon you. I am with you. I uphold you and I love you. Feel the comfort of my love. Know the great blessing of God's Love. All is given as you desire and seek out this blessing. God bless you, beloveds. I am **Mary** and I love you.

**Keea Atta Kem** loves you. I have been with you, beloved daughters, your journey of faith, your prayerful times and your efforts to clear the debris of the injustices and the violations that are so much a part of your world. I have been with you. We have all been with you in this effort toward light, truth and love. Keea Atta Kem loves you, beloveds. We all love you dearly and embrace you fully. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
