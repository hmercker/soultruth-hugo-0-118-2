# Getting past your wounds - Part 1

May 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

My dear ones I am Care.

I come with a large band of your guides today. You can consider this a spiritual orchestra, for together we try to influence and orchestrate these gatherings so that those who need to attend will be guided to do so, and thus you are all here.

And as the beautiful Barb [^1] has suggested, step forward in that leap of faith. Realize your gifts and know that when you do this in the love of God, there are no wrong choices, for you are benefiting the world at large and your brothers and sisters in the near. I wish to speak just a bit about feminine energy, and of course, some of you know that we are the more feeling gender generally. And you may have noticed that the men in your community, by and large, are in touch and comfortable with their feelings and, as you would say, their feminine side. For those who have difficulty being in touch with their heart, with their soul longings, they have no problem accessing the mental concepts and intellectual truths, but it is difficult for them to be in their hearts, because they have built a protective wall or bubble around them, and with good reason in most cases. So how does one affect them or influence them in a way that allows them to be in touch with their feelings so that they can go into their souls, fearlessly in peace, allowing God to bless them with the great inflowing of His love?  There are many ways. Loving kindness, along with prayer; A song from the heart that opens it up; Sometimes a reading; It could be a great poem; it could be a message that someone has received. Or it could just be a simple act of kindness that they had not anticipated. I tell you this because there are, amongst your community, those who do have difficulties allowing their hearts to be opened, and you may help them in this way that all may receive the love of God, that all may be lifted, that those wounds may be healed.

I wish to acknowledge my dear sister who I have known for many years, and I have been spending some time with her lately, and I wish to acknowledge her acceptance and growth with her gifts and how she has utilized them to the advantage of many, for she is, indeed, the blessing medium. I also feel as if I know you all, for I have attended many of these circles.

I wish to remind you, lastly, that when you are in need, when you feel separated, when you cannot access or you feel you cannot access your soul, number one, talk to God or simply ask your guides to come. For we do not refuse, and we come in joy and are so delighted whenever oneâ€™s soul is lifted in receiving the love of God.

I shall step back, and the orchestra will play on your soul strings in this prayer as the love of God fills each one of you and his light descends upon this room. I love you all and I thank you. I am your sister in Christ. I am Care.
