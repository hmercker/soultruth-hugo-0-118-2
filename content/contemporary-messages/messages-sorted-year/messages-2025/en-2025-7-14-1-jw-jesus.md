Jesus received by Jimbeau Walsh

Beloved brothers and sisters, it is said, ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’, and I shall say that a true prayer is beyond all words. For whatever considerations have brought you to this place, this gathering of beautiful and sincere souls brings the heavenly Father’s love. For you have all come to receive it, to be at one with your Creator beyond the words in the beauty and magnificence and the stillness of Divine Love. The Holy Presence is the knowing of the heavenly Father, and I am very pleased that you have come together to receive what is beyond words and beyond the world, pouring forth from the Father’s soul, touching each one.

I ask you to remember the importance of being still, listening to the small, still voice of God speaking to your soul and the ministrations of His celestial angels. I come in this blessing to each one here with all my love and gratitude, and joy. May it be yours in the silence. May God’s love be upon you.

I am Jesus. May peace be yours.
