Harrow Retreat, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Estelle Roberts & Augustine received by Al Fike

**Estelle:** It is me, Estelle, who is with you and who heartily endorses the efforts that you are making, all of you for the church and for the congregation of the church.

I want you to know that we are working diligently to influence and draw many into that church for the days that these beautiful bright souls will be there. There will be souls that will be opened and touched by Godâ€™s Love, by light, by insight, by perception and possibly even manifestation. I never left that church, even when I progressed into the spirit world. I have always had a fondness and a connection with your beautiful church and I will continue in my ways to help uphold this church of yours, for it feels like my church as well. It is important that there is a place of sanctuary in the world for those who are seekers and for those who understand and wish to understand about the life of spirit.

These lovely souls will come and speak about the life of the soul. This too is a very important subject, most important. I am very pleased that they are coming. Indeed, we have worked hard to clear the way for them to come. We are very pleased with the efforts that the two dear souls of the church have made and those that are a part of that. There will be much to do while you are there, my beautiful friends. There is much in the way of connection, conversation and prayerful communion that will help to alleviate some who are suffering, some who are confused and some who are in need of compassion, comfort and truth. There is much work and I dare say that you will not be here only once, but other times in the coming years. I see you coming back and extrapolating on the efforts that you have made in this first foray into this little church of ours.

God bless you. I am Estelle and I am glad that you are speaking, meeting and making your plans, and we will be close. Our beloved friends from overseas will feel the power of the church, the beautiful energies that are there. They will benefit from them and this will help propel them and uplift them in their ways and communications and prayers with everyone. Yes, a good crowd, a good crowd is coming. Prepare yourselves, my friends, for what will be an extraordinary visit.

We are working diligently to ensure that all is well in harmony and peace and that we together will help uplift those who are coming and those who are seeking the blessings of God upon us, all beautiful souls of light. All of you are precious and beautiful in your light and your love. God bless you all. God bless you all. My love is with you all.

**Augustine:** The goal is to unlock the door of truth for those who are willing to listen and hopefully apply the truth that will be given. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I too will be there as you continue in your efforts to bring the Truth of Divine Love to the world. Many will be there, far greater numbers than will fill the pews of that church. Far greater numbers of spirit will accompany you and will be there to listen and to observe.

It is a great work. It is important to know, and I am sure all of you are well aware, that the work you do on the Earth plane is magnified in the spirit world and many souls benefit from this work. We continue in our travels, our efforts and your desire to serve humanity. You will be influential and loving channels for whomever you will encounter, both in the physical and the spiritual.

God bless you, my friends, my beloved students. I am Augustine and I love you all. God bless you.
