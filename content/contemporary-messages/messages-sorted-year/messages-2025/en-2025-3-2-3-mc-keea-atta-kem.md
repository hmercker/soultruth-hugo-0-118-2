Keea Atta Kem received by Maureen Cardoso

It is the power of Divine Love, beloved souls, that is the answer to everything. I am Keea Atta Kem. I am happy to join you as you open your souls for the longings to flow out, receiving God's response, the inflowing, through His Holy Spirit, the Substance and Essence of His very Soul into your soul. This merging and blending is a transformation that continues to be underway and is strengthened and empowered through every prayer and every opening of your soul.

We say, and it is a truth, that God's Love is the answer to all things that are upsetting, unsettling and out of harmony. As your soul grows in the Divine Essence and is awakened, you can begin to perceive the stirrings and have awareness of this deeper part of you. It is inspiring and ignites a fire within you to search for more, as you notice the changes happening within you. You recognize soulful promptings. You can perceive greater awareness. The eyes of your soul are stirring up into your physical eyes and helping you to be able to perceive beyond the physical, attuning yourself more to those things of the spiritual.

If you allow this Substance to remedy all that concerns you, in your struggles, and in the challenges that you see your loved ones going through, you will learn to become very grounded within your inner being, where these other parts of you, your spirit body, your mind and your physical body, grow in its integration. There is a beautiful, harmonious flow from a soul that is awakened in God's Love. This Love flows your interactions through the energy of your soul, interacting through your spirit body into your mind, bringing insights and truth. You experience this in your physical nature and your ability to make real change to be the channel of love you desire, you begin to see this coming into fruition in your life.

Those things that once troubled you and concerned you no longer have a gravitational pull, because it is through the transformation of your human condition that the energy of your soul, its beauty, its gifts, and Love can flow more readily and easily. Your human condition does not have as dense of a filter on your awareness of your soul. As you come, many times throughout your day, into the openings and allow your soulful longings to exercise the desire and yearning for greater transformation into the Father's Substance, you are nurturing your ability to become that clear, continuous channel of the Divine. The Essence that you carry of the Divine Love is a real, working Substance, active in energy, transforming you.

Allow this blessing, this blessing of Love and the Substance of faith, to grow within you and to take root in your mental attitude, trusting. Trusting what is happening within you, welcoming the changes, even though, at times, as you are expiating some human condition that is no longer serving you and its transformation, you can feel the turbulence within. Steady this in prayer, beloveds. Steady this with the awareness of the beauty of your soul. Trust what is happening to you and for you. Know that the power that is growing within your souls and its ability to rise up, to shine forth, is all well underway.

Yet, you must pray for this. You must long for this. You must truly desire to experience the transformation, the New Birth of your soul, for all things are placed in your hands. Know, dear ones, that every time you come before God and you bear your soul, you allow ts love to flow, its yearnings and longings to be known by God, that you grow. You grow in your love. You grow through the transformation. You deepen the ability to act as that channel where your reflexive choice is love, and all that you can do is to be love. This is coming to every soul that prays for the transformation, that prays for God's Love to touch them. This is coming.

Allow your life to be an experience of longing, where you remain open, where you allow your material mind to be very curious about the transformation that is happening within its soul and how this mind is changing and desiring to serve the insights, the soulful wisdom that can rise into your consciousness. Embrace the journey, beloved souls. Allow yourself the transformation, the gift of the New Birth, as it comes in, drop by drop.

I am Keea Atta Kem, praying with you and for you. God bless you.
