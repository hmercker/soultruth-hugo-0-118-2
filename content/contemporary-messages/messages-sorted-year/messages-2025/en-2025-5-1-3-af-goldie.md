# A Sigh of Relief for Those Who Open Their Souls to Receive

May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025

Anaheim Retreat, Anaheim, CA, USA

Goldie received by Al Fike

It is warm and light. It brings a sigh of relief to the soul that ever seeks this Touch. My beloved friends, seek out the joy, the expansion of this Love, opening and changing you, enlightening you and bringing peace to you.

It is given with the Breath of God upon you. It is given with the mercy of God to uplift you. It is given in the glory of God to empower you. The Love of God is the great gift, the greatest gift of all. It is given freely. Seek it. Seek it always and you will know its secrets, its blessings and joy.

I am Goldie. I love you all, my beautiful friends of Earth. It is good that you seek out this gift and know that great sigh that comes within the soul that says, *â€œI have found You, my beloved Father in Heaven. I have found You and I will never let You go, for I love You so."* God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
