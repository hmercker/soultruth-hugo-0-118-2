# We Have a Preview of This Love as We Live Upon This Earth

John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, beloved souls. I am John Hughes. I walk with this soul, this medium, through most of her days. We will be with you today, each and every one of you, as we move forward in the Love of our Father. So great is this Love. Each of you possess some of it and there are many more in this universe, created specifically for sharing this Love among all.

This is a priceless gift, this gift of Love from our Creator, one which we must ask for each and every time we desire to receive it, but the way in which we ask is not verbal. It is with our souls, longing, longing for truth, longing for Love, longing for God, because we know each and every one of us in our souls know that our Father is where we are headed to become at one, to join together in this Love and continue to express this Love in so very many different ways every moment for the rest of our lives, which goes on and on.

We have a preview of this Love as we live upon this Earth. We have given to us many opportunities to express this Love, to join together in prayer, to give our love to our Father. We have many opportunities to serve God by expressing this Love to our brothers and sisters without a thought involved. Thus, we pray each day to love our brothers and sisters. We pray each day to receive this gift of Divine Love. We pray each day to be in service to our Creator, so that as a whole, love is expressed, Divine Love is expressed, and with it comes the joy and the happiness that spread across the universe. This is our function. This is our purpose, to express this Divine Love. Acknowledging this, one begins to comprehend the majesty of the Father's Love for His children.

So, children, we ask you now to open your souls and allow your longings to touch the Soul of God and God that you may be blessed with even greater Love than you had coming into this prayer. Allow your souls to open and express this love to your Creator. His blessings will touch your souls, and you will feel contentment, joy and peace. You will know guidance, truth and so much love.

I am with you throughout this day to inspire you to march on in Love, in this Divine Love. I am your brother, John Hughes. It is my pleasure deep within my soul to come and speak with you today. I thank my sister for being so open. May God bless abundantly each and every one of you.
