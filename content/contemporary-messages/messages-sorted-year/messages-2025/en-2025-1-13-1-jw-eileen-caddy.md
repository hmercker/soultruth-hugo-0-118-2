Eileen Caddy received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the light of God’s love surround you and be with you. I am your sister in Christ, Eileen Caddy.

I came to my brother here earlier today to let him know that I wished to speak this evening, and he was delighted that the lovely sister [^1] read a message from me from a few years back.

Times have changed, as they do, and things on earth have become more precarious, many people on this planet that you live on are praying for safety, praying for peace, praying for the new age that is promised to finally come, that this world may be changed in love, human and divine. When you pray with all your heart from the depths of your soul, you send out a magnetism that connects with the soul of God, Who is sending out love. On the human level, when you wish for something, you send out a desire for it, and this attracts the object of your desire. What happened in my community at Findhorn from a very humble beginning, my family and I living on the dole was that we sent out a desire to create community, a spiritual community, a sustainable community, and as some of you may know, we attracted those like-minded souls with many, many gifts and created the very thing we envisioned, and I might even say beyond. To those of you who wish to create sanctuary, envision from whatever continent you’re on, whatever country you’re in, whatever condition, whether you are rich or have an empty pocketbook, and send this to God, along with the longings in your souls to receive the most sustainable gift, the great love of God, His Divine Love.

Magnetism is part of the Law of Attraction. There is of course in the world everything from animal magnetism to the magnetism of those who wish to have power, the magnetism of money; the entire spectrum which ranges from attracting the bare necessities for sustenance to mansions. We at Findhorn knew that our mansions would be in the heavenly kingdom, but still, we co-created a beautiful place, a spiritual place, a sustainable place. I believe it is the Creator’s wish for these things to go together, for you are not in the spirit world and you need protection, you need sustenance, you need to consider your children and your children’s children and what you will leave them. First and foremost, the great truth of God’s love and with that, together, a planet in recovery, peace, brotherhood and sisterhood, community, cooperation, joy, music and art, gardens-a-plenty, all created in love. This, I wish for you and encourage you to consider making it your wish for the sake of the world, for the sake of your souls. We shall continue to protect you and nourish you as best we can, but we encourage you to prepare, and we shall assist you in the love of God. Ask and you shall receive. Knock and the door will be opened.

I thank you. I love you. Go in peace. I am Eileen Caddy. My friends, I am still with my brother here and I wanted to add to you, to my message, simply this: what is created in community has its ups and downs and when you make the foundation the eternal love of God, it will carry you through and allow the work that is done to go on and be given. I shall step back in this prayer, and I thank you.
