# Elaborates on Development and Al's Opening Presentation

St Michael, Barbados

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Greetings to you, my friends. I am Seretta Kem. I wish to elaborate somewhat on what the dear instrument has been telling you about development.

He mentioned the faculties of the brain, how some of these faculties are dormant and some quite active. Indeed, the lower aspects of your brain, that which you call the “animal brain,” have seated within them highly intuitive faculties that allow the communication of the spirit of the individual, and I am speaking about humanity here, that this communication is made possible by the stimulation of those aspects of the lower brain.

Of course, what dominates humanity at this time is the well-developed frontal brain and those parts that create thought, deduce and perceive experience. At one point in human development, these elements were all in balance and harmony together and worked and functioned beautifully together. Now there is a great imbalance. It is a reflection of your culture and your way of life. Thus, the more intuitive parts are not so well-recognised, although they are often more dominant within women than men, because women are more receptive to feeling, and feeling is an avenue of perception of lower aspects of brain physiology.

This does not mean that women are less developed in many other ways. Indeed, there are many, many highly intelligent women, possibly more so than men. But the way in which that intelligence has been expressed is different. It is the root of thought that is different because aspects of the brain are more listened to, shall we say, they are heard. We are helping you to bring these aspects into a conscious state of mind. This may feel odd to you. There are pressures and sensations, most of which you are perceiving in an intuitive way rather than a physical way because there are no feeling sensors within the brain in terms of material sensation.

As we create and nurture that highly sensitive part, honed and realised through our efforts, the ability of the energy system of the spirit body is now able to connect more readily with the material mind. We line up these aspects of your being to help enhance consciousness as well. The core of this, the great pulsing energy, light aspect of your being, which is your soul, may then send its signals through your spirit body, which is in greater alignment and has greater sensitivity, into your brain and into your consciousness. This will stimulate, for some, detailed visions and colours, for others, words and voices, for others, a combination of these things. For al there will come, a feeling, a sense, an intuitive sense, of what is happening and what is being communicated. The feeling sensations, even with the body, the soul, the spirit, and the mind, all experiencing something that is not entirely physical.

We have studied these things greatly, all of those aspects of your being, your physical being. Of course, we do not possess a physical body. So, we must study your physical body and observe it. At times, we experiment with it, although often you would not notice or feel anything in this regard. For we would never do anything that would harm you, my beloved friends. But, we are learning through our experiences with you and you are learning through your experiences with us. We are continuing to develop and hone these abilities, for they will become very important in the future.

Some of you begin at the beginning, a rudimentary form of development. Some of you are well on your way. Some of you require very little from us. Still, these aspects of development may continue to be refined, honed and tuned to a place that is most satisfactory. We are together, my friends, to be worked upon, to grow within our souls, grow within our spirits and grow within our minds so that all are in harmony. All may indeed work together and function together in that harmony, so that you may have a very satisfactory experience and understanding of the greater part of life. For what you know now as the physical life is a minor part of life. You will come to understand this greater and more complex part that is your spiritual being, which is very much determined by the state of your soul and, to a lesser degree, the state of your mind.

So, we continue in this development to help awaken you to the potentials that exist within each one of you, many of which are unique and many of which are similar. Yet, you are all human beings, brothers and sisters. I urge you all to love and honour one another, to be curious about one another and to be curious about your own self, what makes you you, how you may come to understand these things and not only understand but to develop further the unique and beautiful qualities that you possess. God has created you to progress and to continue to grow. You have heard that calling from God. You have heard that desire. You know that desire from your own inner being and we will progress together.

My beautiful friends, I am Seretta Kem and I am happy to speak to you today. My love is with each one of you. Know that you have an immense amount of support with you. Together, we shall accomplish much. Blessings to you, my friends. May the great Love of God enter your soul in great abundance, great abundance to stimulate and to direct this development. God bless you. God bless you.
