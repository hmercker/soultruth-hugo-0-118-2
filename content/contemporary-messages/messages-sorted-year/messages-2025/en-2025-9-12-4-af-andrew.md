# The Power of Unity Can Change the World

September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Andrew received by Al Fike

Unity has a great power, beloved souls. The power of love to unify is something that can change the world. When you express your love toward one another and your love toward God, when that love comes from the soul and that love from the soul to God and God's Love through the soul, then the force of unity may be utilised to bring blessings for another and for many. You are each unique and separate from one another. Yet, there is the capacity within the soul to be unified in love. That is what we wish for you, beloved souls, to utilise that sense of bond and love together to make for a great unifying force that can be utilised, both here and elsewhere, to bring blessings to others.

I am Andrew. I come to encourage you in love. Even though you have different cultures and different perspectives, if you are able to find that sense of unification and peace together, then you are doing a great service for God. You are allowing God's blessings to flow through you and collectively a great blessing from you into the world. Allow your hearts to be open to one another. Allow yourself to be open to God and all the goodness, all the beauty of a soul so tender, but so full of love, is what is needed in your world. That will bring healing and peace to your world, when your souls are in alignment with God's great Soul and you become a powerful channel of many blessings for the world.

Be at peace, my beautiful friends. Know that as each soul is healed, each body is healed, each spirit is healed, then the power of God's manifestation, a blessing through you, grows with this healing, with this alignment. May you each be blessed with the Father's Love. May you come to know the unity, the harmony and the peace that comes with this fellowship, this combined soulful, loving friendship that you create together. God bless you, beloved souls. Andrew loves you dearly. God bless you.
