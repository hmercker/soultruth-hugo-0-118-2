# I Come with Compassion, Upliftment, Healing and Peace

September 13<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Estonia Retreat, Tallinn, Estonia

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am Jesus. I come to bring light into your midst. The earnestness of our dear brother who wishes for the world to not have the suffering and pain that it is in, is truly his desire and I acknowledge this.

Yet, I come with compassion and healing and peace for you all, for I know that in time—how long that time will be, I do not know—but I see that the future of humanity will be light and harmony. I have great faith, my brothers and sisters. I have great faith in you all, as you seek to rise above, to be in that state of harmony and at-onement and alignment with God. I come to uplift you, my beloveds, truly, for I love each one as truly my brother and my sister upon the path.

I love you, beloveds. I love you. We are with God. Open yourselves wide, accept the gift of Love and feel the peace that passes all understanding, for we are His children, all of us. We shall be evermore. I love you. I am Jesus and I love you.
