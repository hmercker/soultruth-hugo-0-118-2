There is still much to do, my beloved friends. I am Orion. Much to do in the recalibration, adjustment of your mindful perceptions, thoughts and attitudes. There is much to do in clearing the path between your mind, your material mind, and your soul, the mind of your soul. There is much to do to strengthen and expand your soul in the Divine Love of God. There is much to do in every aspect of the work that you have taken on.

For you have started from a very meagre place and aspire to lofty goals. Therefore, every day represents an opportunity to grow and to develop, to awaken and be transformed. Each day that you have within you a clear desire and attitude and make a concerted effort to be in greater alignment with those things that the soul, those things of our Creator, then that day is a good day. Those efforts are good efforts. For what can you accomplish on the material plane that has not been accomplished before, has not been dedicated by others to make firm a reality of the human imagination and creation? There is nothing you can do, beloved souls, that will contribute to this.

Our urging is to focus upon what you can do and what you are meant to do and that is to develop your soul as best you can, to be truly in alignment with all that which is of soul and of your Creator. This is the frontier that is not well understood or known by humanity. There are many other aspects of human creation and endeavour that are well populated by earnest individuals, well-meaning and desiring to know and to understand and to create those things that are of material concern. The further they get in their development and in their creations, the further away they get from the balancing and necessary condition that is that of the soul awakening. When these things are done in equal measure, then harmony ensues. When they are done in the present unbalanced way, then disharmony comes.

Our efforts, my dear friends, are not of the material nature. They are of the spiritual nature. Our efforts must be focused and diligent and earnest in this regard. Who is going to show the way? Who are the researchers, the scientists of the soul? Who are the ones that will have the wisdom and the proof that the soul is needed, required to express true knowledge, true awakening, true existence in your world? The material pursuits of man are folly in comparison to the spiritual pursuits of each individual soul. Humanity will continue to develop new trinkets, toys, aspects and material life that can be utilised and incorporated into life, but in truth, many of these things are contrary to life, are contrary to balance and harmony. Yes, they bring gratification and comfort. Indeed, they often offer solutions to problems that were created by the imbalance of human endeavour. Humanity continues to seek out its mindful pursuits in order to solve all the dilemmas and problems in the world. Yet, as they build this great tower of egoistic creation, it is not built on infirm foundations and will topple eventually.

A tower built on soulful considerations, balanced with material considerations, is far stronger and can indeed outlast anything that has been created to date. With the wisdom of the soul, the creations of man are in harmony with the creations of God, because these creations are co-creations of man and God. Thus the harmony is built into what is made and what is expressed in human endeavour. It must be love that is incorporated in everything. It must be love that will bring harmony to everything. It must be love that will inform wisdom when one is creating and expressing oneself in the world.

There is so much to be done within you and around you, my friends. The world continues to evolve and its trajectory is in a direction that will ensure a collapse of your cultures and societies and all that humanity has put together in their own mindful conceits, but parallel to this are your efforts and the efforts of others to build upon a firm foundation of truth. As one collapses, the other shall rise. As the folly of humanity is seen, the truth of the soul will be recognised. You will play an important part in this, each one of you, though you may wonder how, you will see as time progresses what your role will be and what your gifts will entail.

Much is given to you, my friends. Many work diligently on your behalf and you, my beloved and beautiful friends, must work diligently on God's behalf and your own. For as you build, so this truth will remain steadfast, so your example will be clear and beautiful, so you will be a channel, an expression of light in the world, bringing light to where darkness now reigns, bringing truth where error is so powerful in its existence, bringing healing where there is so much pain and disharmony. Love is the answer to all these things. It will be understood in time. You will find your way upon that path of service to bring the truth to humanity, to truly be God's instruments in the world. We are here to serve you, to serve God and to serve humanity. All this service comes with love. All is predicated on love.

May you find your way, my beloved friends. The path is clear. The road is lined with many beautiful and bright souls willing to support you, to cheer you on. God's Hand is upon you. There is nothing that you require, my beloved, beautiful friends, other than the discipline that is necessary to complete the task at hand, to be truly an instrument of love, light and truth. Seek out the solutions, for they lie in God's Touch and Love. Seek out the guidance, for God shall give it to you. Seek out the light, for God sheds Light upon you. God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. I love you dearly. God bless you.
