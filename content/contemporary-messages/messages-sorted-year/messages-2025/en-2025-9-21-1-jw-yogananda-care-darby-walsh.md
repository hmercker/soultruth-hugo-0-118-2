# May your Guidance by Celestial rather than Terrestrial

September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2025

England Retreat, Newquay, Cornwall, UK

Yogananda & Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

**Yogananda:** I am here, your brother, Yogananda, your celestial friend, and I shall be your guide today.

It is often a great challenge to be faced with the dichotomy of the mind versus the soul. For in the material world, the mind is everything, and in the spiritual realms, it is the soul that informs the mind. If you rest in your heart, God can open up your soul. If you allow the soul longings to be in ascendancy over your minds, God can bless you. For all beings wish to be happy, and though they may find inappropriate ways, inharmonious ways to reach a state of happiness that always fail to achieve that goal, all things conspire for the soul to break through. And whether it cries out to its Creator or simply opens, having exhausted all of the earthly pathways, it eventually overcomes all those things that have prevented it from opening and receiving the great gift of God’s love.

My dear brothers and sisters, relax, for the world is not ending. What needs to fall away will, and you will gladly let go as you become more and more absorbed in the great essence of the Creator. We who live in harmony and bliss everlasting are in a constant state of receiving but also giving this gift and you should know, despite what you may think, that our love for you is never-ending.

Our wish for you to be at one in the love with God and with us, compels us to assist you, for if you consider how few wish this blessing consciously, and yet, seek it, albeit through ways that do not succeed, you can see as you grow in the love of God, that you can love every soul in that love, realizing that deep down they wish to have what you have. They long for what you long for.

I tell you, my brothers and sisters, there is much work to be done, but let it be a work of joy, for you know when you give, you receive so much more. So, go, find that place where you can receive and allow in prayer, as I have said earlier, allow your souls to be in ascendancy, that your guidance will be celestial rather than terrestrial. Reach out to the world in the love of God, that the world may be drawn by your spiritual magnetism to find out the great truth of transformation of the soul that our heavenly Father wishes us to have, for whatever is given will be returned tenfold in the heavenly reward.

Whatever impels you to reach out to another, whatever their condition, take that leap, step forward, deliver the love, and you will see the results. God will take care of all the rest. I shall come again, and I tell you with all the love in my soul, whenever you call on me, I shall come. I am your brother and friend in the celestial heavens, the little yogi who became a divine angel. This is your destiny. May God bless you.

I am Yogananda. 

**Care:** I am here, Care.

I come with my beloved, in gratitude, and I wish to thank the hosts for bringing my dear one here. I see how delighted he is, how relieved he is to be in a place where prayer is easy; the longing is here. I will also come if you need me to come. I hope that you will have these moments of prayer, so that you will receive a great inflowing of the Father’s love. I tell you there is no better use of your time than to sing and pray and speak from your souls. On behalf of all those here, I thank you. May you all be very blessed these days together. Be blessed, be changed, and be joyful. Rejoice. I love you.

I am Care.
