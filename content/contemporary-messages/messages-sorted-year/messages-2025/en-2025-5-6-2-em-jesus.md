# The Freedom of God's Love

May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025

Celebrity Cruise Retreat

Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I bless you mightily. I am your brother. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens. I come today to love you, to pray with you, to uplift you and to share with you the joy, the blessing of Love, the Divine Love that offers you such total freedom: Freedom to love all your brothers and sisters; Freedom unencumbered by any ill will toward your fellow human beings; and freedom to express God's Divine Love in every aspect of your lives.

Such freedom you have never experienced, but you will as you grow in this Love, as you grow in the Truth of your relationship with our Father, which will make clear to you your relationship with your brothers and sisters across the universe and in the spirit world. For with His Love, there are no limitations. This Love is freedom.

I come to share that with you today and to give a special blessing to our sister (Catherine), who came into this world on this day several years ago. You are raised above women this day, my dear sister. You are raised because of your work, because of the Love in your soul and because the Father desires it, for your love of Him is great. May you be blessed this day especially. May you enjoy the freedom of loving beyond measure. We in the Celestial Heavens offer you our love unequivocally and we celebrate you.

May the Father bless each and every one of you, those seen and those unseen. I am your brother. I am Jesus and I love you all.
