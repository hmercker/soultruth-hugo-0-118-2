Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Care. Yes, it is I.

I come with brother Confucius. Such a regal and light-filled soul he is. I know many of you struggle with the dichotomy of living on earth with one foot in the drama and the other stepping onto the ladder to the celestial realms with God’s love in your souls, wondering ‘How can I be laid so low at times, feeling the weight of the world, the cruelty, the violence, the inequities and not be upset, concerned, angry’? How can I be in this state, and yet I feel the love of God? Well, as has been said, this is the human condition, but for you, most beloved of the Creator, who hold the great gift in your souls, it is a matter of precedence. For when you are in this grace in the showering of love, feeling of at-onement with all of us in God, all those things that are less than love dissipate.

And for those who feel you are up against inharmonious energies, words that are less than love, actions that seem to come out of darkness, allow the love of God and the empathy that it brings into your souls to pity them. For, as the Master is purported to have said, *“Forgive them Father, for they know not what they do.”* [^1] Embrace them in love whenever you can, and when you come together in prayer, send your light out into the world, that you may illuminate even the darkest corners. Pray that you may awaken this desire in the souls of all.

My dear brother Confucius has tapped me on the shoulder to say he wishes his channelings of Divine Love and its path to one day reach the place where he lived on earth, and to those who honor and remember his writings, that they may be brought into the Divine Love. His gratefulness for his brother [^2], who receives these messages, is beyond words. He has a grin that would transverse the entire planet.

So, with all my love and blessings, I thank you for allowing me this time. From all of us here to all of you, may God bless you and embrace you, and may the great peace be yours. I love you. I am your sister in Christ and your eternal friend.

I am Care. Go in peace.

[^1]: It was received by James Padgett that Jesus never uttered any words on the cross and the words attributed to him were from the Psalms ().. I asked him about this, and he told me he silently prayed this during his execution so I am keeping it in the message.
