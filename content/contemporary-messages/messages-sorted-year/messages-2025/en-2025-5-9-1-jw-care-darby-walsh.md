# How to create Sanctuaries

Creating Divine Love Sanctuary Group, Nashville, TN, USA

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

It is I, Care. My dear ones, if I may use an analogy, from small seeds can grow great trees. In the garden of the earth, you have agreed to plant the seeds of divine truth, and as the parable goes, some seeds will fall on rocks, some will be blown away, and others will fall upon fertile soil. So, as you cast your seeds out and you begin to see the desire for Godâ€™s love sprouting all around the world, you can send your request to create a sanctuary to wherever it may be heard. There are many here who support your efforts. I can tell you, some of these places that you have been attracted to contain all that is necessary to support sanctuary, refuge, sustainability, and some will be given. Still, you must send your request out and realize you have nothing to lose by doing so. You can do this in a formal way, on the internet, through emails, and various forms of media. You can also do it in-house, in your community, and ask for benefactors.

In the meantime, if you are serious about finding the right place, I encourage you to look and when you see something that feels right, share it with this group, with your community, and with those who you feel might be benefactors. For what appears to be a limitation is often just a mental construct, a presumption of limitation. As you pray for this guidance, open to receive, and be blessed with all the possibilities, explore them, and as you do in this prayer group, asking God to bless you with love, and for us to guide you, and ask those on earth for their help because what you wish for becomes more important with each passing day.

Fear not, have faith, trust, and know the heavenly Father is the provider of every good and perfect gift, and we do His bidding with joy. So, as you walk into the future, wherever you decide to dwell, we will bring the love of God with you and create sacred space, and when you gather with others, a portal opens up. So, do not embrace limitation but rather abundance. May the great love of God bless you all, far and near. I hope I have been helpful to you today. I shall watch over this project along with many others. May God bless you with a great inflowing of Divine Love. I am your sister in Christ. I am Care.
