# Blessing for Trini-Tribe

February 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025

San Salvador Estate, Trinidad

Confucius received by Al Fike

Children of God, I am Confucius. I greet you in this place, sacred and holy, filled with love and light. You have all entered this place. You have found your way, for the soul knows its way to God. The soul shall always know its way to God. When you allow the soul to venture forth in this way, you will come to realise the joy that we know and the blessings that we realise in our lives.

Those of us who have followed this road for many, many years take that road daily, moment by moment, for God wants you to commune with Him every day in every moment. He will bless you mightily and bring you to the brink of great joy as you allow yourself to plunge into these Waters of Life and bathe in the loving Touch of God. Beloved souls, you have been given a gift, a mighty gift, knowing the way to God. We ask you to follow that way, for your souls will be overjoyed upon this journey.

Beloved and beautiful souls, may you be blessed in the fullness and richness of this gift of Love. May you know the peace. We are with you. The angels of light surround you. You are being blessed and awakened in the Truth of Love. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I am Confucius. I come to be with you, beloved souls.
