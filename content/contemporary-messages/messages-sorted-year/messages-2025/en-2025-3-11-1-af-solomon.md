# Guidance on How to Live Your Life!

Solomon received by Al Fike

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Solomon. I come to bring you some guidance and wisdom. As you continue to grow in the Father's Love, you continue to make your way toward at-onement with God and eventual inhabitation of the Celestial Kingdom. I might give you some suggestions as to how you might live your life in such a tumultuous condition as the world is in at this time.

I suggest that in situations that seem intractable and immovable, that you be like water, for water moves around an object. Water seeks the path of least resistance. Water can bring harmony and can dissolve even a mountain, in time. When you are like water, those conditions that seem so intractable will, in time, dissolve in the water that is of God’s Love. This beautiful stream and flow of God’s Love shall penetrate even the densest of conditions.

There are other times when you must be solid as a rock, immovable in your own light and truth. For when you are that strong, when you are within the underpinnings of God’s Truth, then no one can take from you the Truth that you carry. In the strength of that solidity, you may express Truth with authority, strength of purpose and dedication. When your faith is like a rock, then you are indeed in alignment with God.

There are times when you might whisper the truth like the wind and be like the wind, travelling from one place to another. Yet, you are moving everything in your path. Everything reacts to this beautiful breeze that is your presence, your breath of life. When you are God’s agent, moving in the world, then, as a gentle breeze, you touch everything. Your light touches the world and all within it. The breath of God comes through you and touches others.

At times, you must be a flame, pure, bright, shining, warm and bringing change and transformation into things that need to be transformed and healed. The flame of Love is the healing flame. It is the flame of transformation. It brings that which is out of harmony back to harmony.

I urge you to use the elements within you, these beautiful aspects of your being, to do God’s work and to be God’s instruments in the world. Think of these elements in the way that I have described them. Think of yourself expressing these things in the ways that are needed. Sometimes, it is more than one thing. Sometimes, it is all things. You will be guided by God, God’s Hand upon you, to show you how to be that instrument, effective, beautiful and powerful.

Much is within you that you do not understand or have sounded the depths of its expression. Yet, as you continue to express yourself as God’s instruments, you will find the depth and power of these expressions. You will find yourself acting in ways that are necessary and in harmony with bringing light, truth, love and compassion. As God’s instrument you may bring all that is needed in your world, providing comfort, helping others find their way toward God and toward the reclamation of their own soul. Sometimes, these expressions are subtle and gentle. Sometimes, they are powerful and direct. It is up to God to direct you in the ways of expression, of instrumentality, of being God’s agent, answering prayer, answering the call for truth, answering the need for love and bringing the warmth of compassion.

They are all within you, beloved souls. They are all a part of you. I ask you, I encourage you, to pray that these elements, these beautiful aspects of your soul, may indeed be expressed in harmony, in light and in love, as they are needed, as God wills, as you move in the world, the breath, the water of your life, the solidity of your soul and the flame of your love. Be all these things and more. This truly will please God when you allow these expressions free reign in your life, flowing, blowing, piercing and enveloping.

May you be blessed, beloved souls, truly blessed in the Father's Love. I am Solomon. I am with you as you traverse your world, in need of all that you must give, in need of all that you might give as God's channels of love, truth and light. God bless you. God bless you all. I love you.
