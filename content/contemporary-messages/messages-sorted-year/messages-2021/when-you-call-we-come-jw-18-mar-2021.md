# When You Call, We Come!

March 18<sup>th</sup>, 2021 

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here your sister and friend, your grandmother, and your beloved. I wish to say that as the light in this circle continues to expand, we can see the light in each soul become ever brighter as it becomes easier and easier to open to the flow of Godâ€™s love. 
    
I see my grandson turning a page and beginning to sense his own journey and the true longings of his soul, and little by little, see the effect that this has. Not only on his own being, but on those around him. And I wish to remind him as well as all here to please remember when you call, we come. For we can never refuse the call from your heart, from your soul, and we have nothing but love for you and joy. 
  
I must say to use your words, that there is a swelling of pride in my heart for the work you do here and for the blessings it is bringing. 
   
I shall step back now. How I love you! How I love you! I am Care.
