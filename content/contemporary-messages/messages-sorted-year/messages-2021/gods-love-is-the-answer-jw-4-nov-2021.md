# God’s Love is the Answer

I am here John, disciple of the Master and your brother in Christ. One should not trouble oneself about those who seem to be teaching what is not true, professing what is not real, or claiming to be who they are not. As you know God is love. Let this be your guide. When considering anything let your soul feel its truth. For when things are in love, given in love, leading in love, there is no doubt, there is no question. When you fall in love you don’t wonder, *“Am I in love?”,* because you simply know, and it is the same discernment. 
     
Follow your heart on the path of Love as you walk through this world. And what is not love, let it disappear, fade into darkness, and dissipate. For the foundation of the Universe is love. This gift of God’s love not only allows one to walk in a state of grace on earth but draws to you those of us in the Celestial heavens who always wish to elevate your thoughts from the human to the Divine. So, I say waste not your time on that which is less than love and you will never be disappointed. 
    
I come in the Grace of God with all my love and wish you every good and perfect gift this day and always. As you head towards your birthday as a Divine angel. God bless you. I am John.
