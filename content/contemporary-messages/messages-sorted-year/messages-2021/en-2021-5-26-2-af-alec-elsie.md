Vancouver Prayer Circle, Berkley Rd, BC, Canada

Alec & Elsie received by Al Fike

I’m Alec. I am so happy to see my beloved friend, Barbara, progress so swiftly for she is truly a remarkable soul. I am happy to say that I have lent my hand in uplifting and assisting her in her progress. With all of you, I continue, as does my beloved sister, to assist you on your journey for it is not that long ago that I passed into spirit and I understand as well your trials and tribulations. So, I am one of the many angels who continue to help you, my beloved brethren upon this Earth plane.

It is our deep desire that this Truth of God’s Love will continue to awaken many souls upon your Earth. So God makes possible this connection between us in the Celestial Kingdom and you upon this earthly plane. This connection continues to grow and the capacities and blessings that come with your prayers together and your prayers singly will continue to grow the light and the possibilities of your progress towards God and the progress of humanity towards greater understanding and truth.

May God bless you on your journeys, beloved souls. I continue to serve God in love, to be a channel of love for others, to be an instrument of peace, and to be your brother in a world in need of many brothers and sisters to help each other along in light. God bless you. I bring a friend to these who are sitting here tonight.

Hello, it is Elsie. I too am happy to be with you all for I knew Alec, I knew Barbara, and I know each of these precious souls in this room. I have taken quite a journey in my life to truly understand my soul and to truly see within me my deep motivations and desires. Indeed,I prayed very, very often to receive the great redeeming Love of God. So, now I am with my beloved soulmate, Alec and we are progressing together. I have some ways to go yet before I reach his level but I wish to assure you all that I am fully now in accordance with the Truth of God’s Love. I have found what I have been looking for all this time and that is the great joy of God’s Love continually infilling my soul. I know now all that I need to know for my journey to be complete and I am with you all. I am often close. Although I know you do not feel me so close, know that I am and will continue to try to be your friend, your sister upon this path. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Elsie. I love you. I love you all so much. God bless you.
