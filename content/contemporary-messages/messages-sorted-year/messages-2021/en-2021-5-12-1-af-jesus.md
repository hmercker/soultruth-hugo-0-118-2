# You come to connect with one another

May 12<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Vancouver Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May the great blessings of the Father's Love continue to flow into your souls, beloveds. As you gather together today you form a beautiful tapestry of light. Its colors and hues reflect the light within your souls. You come to connect with one another, soul to soul, heart to heart, in a world that does not acknowledge the truth that you carry.

But you, beloved souls, continue to walk upon this path divine seeking to be with God, knowing within yourself that you are walking the correct path, the path that your soul longs for. That experience with God sustains you all as it does every soul who seeks God and seeks to be blessed with His Love, this sustaining Touch that transforms and heals the soul so that all may be in harmony and peace, all may be blessed and uplifted. You are all His children, beloveds, you are all His children. And you will continue to find your way upon this path. Indeed you will weave many of these tapestries together, reflecting light and wisdom of the truth for the benefit of those who are with you in spirit and those who are connected to you in the flesh. This tapestry reflects and expresses much light into the world. May you continue, beloved souls, continue on this journey of life, of light, of truth and love. I am with you. I am your brother and your friend, and I come to bless you, beloveds. I am Jesus and I am with you in your prayers.

And in this, a beautiful thread of gold is woven amongst you, a beautiful blessing of light touches each of you and the peace that passes all understanding is a mantle upon you all, beloved souls. We are together in peace and love and truth and joy. Drink deep these waters and be with God at these moments. God bless you. My love is with you, beloveds, my love is with you. God bless you.
