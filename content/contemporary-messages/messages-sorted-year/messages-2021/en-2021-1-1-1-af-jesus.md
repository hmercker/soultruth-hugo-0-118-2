# Your Shackles Have Been Broken

January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come, I am Jesus. The Light of Truth is upon each one of you, beloved souls. Truly, you will come to know this Truth, this way, in a conscious and powerful knowing that will rise up from your souls and flood you with the awareness of God’s Love for you and His Presence within your lives. Those shackles that you might have felt in your lives have been released. Now it is for you to awaken to the Truth, to come to know the Truth in every part of your being and to express love as a natural outpouring of your soul in all that you do and all that you are.

You are blessed, beloved souls, and will continue to be deeply blessed with each day that comes, provided you are eager and willing to receive this gift. It shall come with sincere prayer and the touch of the Holy Spirit upon your soul.

May God bless you upon your awakening, and know that the doors are open wide for each one of you, that you may walk through this threshold and come to be with God in all the Glory and Joy and Wonderment that is God’s Touch upon your soul.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens and I come to bless you this day as you gather forth to celebrate the coming year; a year to be filled with blessings, a year to awaken many souls to Truth, Light, and Love. God bless you. I walk with you and my love is with you. God Bless you.
