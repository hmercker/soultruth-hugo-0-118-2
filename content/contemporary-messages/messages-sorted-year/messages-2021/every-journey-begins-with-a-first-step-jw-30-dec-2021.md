# Every Journey Begins with a First Step  

December 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021 

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   

May the light of God be upon you, may it illumine your souls so that you may carry your light into the world. 

It is said every journey begins with a first step. When you consider things that you have brought to fruition, you can recount the steps, the chapters, the verses, the moments that led to the finale or the completion. If you take every day one step towards that which you wish to be, that which you wish to create, you will come to the fruition of your wishes. And though the journey is eternal, you begin to see the progression from finite to infinite. You begin to sense that which is a blessing to your soul, that sustains it, and transforms it. 

So, have faith, take heart, take that step. God will open the way for you on your journey. 
   
I have not come before to this one, but I have made him aware of my presence the last few days. I am Jude, brother of James, Joseph, Simon and Yeshua, our beloved brother Jesus. I thank you and I shall come again, with your permission. With all my love and the grace of God, may peace be upon you.
