Awaken, my beloveds, awaken to God, His blessings of Love. I am Jesus; I come to be with you and to pray with you as you continue to beseech God to bless your soul and awaken you to all the glories and wonders of His Touch upon your soul. Awaken, beloveds, to the great Light that descends upon you and opens your soul to the inflowing of the great Love, the Essence of God. Awaken, my beloveds, to the peace that passes all understanding, to the glory of the Light that is God’s Presence with us in prayer, to the wonderment that God has made possible for we in the Celestial Kingdom and you upon the Earth plane to pray together in this Light. The glory of God makes all things possible. 

All the wonderment that is God’s blessings and creation is a gift to humanity if they but answer the call and come to God in all earnestness, desire and humility, to come as His true children, to come as souls that yearn, that are thirsty and hungering for the food of the spirit, which God has to give to each child. May you sit at this banquet table and receive willingly God’s bounty, His blessings for you. 
Open yourselves, beloveds, open yourselves to God’s Touch, to God’s Love, to awaken all that is within you, to bring you into alignment and at-onement with God. We are all here for the same purpose: to grow in the Father’s Love, to continue our journey along the Path of Love, to awaken; to awaken to all that is meant to be gifted to us in the name of love, in the name of truth, in the name of light. We are His children, all of us His children, upon this Path Divine. 

Release your worries and cares, beloveds, to God. Feel the upliftment of His Touch. Feel the glory of His Light, His Love, His caring Spirit for all of you. You were created by God and God continues to minister and tend to you as His beloved children. Feel the Gift and Touch of His glorious Hand upon you, awakening, awakening all within and bringing all to harmony, peace, truth and joy.

Blessings to you, beloved souls, blessings of Love, blessings of Love. God bless you. I am your brother and friend. I come to you in all earnestness to assist you on your journey, to uplift you from the conditions of your world, to Light, Light everlasting, glorious Love, glorious peace for you all. God bless you, beloveds, I love you all and am with you always. God bless you.
