# Loving Reminder for the Importance of Our Preparations

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Seretta Kem. As we have assured you and informed you, there are various impe-diments and challenges that will be evident before you come together as a group. For the most part, you have overcome these things to a great degree. I would urge you now to continue to focus your thoughts and prayers upon God, to prepare as best you can for what is needed and what will be required for your efforts together.

There are many distractions in your material world. Often these things become more important than your spiritual life but in this particular time, in these days to come, it is important that you release those obligations as much as can to allow all to fall into place and unfold in harmony with God’s Will. As you allow yourself to enter into the flow of God’s Will and God’s Love, so your chores and obligations will become much easier and less burdensome. We will be there each moment to assist you and uplift you.

It would be wise to continue your prayers throughout the day. A moment of prayer with God will help to sustain the light. Each of you knows of the harmony and the condition that I speak of that is with you when you are close to God and in harmony with God. So this will be your barometer, so to speak, of your condition in these days ahead. Monitor yourself closely. Monitor your thoughts. Monitor your interactions together so that they may be loving and sincere. Do not allow any conditions that are not in harmony with love to be expressed or thought of.

This is your time to immerse yourselves in the beautiful conditions that God will pour upon us all and the conditions that come with our presence with you. Let this be your reality, beloved souls, to be in the world but not of it at this time. It is very important so that what we may achieve together will be readily accomplished rather than our efforts more focused on clearing the conditions that you bring into your circle.

Much of our efforts with mortals is taken up with uplifting and clearing dark conditions around those who are in need and in prayer, those who have established a bond with their angel friends. With our mutual efforts in the light of God’s love, it is important that you are all together in harmony and in alignment with God so that we are not so drai-ned of our resources to uplift you always and to carry you in light. Rather, you have ta-ken on a personal responsibility to do so, to make that important effort to be in align-ment with God, to be in alignment with your own soul, and to allow your mental condi-tion to fade to the background of your consciousness so that you are more in prayer than you are  dealing with the material demands of life.

Yet, I realize there is much that you must do to prepare for your beloved friends and their needs. I know you wish to make this place comfortable and habitable. Although in essence, what you have is always a gift to those who come. There is no need to make things perfect, rather, a loving expression of welcome and comfort so that those who come will immediately feel the conditions and the beauty of your home and all that you have provided for their well-being. Do not cross the threshold between love and a sense of obligation and stress. Rather, allow your day to unfold in harmony and the pace that suits you and is in harmony with your own needs and well-being. With some of you, this is quite a challenge. I know you wish to put forward your best and to have for others all that you would want for yourself. But I say to you, on your Earth plane, nothing is perfect.

Indeed, your projections of their individual needs may be quite different from what they actually require. Each soul that is coming is a loving soul and is accepting and not demanding. Allow that to be the case in your minds. Do not fret over their needs, rather, do what you can in loving devotion to your beloved friends. But if that cannot be accomplished, allow it to be as it is. There is nothing here that is going to cause con-cern and difficulty amongst your friends. All will be well. All will be in harmony.What is important now is that you are in harmony and you are well so that the joy of God’s Lo-ve may bubble forth in you to welcome your guests. In this way, you start a great be-ginning. You may step into the light readily and draw in others so that they too feel the excitement, the wonderment of what is to come.

You have been all well-blessed, beloved, beloved children of God. You are all eager to do your part in the blessings of others as servants of God. Think of the many places and conditions that you have prayed in. Has the condition of the room in a material sense inhibited your prayers? Has it made difficulties for you? There could at times be the odd discomfort or inconvience, but generally, as we have followed you to many places in the world and you have gathered in many places, is it not God’s Touch, God’s blessings upon you that have dissipated any concern or discomfort? So it shall be as it has been. You will be well-provided for, beloved souls. All will be in light and harmony provided you do not allow your minds to obstruct this.

You are well aware of the duality within you and the challenges that come with this. These are times when the soul will take precedence and prayer is your purpose. When you are together in community, love is the foundation, the underpinnings of all that you do. This is not difficult considering the angels that surround you and the efforts that are being made. We ask of you to not draw away our energies and our efforts in order to uplift you from conditions you have chosen to take on, conditions that make the atmo-sphere difficult and inharmonious.

I know that you are all human, that these conditions exists within each one of you in your own unique ways. But I say to you, step forth into the light. Allow God to guide y-ou. Allow your angel friends to assist you. Walk in light, breath light, and be light for you are the examples, my friends. You are the examples to set the pace, to set the wheels in motion, to inform the beginnings of these prayers so that your friends will not be confused but will join you in this deliberate desire to be used in this way as instru-ments of God.

This will not make or take much encouragement but indeed, your stalwart presence in love, in wisdom, in light, in experience will help to clear the way. We are all beloved friends. May God bless us all in this journey. May God bring His gifts and blessings upon us. May you awaken to your gifts and all that God has blessed within you. May you be at peace, beloved souls, and walk in light and joy. This is what is meant to be, what we encourage you to accept and absorb. Do not let those small problems of the material world overshadow what you call the big picture of what you are doing.

Bless you, beloveds, bless you in His Love. Bless you in peace. Bless you in light. Bless you in truth. I am Seretta Kem. I love you all. God bless you, beloveds.
