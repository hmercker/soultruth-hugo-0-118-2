Blessings to you, beloved souls, I am Elijah. May each of you be strong, strong and upright as the winds of change encompass your world, so that you may each provide support for one another and for the truth as the world around you continues to be in the tumult of a changing Earth. May your souls rejoice in the Love of God, for it is in this Love comes the strength and the joy that is your soul flourishing. Even though the storm is all around you, so you will be upright and strong, beloved souls, so you will be lights in the world. As you go to the source of all Love, realize that the efforts that you make require that you drink of these living waters continually so that you are not waylaid or distracted by the changing conditions of your world.

You come together for a specific purpose. And I say to you, be true to yourselves and your desire to serve the light that is within your soul. God calls each of you, God knows each of you and God will utilize your gifts in ways and avenues that are not yet anticipated. As the world continues to change, so it brings opportunities and possibilities to be utilized in the calming of your world, the harmony that must come to your world. May you be at peace, beloved souls, as you journey upon this particular path. May you come to know many things, have many insights, glean much truth from this path. As God continues to awaken your soul with His Love, may you continue to invite the deep effects of this love to manifest in every part of yourself.

Do not resist these blessings, this change within you, for it is in accepting and integrating these changes that you are more able to accept and embrace the changes in the world. So you are changing and the world is changing and all is in flux, but the steadiness of God is always there. The truth of God's Love continues to be the cornerstone of your lives, and there is nothing that will change this truth nor affect your relationship with God, other than to strengthen and widen the avenue which you tread in order to be with your Heavenly Father. You will come to know many things about yourself and what you might call human nature as you see this manifest and the distress of change continues to bear upon humanity. In order to bring harmony to chaos, you must truly know your own soul and the wisdom of your soul for it is there that all solutions are found, all guidance is given, all love is imparted. It is there that you will know and be and act as God's instruments in the world.

May you allow the peace of God to rest upon you, to calm your minds, to allow yourself to go deeper into your soul awareness and truly be in harmony and in alignment with God. This you have been beseeched to do over and over again. In this we will continue to encourage you, to be forthright in your spiritual actions and efforts. The more harmony you can create for yourself, the closer is your goal to be utilized in such a unique way and manifest our presence on earth. This can be done and it is our hope that you, in your efforts and your dedications, will find your way so that you may be one who is able to be used in such a way.

Know that we are constantly with you, that we support you and uphold you. It is our wish that you uphold this mandate given to you by God, that nothing else stands in the way of your commitment, your strength, your light and the truth that you carry, the flame that is burning. May you indeed nurture this flame with your prayers and come to truly know yourselves in relationship with your Heavenly Father.

This task is not difficult nor complicated but it requires your commitment, your strength, to be upright so that the winds of change do not topple you nor your compatriots in this venture. You are each given a plethora of blessings, so rich and beautiful, that few upon your earth have been so blessed. May you come to realize and appreciate the great effort that is being made on your behalf and for your benefit so that you may walk upright and be in the light of God's Touch always.

Do not hesitate to pray, to think thoughts that are of God and love and truth. As you go about your daily business, may this be your guiding principle and efforts, for it is within the power of your thoughts, the power of your actions, the power of your prayers that you comply with what is required to prepare for these times of development which comes close. Be simple in your thinking. Do not overthink and complicate the matters of your life, but have faith that God is guiding and that all will unfold in harmony with God's Will for each of you have the capacity to know God's Will and to enact it in your lives.

May you be strong in light, may you live truth with every breath, may love flow unceasingly through you and into you. For as God's instruments, these are what come with your efforts and prayers. God will bless you mightily upon this path of light. You are His children who have gathered to walk together, to love one another, and to be blessed as you continue upon this journey of awakening, of service, of love. May His great Love pour as a great inflowing into your souls, beloveds. Beloved, beloved souls, open yourselves and know the gift of His Touch as a powerful transformative force within your being, awakened to  great truth and all else will come in its stead.

You are His children. Children who are deeply loved and blessed. Be awakened, beloved souls, allow the awakening, the leavening of your soul, to be a true part of your conscious self. Be at peace, beloveds, and know that we are with you, the angels of Love escort you upon this journey. The power of God's Touch ensures that you are protected and in the light. Allow all that is given to be absorbed and truly a part of you. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you. I am Elijah and I come to pray with you today upon the allotted hour. I come to be with you all as does my elder brother Jesus and all the bright spirits of Heaven. God bless you, beloveds.
