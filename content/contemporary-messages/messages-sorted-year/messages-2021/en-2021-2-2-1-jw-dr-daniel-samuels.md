# Encouragement to Read Messages and the Benefits Received

February 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

James Padgett Study Group, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Dr Daniel Samuels received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am here, Dr. Samuels, along with my dear brother James, who during our days on Earth, I spent much time within prayer, in the task of receiving from Jesus and the Celestials; what we received, and mostly James - who had such great rapport – are the truths of God’s Love and the truths of the spirit world. These messages included progression through the spheres, the soul, the Laws of Rapport and Communication, the Law of Attraction, the natural love, the Divine Love, and the life of Jesus. The Master communicated directly with James, as he does with brother Al.

Though these communications outside of this circle may seem ridiculous to the world or mere entertainment, I tell you with all the love in my soul there are no treasures like them on Earth. For the messages contain the great truth of God’s Love. James coming from his Christian background, myself from the Jewish tradition and being a biblical scholar, we supported each other and balanced each other. I then carried on the work when James left for the spirit world and much of what I received is also beneficial.

So, I encourage all of you who have not read the messages James Padgett received to consider doing so; to read the messages that Al Fike receives and has received, my messages, this one I speak through as well, and others’ on the Divine Love path. For each one receives in their own way, dependent upon the level of their soul in God’s Love, truth. As water rises to its own level, those who read them benefit whether they are beginning on the path or have walked this path for many years.

May all receive these great truths that hunger for them, that in turn their souls will open to the great inflowing of God’s Love and the transformation of their souls. I thank this one for allowing me to come through. I am pleased. May God bless you. I am Daniel Samuels, your brother in Christ.
