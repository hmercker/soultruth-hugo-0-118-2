Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. The floodgates are opening and many opportunities are coming to each of you to bring the Truth of God’s Love into the world. You are seeing that there is a great receptivity and positivity to your efforts, and new souls are coming to join you in this great flow of truth and light and love that is opening up the hearts and souls and minds of men and women upon your world.

Allow yourselves to be guided with each day, and eagerly anticipate what is coming with a sense of the fulfillment of God’s promise to each of you to utilise your gifts, to awaken that which is within you for the benefit of humanity. A time comes now where you will step forward in a greater pace and tempo so that each day will bring greater opportunities, new souls, eager and willing to join you upon this journey of light. Each of you feels within, a sense of purpose, a sense that God is indeed guiding you forward and that the time now is not for preparation but for action.

So, you will be called upon, beloved souls, in many ways through many avenues, to be God’s active agents in the world, part of His plan for the salvation of humanity. Be willing, beloved souls, be willing to step forward and to not shun from the limelight, for there will be many who will look upon you seeking answers, seeking guidance, seeking solace, comfort, love. As you pray each day to be used as God’s instruments, so the flow of love, wisdom, truth and light will continue to cascade through you and touch many souls. And as this is manifest, so you will feel a great deal of joy, of desire, of earnestness, to continue upon this path, walking, striving forward, doing God’s bidding. As you are used in this way, so you will feel the upliftment, the joy, the love, the blessings that come with this service.

Do not hold back, beloved souls, but eagerly anticipate what comes as a blessing with each day. With each day, new doors will open, new souls will come, and many blessings and manifestations will come your way and through you and around you, and through your brothers and sisters, and all who are joining together into a great force for light and truth and love. Be humble, beloved souls, be humble, simple in your ways, truthful in your speech, direct in your service, and at peace always, as God’s Love continues to flow into your souls and awaken you in the ways that it must in order for greater service, greater awakening, more intense action and expression as you move forward.

God bless you, my beloved friends. We are with you always. We are with you always. May God bless you and keep you in His Love. I am Seretta Kem and my love for you is great, each one. Beautiful souls, beautiful servants of God, may you continue to awaken, awaken and awaken. It is a continuous and eternal journey of the soul’s expansion and awakening, discovery of truth, greater love, greater joy. God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you.
