Peter received by Al Fike

God bless you, gracious souls. I am your friend and I come because I have been called by one soul in particular. I am Peter. I come to bring my greetings and blessings to you all, and I come from a long way; for I reside far up in the Celestial Kingdom, close to my beloved brother and Master, Jesus, whom I am his disciple and friend. I continue to work alongside my beloved brother to bring the Truth of God’s Love to all worlds, your world and all the worlds of spirit. For we are all engaged in this great effort to gather the souls of humanity and spirit into the bosom of God so that they may come to know the nurturance of God’s Great Soul and that they may come to know the peace of God's beautiful Touch. That they may come to feel within themselves the wondrous fire that is God's Love burning and glowing within them.

So I bring these wishes to you as well, each one an earnest seeker of truth, that you may indeed find your way and know the Truth of God’s Love in all Its beauty and completeness and wonderment and joy. Know that we in the Celestial Kingdom do not ignore your efforts, those desires within your prayers as we are all joined in this great flow and communion with God, awakening to His gentle Touch and knowing His powerful Truths. We are brothers and sisters all upon this journey. You, as you begin the journey of life that brings you to the awareness of your own self and the development of your own wondrous soul and mind, so that you may be that individual spark of life, beautiful light in God’s Creation. So we all move forward upon a path that leads to at-onement with God. As such we are together, traveling together in the Light of God's guidance and Breath upon us all.

May you truly know the love and peace that we know. May you truly see the Truth as we see it. And to do so, may your souls awaken to the great power of God's Love transforming and bringing you all into alignment with the Great Soul of God. We are with you my friends. Our love for you is great. But God's Love for you is ever greater. You will never know the fullness of His Love, for it is infinite. You will come to drink of the Waters of His Love again and again, your souls never sated and its thirst continues with an earnestness and a desire to find its way into the Great Soul of God, knowing the bliss and joy of this communion.

May God bless you, my beloved and beautiful friends. I am Peter, known as Peter the Rock. I continue to assist those of you who are in need of my presence and assistance as you journey forward. My love is with you. Know this, beloved souls, that my love is with you. God bless you and keep you in His Light and uplift you beloveds, uplift you in the great power and glory of His Love, the Light of His Presence washing away all that bothers and concerns your minds and bringing the true awakening and knowledge of your soul in communion with God. Blessings to you, beloved souls. Blessings to you all and to this world, uplifting and healing, bringing peace and harmony. God bless you.
