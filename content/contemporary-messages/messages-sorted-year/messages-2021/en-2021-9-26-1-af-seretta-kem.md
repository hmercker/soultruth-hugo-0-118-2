Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Seretta Kem. It's lovely to see you here tonight in prayer, your lights shining forth. Each of you has the gift of mediumship that can be expressed, not necessarily in the way that I speak to you today, but in many different ways that will allow your angel friends to work through you as channels of light and truth and love. For, we utilize all gifts that you possess in order to make this communication, this connection possible. And we are God’s instruments, are we not, as are you. So, we link the chain together so that God may bring His blessings forth through His instruments, both in the spirit world and on the material world. That instrumentality can be expressed in many different ways, and in this expression, one may confidently say that it is a form of mediumship that is utilized where we may come close, overshadow you, and use you in some way to benefit another.

Mediumship is not just one thing but a great variety and form of expression of gifts, augmented and enhanced by your angel friends who will come close. Together you form a circuit that is connected and functioning as a channel for God to bring His blessing. Bringing forth manifestations which you have come together to develop is a form of mediumship. Being a channel of healing is a form of mediumship. When you are inspired to write, you are expressing often, mediumship. When you express art, some creative venture and you are attuned to your angel friends, do you not think there is some form of communication between you in this endeavour? Much of what you can do in the world is part of your gifts of mediumship, as you become God’s instruments and channels in the world.

Consider that many avenues are open to you, especially now that you have been developed in certain ways through your time together. You have opened doors that were not opened before and you have been given enhancements and blessings and gifts that make your capacity to serve as a channel of God’s Will and blessings, deeper, wider, more profound.

You will see in the coming days, years of your life, how this opening, this unfolding of your gifts are expressed in many ways, where what is given is not truly of you but has been brought forth through you as God’s instrument. This we continue to develop within each one of you to help widen that channel, that flow, and bring forth many wondrous blessings and manifestations. This can only grow as you grow in God's Love, and so you will find yourself speaking, expressing, showing the way, and allowing the great flow of blessings through you so that others may benefit by your gifts as God’s instruments.

Much is coming for each one of you. The potentials are great, the possibilities seemingly limitless. It is for you now to choose, to accept, to allow, to be in alignment with God and allow God to work through you. We are all God’s instruments and as we become more aligned together, so the power, the beauty, the possibility and the expressions of our instrumentalities together will bring many, many blessings to this world.

And now you have friends from other planets who too, wish to work through you to bring blessings to humanity. All of this is blessed by God and will unfold in harmony and will be expressed in the beautiful Grace of God through these beautiful souls working with you and through you, for other’s benefit. The world, the universe of God is opening to you. That universe is vast and filled with a great variety of expressions of His true Self, His creative forces, Laws in action, blessings flowing through you and about you.

As you continue to open wide to this, so you will experience many surprising things, beautiful things, wondrous things, and joyful things, all in the flow of God’s Love, the expression of His great Soul giving with such bounty, such intense light and expression of love, that we are all swept into this flow, God’s desire to uplift and heal, transform and awaken His children on this Earth. You are all very gifted and you will find as you progress day by day, that these gifts will unfold, subtly at first, but in time it will become powerful and beautiful and benefit many.

May God bless you upon this journey of awakening, keep you close to Him, keep you close to all that is of Him, and allow all that God desires to flow to His children, that you may you be that conduit, that instrument, that beloved soul that God uses. For in this, you are blessed mightily and given much.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. My love is great for each of you beautiful, wondrous creations of God. God bless you.
