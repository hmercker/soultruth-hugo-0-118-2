# Blesses us and prays with us

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am Jesus, I come to be with you, beloved souls, who continue to travel forward in light, who walk the path divine with great dedication and focus, seeking the blessings of God into your souls. Seeking to be servants of God in every way and means that are possible through you. Seeking to help transform the world from darkness to light.  

I come, because you are my brethren, you are my brothers and sisters, upon this path divine and you carry the torch of truth, each of you, carry this great torch, wherever you are, wherever you go. This flame is with you, signifying that you are truly children of God, truly in alignment with your creator. May you step humbly forward and seek to serve God as he guides you so. May you be his instruments in your world. In this way we may work together, to awaken humanity from their slumbers and their errors and their darkness, to come to the light of a soul yearning for healing and freedom and awakening.  

We work together, beloved souls. We in the celestial kingdom and you upon the earthly plane, we work together that God's great plan for the salvation of humanity may be realised, that all that is meant to be manifest in this world, may indeed be manifest and all that is not meant for this world, maybe expunged and healed so that light may flourish and harmony may abound. Each of you are an essential part of this plan and you will come to meet many others, who will join you upon this road and this great effort.  

Allow yourselves to truly merge with this light, to truly be in harmony with this condition of love, so that your angle friends and all those who come to assist you may do so with ease, may truly have the outcomes and effects that are desired.

Beloved souls, we venture forth together, I am with you every step of the way. My love for you is great. I pray for you, each of you, as you continue to progress upon this path and I am one of many thousands who are praying for each of you. For it is essential that this world be uplifted in light. Those who are willing to assist God in this are precious to all of us, who also desire for the healing of your world, the upliftment of all upon it, where harmony may flourish and love may grow, where you may be truly in partnership with God to ensure the awakening of your planet, your world to harmony, vitality and light.  

Beloved souls, we are unified in these efforts, may you truly feel the power of this unity, the power of God's touch upon us all and the beauty of what unfolds with each breath and moment in prayer and collaboration in all that comes from God's deep touch upon us. Beloved brothers and sisters, we are truly together in this great venture. May His love continue to pour in abundance into your souls, uplift you, transform you and heal you, bringing great joy to your hearts, deep understandings to your mind, and love, pure and powerful love to your souls.  

God bless you, beloved souls. I come to be with you in prayer and acknowledge your efforts, your beautiful efforts to bring light, to bring love, to bring the blessings of God to your world, to yourselves. So we feast upon God's blessings and bounty for each of us, this never ending flow of love, is ours to receive for ever.  God bless you. God bless you beloveds, my love is with you all. God bless you.
