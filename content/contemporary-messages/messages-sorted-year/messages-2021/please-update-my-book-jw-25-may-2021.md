# Please update my book where it is out of date in its text

May 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here Robert J Lees. My dear friends, please do not allow the words from another time, another place to disturb your peace. Please know that I support your efforts to make whatever changes you deem necessary so as to not offend.<sup>1</sup> 

I had read Samuel Clemens, known as Mark Twain, and was familiar with that particular dialog, and I am quite sure it must have influenced my receiving. At the time, I believe that the spirits that were speaking were very much wanting to convey the equality of all souls, and how when a soul comes into spirit there is equanimity. This does not however discount souls in the lowest spheres, who may have been quite attractive or beautiful on earth by human standards, and who in the spirit world find themselves spiritually disfigured, reflecting the state of their souls. 

And yet as I received it, those souls with physical disabilities and imperfections are made whole in spirit. All souls become more beautiful as they progress through the spheres, and brighter. Darkness is used in the sense of a condition of the soul, more than any particular color. 

But I will tell you this, that in the Celestial realms and the higher spheres where the spirit body becomes such a thing of light, the colors you know on earth are completely transcended, and yet, one can retain physical characteristics as to be recognizable. The colors in spirit are shades unfathomable to the human mind, the human sight, just as celestial music is unfathomable to the human ear. And yet, some on earth can perceive these colors or shall I say a portion, just as some composers may be very influenced by the vibrations in the celestial realms so glorious! 

I hope that I have managed to clarify things, and I wish to tell you that you are dear to me. I am honored that you continue your studies, but more importantly continue your prayers. I wish you every blessing and perfect gift in the love of God. Please know I am truly your brother and friend, Robert J. Lees. God Bless you.


**Note 1** Lees is referring to a racially derogatory word used by a spirit to convey a positive point about equality in his book “Through the Mists.” This term was in use at that time (1898) but is totally unacceptable today. The pdf copy of this book available on the new-birth.net web site has been amended accordingly.
