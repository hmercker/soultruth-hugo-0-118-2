Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Keea Atta Kem. The sweet and refreshing breath of God is upon you, beloved souls, and so you have brought this beautiful blessing upon your world. Indeed, as you continue to focus upon the vitality and needs of your world to be in light and in harmony, so God's blessings may pour upon it because your prayers have opened the floodgates for such blessings. Beloveds, continue to pray for your planet, Earth, this great gift of God's creation that brings to you life, that sustains your physicality that you may indeed be in that wondrous light, that vital and beautiful light and that all that you do in the world, may you be a channel for that light and help to replenish the Earth.

May God bless you in your efforts to do so, beloved beautiful souls. I am with you in prayer as are many angels who join you in this beseeching God of His gifts and blessings of bringing much to your Earth plane that is in need of upliftment and love. God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem. I am with you in prayer. God bless you.
