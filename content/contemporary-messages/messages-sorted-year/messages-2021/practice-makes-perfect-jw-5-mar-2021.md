# Practice makes Perfect 

March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2021 

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here Clare. My dear kind mice, as they say, practice makes perfect. If you can find time, if you can find a place, to just talk to God and open your heart, this would be most helpful. For a conversation with God lifts up the soul. It is a bridge between your condition and where you wish to be in receiving the love of God. These things that help you be calm, be at peace, touch your heart, they can be most helpful. 

My sisters and I sang every day in praise, in prayer, in petition to feel the presence of God, His love. And yes, we were in a cloistered kind of way, yet we did engage with the world, and were able to bring the gifts we had received to those souls in need. Are we not all caring for others in one form or another? You cannot help another if you are not in harmony. 
   
I beseech you first and foremost, follow the longings in your heart for love, the longings in your soul to be at one with God, in His love. All else will be given to you. Once you are in this grace, you begin to see the flow, the workings of God in nature, and work of the angels, which is the work that benefits the soul. Do your souls this favor, and you will benefit all. I wish you all a healing in body, mind, and soul, that your spirit may be touched by Godâ€™s Holy Spirit. It is love, it is love. 

May God bless you and be with you and may this Grace in this circle stay with you. I love you. I am Clare, your sister and friend I Christ. Be at peace my kind mice, be in joy.
