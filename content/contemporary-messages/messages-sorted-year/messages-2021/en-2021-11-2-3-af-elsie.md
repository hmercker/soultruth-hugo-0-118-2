# Alec's Soulmate Affirms Working with Alec in the Celestial Kingdom

November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Elsie received by Al Fike

I am Alec’s soulmate and we met upon the Earth plane doing this work together. I want to encourage you, my friends, because there are many distractions and many ways you can wander off this path, finding things that are more appealing to your mind and more reassuring to a mind that is doubtful and filled with fear. I was distracted. I walked away. Though I knew God’s Love to be real and true, I found myself fearful of my gifts and the power of my gifts.

I was a medium like this instrument is a medium. I knew him on Earth and helped to nurture his gifts and his perspective. We shared a deep love bond and I am very happy that he continues upon this journey and to express his gifts boldly and with confidence. This is what it takes sometimes to walk this path because as my dear Alec says, you will attract criticism and detractors that which you engage within and express on this path. Remember, the love is the power that upholds. Love from God is the greatest power of all. May you continue to find the nurturing of your soul by receiving His great gift of Love. In this way you will be strong enough, brave enough, clear enough, confident enough to walk in the Light of God’s Love.

My love is with you all. I observe you from this place of heaven where I have progressed into the Celestial Spheres. I’m happy to be with my beautiful soulmate, Alec, and to be with you today in this Circle of Prayer. How different from the circles I attended, but yet, the foundation is the same, the truth is the same, and your yearning souls are the same. May you come to know God, His great Light burning within you and surrounding you in Love.

God bless you. I am Elsie and I am with you in your efforts. My love is with you, and my understanding of your struggles. I understand and I am here to help, to assist you and to uphold you, especially my dear and beloved daughter that I love so dearly. I am with you. I am with you beloved, beloved daughter. God bless you. God bless you all.
