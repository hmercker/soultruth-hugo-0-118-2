# The world needs God's Love to survive coming changes

October 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Matthew received by Al Fike

I know many of you cannot see nor do you recognize the amount and depth of support and love that is given to you and given to this world. God’s Hand rests upon this world. His angels are ministering to this world as God’s instruments. You have come to know other possibilities and resources that are set forth to assist this world as it continues to evolve and transform.

Change is a constant in the universe, my beloved friends. Change is a constant in your world. It is not just the actions of man that are of deep concern. It is the effects and power of transformation that this world is undergoing at this time that is of great concern. Man has great ingenuity and ability to combat those forces that are contrary to the life and will of man. Yet, even the resources and gifts of man cannot fully neutralize the forces that are in play at this time that will change the face of this Earth and change the way that all souls dwell upon it.

What is needed is faith, a faith that God’s plan will be implemented and through God’s Love and mercy for all His children, there will be opportunities and blessings for all so as to mitigate the changing conditions and effects of those conditions upon  individuals’ lives.
Your greatest tool and power lie within love, to continue to grow in your love of God and God’s Love for you, to continue to seek the high road, and to live in harmony with God’s Laws. It is your example, beloved souls, that will hit its mark in time. Those who you see are not aware and cannot see what is coming, will come to understand through your instrumentality and example and love.

In this way, you open a great door for your families and loved ones. In this way, you become God’s agent to assist all in adjusting to the changes that are taking place and will continue to take place for a number of years to come. It is not that all will crumble and be transformed in a moment. As with anything in God’s universe, changes will come in waves and in certain timing that will be in harmony with His laws in order to bring harmony.

So, I would urge you not to be worried or fully proactive in preparing for your children, your loved ones for the times to come for what is coming is very different from what you imagine now. What is coming is a great blessing upon humanity. That time will come when the choice to follow the Will of God and to acclimatize to the new conditions that are being set upon the Earth or to resist and be independent from God’s Will and that relationship with God that will bring greater harmony to all, this is the choice that all will make.

If you are to prepare your children and loved ones, I suggest that you tell them that a choice is coming, that how humanity lives now is not in harmony with God’s creation, and that indeed God will give every individual the choice to step away from those conditions that are not in harmony, those patterns and outcomes that are a part of the human will and not entirely a part of God’s Will. To be able to step away, to release the fear and desire and all that comes with the willful efforts of humanity is a great challenge for each individual. To seek God’s Love and blessings, to be in alignment with God, is what you are all doing at this moment and in your daily lives.

In these efforts, your prayers and recalibrations of thought and action, so you find yourself to be more in harmony with God. Has this been so very difficult, beloved souls? Or has it been a great blessing with each step? Though certainly, you have adjusted somewhat to a new attitude, a new way of expressing yourself in the world, a new way of coming to God. But as you have made your steps and adjustments, have you not felt uplifted? Have not felt that God is truly blessing you?

So, you may share this with your loved ones. Your dedication and countenance and simple words and loving expressions will all assure them that they are loved by God. Although certainly, within the minds of many, there will be skepticism and resistance. But it is not just the minds that are listening, it is the soul that listens as well. When the soul hears these words, and comes to know your reassurance and your love, you bring a spark, a spark of truth that God may indeed invigorate and make more powerful and it will grow within their souls.

When the time is right and the conditions impinge upon humanity to such a degree that they are challenged with each day, then the spark of truth, this utterance of reassurance will come to consciousness. They will come to see that God truly does love them, and that what is taking place in the world is a blessing from God to neutralize and heal the damage that has been wrought by humanity.

The eyes must be opened, my friends, the eyes of truth in you and in all in the world, with a true desire to change, to bring harmony to their lives, to their hearts and their souls and their minds. This is done with love for love is the great lever, the vehicle for change. Love is what must manifest in your world. If change is to be integrated and accepted by humanity, it is because they have accepted love within their hearts, love for one another, love for themselves, and love for God.

All these levels of love, aspects of love, manifestations of love must come forth through humanity in order for humanity to truly find its place in a new world, in a world that requires a great shift, an expression of the true desire of the soul, a recalibration of thought and action. These things will come with love and so love must be the message, love must be the currency, love must be the truth that you share with your brothers and sisters. As you love, so love will resonate through the world. As you touch another soul and they in turn come into alignment with love, so the light will grow and the harmony will come.

May you all find your place within the great flow of God’s Will, His great plan for the salvation of humanity. May you come to pray for His Love to transform you more fully with each day. May you come to accept that transformation and make it truly a part of yourself so that you may live and act in harmony with the Laws of Love.

Beloved souls, you know the key. You have the key. May you truly be in alignment with this wonderful truth. May God bless you with every breath.

My love is with you. I am Matthew. My love is with you all. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
