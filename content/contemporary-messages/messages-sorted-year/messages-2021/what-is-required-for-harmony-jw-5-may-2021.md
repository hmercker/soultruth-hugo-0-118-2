It is I, Charles. My dear friends on this path of Divine love. You who drawn to the creative arts in song and dance in theatre and beyond, there is much healing to be had. 

What is required is to be in harmony in the human condition and to be lifted in the love of God as you desire. What kind of dance would that be? What kind of song would be sung? This you know. Your soul will inform you and it will always be graceful, joyful, uplifting and often humorous. For to put a smile in heart is a great gift. To lift the soul form despair and darkness to hope and faith and trust is a great work. You can never give enough. And in this secular world so bereft of true joy, there is much give, much you can co-create with us. 

We are here for you, and you have my love and support and the encouragement and help of many, many, blessed souls. Go in joy and peace and love. God bless you. I am your brother and friend Charles.
