Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloveds. I am Seretta Kem. The world is beginning to awaken to the fact that the Earth is changing. They see dimly into the future and realize that because of climatic conditions and other conditions within the world, that the stability and control that they wish to achieve as a race, as a culture, as a society, as an economy, etcetera, is slowly becoming destabilized. And indeed, there is more coming that is not seen nor anticipated. They see the power of their own will and doing in the world, but they cannot see the power of God’s Will and doing in the world. And so, they only see one small portion amongst the entire picture that is the ongoing evolution and change that is coming.

We will assist you in seeing more, beloved souls, but we are not doing so, so that you will raise the alarm bells and worry about your future and the future of your loved ones. Rather, we wish to do so in order to inform you of your immediate future and how you may prepare yourselves accordingly. This guidance will be given to each individual, and as is the case with mortals, they have a tendency to interpret and see this information differently. So, I urge you to compare your insights with one another, because between you, you will come to a greater and more detailed realization of what has been given.

You continue to progress in the efforts of Direct Voice. You are being well tested at this time and I know you are aware of this. Each week brings its own challenges and its own insights. You will find that this will continue for quite some time. We cannot implant the learning within you. It must be a process which you go through individually with your eyes open, your minds open, your hearts open, so there may be deeper integration of knowledge and wisdom, of truth, that you may release all those conditions that are not in harmony with love. You are still very human, my beloved, beautiful friends. But each of you has burning within you that bright and beautiful light of love and this will inform your journey for all of eternity. It will continue to grow and have profound effects upon your consciousness, your thinking, your doing in the world. Gifts will emerge and come forward in surprising ways, in unanticipated ways. Love will flow, flowing through you  profoundly and deeply. This love will be your foundation. It will influence everything you do, everything that you think and everything that you are. This powerful blessing, the Essence of God, is capable of changing you, and once it has changed you and a number of others, it will change the world.

So, I urge you to carry on in your prayers, your contemplations, your ruminations, all those things that bring you to a greater consciousness. Because the time grows short, my beloved and beautiful friends, the time grows short. I urge you to utilize this time and see each day, each moment, as precious and full of promise. You are becoming truly God’s children. You will continue to awaken to this fact and come to realize the great benefits and blessings that come in knowing your Holy Father, in knowing who you are, knowing your own soul. These things are the foundation of your life and will direct your progress forward. God bless you beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem and I love you all. God bless you.
