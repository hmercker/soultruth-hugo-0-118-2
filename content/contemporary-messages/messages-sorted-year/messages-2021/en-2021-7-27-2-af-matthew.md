Matthew received by Al Fike

God bless you, precious and beloved souls, I am Matthew. The power of prayer is the great lever that opens the door to God. How very crucial it is to express your thoughts and desires to your Creator. And the deeper you go within yourselves to find and acknowledge these desires so that they are truly emerging from your soul, so you give power to your relationship with your Creator. You empower your consciousness to be aware, to know the Presence of God. One may do many things in life, for God has given you many abilities to do what you may do in the material plane. But what animates the body? What animates life? It is the Touch of God.

So each of you, when you go beyond those material thoughts and desires and reach deep within yourself to your soul, so you acknowledge the very truth of life, the very core of your existence, which lay within your relationship with your Creator. To beseech your Creator to touch your soul, to bring His Blessings forth flowing unrestricted within. To infill you and infill the room in which you are now present, infill this Circle which you create together, infill this world in which you live, beseeching God to touch all aspects of your life, opening your soul to His Great Love, seeking His intervention in your thoughts, in your physical being, in all things of your life.

The power of prayer may open the possibilities of these blessings. Do you know and truly understand the power of prayer? Do you utilize this gift at every turn in your life? Do you make great effort to open that door between you and God so that much Light can flow?  Godâ€™s resources are limitless. Asking for His Blessings does not diminish God. Asking to be uplifted, to be guided, to be awakened, does not diminish God, but it does bring forth greater Light and life into your lives. For as you well know, you have free will and so you must choose, so you must walk in the Light, in accordance to your choice and your thoughts and your desires.

Walk with us in the Celestial Kingdom. Walk in the light and all that is good and wondrous, all that is bright and beautiful, all that is of life and love and harmony, love and joy will be yours. God will not withhold from His children. This loving Father Who created you will bring to you all that you require to be in the Light, to live a life in harmony with His Laws of Love. These things are given freely. It is for you to ask, to accept, to be receptive and to have faith that God indeed will Touch your soul, your being, in Light and Love. So it is and so it will always be. For upon this journey that is ignited with His Gift of Love within your soul, this Flow from God, it will be eternal and will be limitless in its qualities and quantity, to touch and redeem, replenish and remake your soul. These things, these gifts, these blessings, are here at this moment. It is for you to draw this to yourself, to walk in this Light, to truly make great effort to be in the Light for every breath and moment of your lives, so that you may come to know the great joy of a soul redeemed and transformed by the Grace of God's Love.

God bless you, beloveds, I am Matthew. My love is with you. My prayers are with you and many pray with you, for the world is in need of your prayers. The world is in great need. May you continue to minister to all that is in darkness, so to assist God to bring them into Light and bring all this world into harmony. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you deeply, deeply within your souls. Feel the inflowing, know it, acknowledge it; it is a Gift from God. God bless you.
