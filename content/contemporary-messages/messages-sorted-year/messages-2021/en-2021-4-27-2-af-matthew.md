Matthew received by Al Fike

God bless you, I am Matthew. The breath of God is upon each of you. Beloved souls. open yourselves to God’s Touch, His loving ministrations upon your souls. Put aside your mindful thoughts and concerns. Allow God to enwrap you in this blanket of Love, taking away all that is stressful and difficult knowing at this moment that God uplifts you into His Light and presence, that we are all together in God’s grace, that He is forever with us in His Love. He nurtures us with every breath that we take. He wishes to give us greater life within our souls, awakening us to all that we are, the great kernels of gifts and blessings, yearning, seeking to be awakened and to come alive in His blessed Touch. Together we are in this Light, together may we breathe in His Love, together may we feel the unity and grace, peace and joy that is this place of the soul in communion with God.

May God bless you, beloved souls, upon your journey of light, of love, of truth, awakening all within you, bringing you into that great at-onement with God. Together we pray, together we are children of God.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Matthew and I come to pray with you all, as do many angels who walk with you and pray with you and seek to serve God through you and upon you, blessings of Love. God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you.
