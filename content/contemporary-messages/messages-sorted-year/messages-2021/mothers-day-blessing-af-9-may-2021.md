God bless you beloved souls. I come, I am Jesus and I come to bless you all as God's blessings rain down upon you, beloveds. A multiplicity of blessings for you and for this world, as God continues to use His channels and opportunities to touch the souls of humanity upon this world. So you open the floodgates through your prayers, a rainbow hue of Light flowing down upon your Earth and all you pray for; the beautiful souls who are in need of your blessings, the blessings of God, the blessings of your prayers. 

Open your souls wide, each one of you, open your souls wide to the infilling of God's Love. For this is the moment where you may receive abundantly, as you pray together in this way and as we gather you into the Light, into this great Circle of Light. May you be receptive, putting aside all conditions of the material plane and opening yourselves to that true place of knowing God. We are with you in that place of Light. We walk with you as you seek God, so we are all enraptured in His Blessing of Love. 

Awaken beloveds, and know the peace that passes all understanding. Be in communion and allow all that is meant to be, to be within your person, your great soul attuned to God. In this peace you will know and feel the power of God's Love for you, the awakening of all those parts of you that have slumbered for so long and yet awaits your reaching to the Source of All so that they may be awakened, fulfilled in love and in joy.

Come with me my children, and we shall know God together and all the glory that is His Light and Love, all the wonderment that is His Creation, all the joy that is part of a life lived in relationship with one's Creator. Awaken beloveds, awaken to your true self and be blessed mightily. His Presence is with us. His Holy Spirit touches us. We are in that place so desired by many and yet often they are not reachable because the mind inhibits the soul. Put aside your mindful things, beloveds, and be with your soul at these moments, in this purity, so all that is for you will be given in great abundance.

God bless you. I am your brother; I walk with you. I am Jesus. We pray together in His Grace, beloveds. God bless you.
