# I urge you to pray for God's plan

November 5<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

God bless you dear ones, I am your friend Mylora. I come to pray with you, to pray for the forest and the waters and the oceans, to pray for the air that you breath, to pray for all of God's creation that is this world of ours. For as you pray do you not feel  within your heart your love for this world, an appreciation for all that God has created, a desire that all of these creations, all of these aspects of your world may be protected and clean and pure as they are intended. I know this is a dilemma for you all, to live in the world but yet not have such an impact upon the world that it suffers by your presence. And yet because of your culture and societies and way of life, you cannot help but have this effect.

You know, however, that God has a plan that will neutralize these effects of the human condition, will come to bring harmony back to the world. So I urge you to pray for God's plan as well and that you may find your place within it. Most of all, I urge you to pray to receive the great blessing of His Love, for in that blessing, that kernel of light that you build within yourself are the answers that you seek, the way forward to bring harmony to the world.

May you find your way upon what is a confusing and difficult time towards harmony in your world. May you be inspired by God's touch. May your angel friends always be by your side that you may in walk in light, beloved, beloved souls. Walk in the light of love. See with the eyes of love. Be a channel of love. And all those conditions that are not of love, may you not be affected by them. May you release what is within you. May you see your brothers and sisters, those close to you, your families and loved ones, with eyes of love for this is the beginning of change, to see the world in love, to walk in the world in love, to be God's channel of love. As you continue to grow in love, so you will feel and know the presence of your angel friends and God's touch upon you to such an extent that you will not know or express or have thoughts other than that which is of love. It comes with power, this gift from God, to change you and to change the world.

Walk this path, beloveds, walk this path of love. Do not despair of all of those things that are in need of healing and harmony, rather put love before you, put love behind you, put love all around you and you will find solutions will come. The guidance that you ask for will be yours, given freely, and love will grow and blossom within you, beloved, beloved souls.

My love is with you, I am Mylora. And so we shall pray for the world together and pray for each other, for all whom you love, that God may touch us all in these moments. God bless you, God bless you and be with you now in love.
