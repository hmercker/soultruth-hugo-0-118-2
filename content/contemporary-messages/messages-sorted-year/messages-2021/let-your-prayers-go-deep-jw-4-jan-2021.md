I am here, Israel ben Eliezer. You may know me as the Baal - Baal Shem Tov.  My dear brothers and sisters who come together in the Love of God - each one’s heart requiring the tender embrace that is the love Divine. Some come in pain seeking the balm that heals the heart, that soothes the soul and the body. 

I encourage you to let your prayers to God go deep. Allow your heart to open that God may fill it with love and touch your soul. That no matter what condition you came to this circle in, you can leave in joy and in the light and in the glow of the gift of the Creator. This love is eternal. This love will carry you across the ocean to the shores of eternity in the Celestial heavens. I speak from experience. 

In my time we danced, and we prayed, and we celebrated. We felt the fire, the glow of God’s love, whether in times of poverty or abundance as we had the wealth of the Heavenly Father’s love. 

This place of light where every soul is transformed, lifted, and awakened is a precious place indeed. This is why you have what you have and maybe you do not know the words to explain and it does not matter. What matters is that you have arrived at the doorway to the Kingdom with the keys of prayer, the longings of your souls, to which God responds opening the door of His soul and touching each one of you with Grace. If even for a moment you can be lifted up above your concerns, all the troubles, trials and tribulations of this world in the balm of His love, in the Joy, then you know you are on your Way to a Divine destination. 

So with all my blessings for the New Year on earth and the light of God’s Love that will transform all; May it be yours. May it be yours. I am your brother and friend in the Love of God. I am Baal Shem Tov. May God bless you!
