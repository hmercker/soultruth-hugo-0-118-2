Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloveds, I am Mylora. The light from Godâ€™s great Soul is reaching you, beloveds. It drifts upon these beams of light that touch each one of you and uplifts you in light.

May you come to feel His gentle touch, His breath upon you, and know the thrill of the soul that comes when God is there and reaches out to uplift you in light, to bring the essence of His Soul into your soul and make you truly one of His own. You are His child, beloved and beautiful. You are of Light, pure and divine. May you come to see yourselves in this way and know yourselves as truly His child divine and be that beautiful and wondrous soul that you are in the great journey to at-onement with God. You are His creature, you are His child, you are all the hopes and dreams of God put into a being with a soul. These great potentials that you know very little of will come to be realized as you walk ever closer to this light of love. And so you will see for yourself the wonderment that God has created. So you will express in the world a pure and beautiful light filled with wisdom and love so that your brothers and sisters may come close and feel this warmth, this embrace that is God working through you to uplift His children and to bring greater light into the world. You are His children. We are His children together, and we carry this lantern of light within us. It glows never ending, never ceasing, and always growing ever brighter in the world.

Blessed are God's children, blessed indeed as you walk in the light and seek to know His true self through your true self. May God bless you on this journey, beloved souls. I am Mylora and I love you dearly and am with you often as you pray to bring greater light to yourselves and to this world, to your loved ones, and all that you know are in need of a blessing. So I am with you and many others, as you know, are with you. You are never alone. We are ever present to help uplift and guide and protect, to inspire, and to pray with you as you seek God's blessings. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. God bless you.
