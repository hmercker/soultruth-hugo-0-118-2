Confucius received by Al Fike

We love you, beloveds, we love you dearly, precious souls upon your world, a world so in need of God's Touch and healing and upliftment. So you beseech God's blessings upon you all. All are blessed at this moment, all you have prayed for are being blessed at this moment, the great gift of God's Touch upon your beloveds, upon this world, upon all who seek the blessing of God. It comes in waves of light, beautiful light, waves of peace, peace beyond understanding, waves of love that envelop and touch each soul with the grace of God’s great soul upon them, awakening the beauty that lies within, the bud coming to flower, the wondrous gifts of the soul coming to fruition, the beautiful grace that is the soul awakened.

We cherish you all, beloveds, we cherish you all, for you are children of God as are we. Together we are family, family of love, family of joy, family of God's Creation. Beloved souls, know that we pray with you and that all those who you pray for are being blessed. The power of your prayers, beloveds, the power of your prayers brings a mighty flow of love and light and healing to those who are in need, and to yourselves. For we know how difficult it is to live in this darkened world, and yet you insist upon the light, you invoke the light with every prayer, with every desire that is true and sincere. So you ask God to uplift you in light and so God responds with His Love and blessings upon you.

You are truly blessed, you are truly blessed in your world, a world that is starving for love, starving for light, starving for peace. You have before you a bountiful table of God's blessings where you are free to pick what you desire, to have what you need to fulfill your thirst and your hunger for love, for light, and all that is good and of God. So God places His bounty before you, beloveds, this bounty so rich, this bounty that infills you with such pleasure and gratitude and joy. Drink deep, beloveds, consume the gifts of God, for they are limitless and there is no restriction to you who seek and you who come to the table of God’s Love. So we encourage you to pray earnestly, to seek diligently, to be in harmony with God.

So we are together in this pursuit and so we shall always be, for all eternity, together, God's children in the light of His Love. Blessings to you, beloved souls, blessings of healing, of peace and love. Light pouring, pouring upon each of you, light pouring upon your world, light pouring upon all who seek it. Beloveds, you are loved, deeply, deeply loved. My love is with you. The love of your angel friends surrounds you, and the Love of God through His great Holy Spirit is touching you at this moment. Open your souls wide and drink deep the living waters of Love. God bless you. God bless you. You are uplifted, uplifted greatly in His Light.

Peace, peace, beloveds.
