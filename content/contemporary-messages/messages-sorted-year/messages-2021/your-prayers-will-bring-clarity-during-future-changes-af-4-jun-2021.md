# Your Prayers Will Bring Clarity During Future Changes

It is good that you pray for the great blessings of light and love for your world. Your prayers can benefit your world, the physical world and the spiritual world which is all around you, uplifting these conditions, uplifting your brothers and sisters, uplifting all that is upon this world. God will use those of you who desire to be a channel for these blessings, that they may reach out and pour forth into your world, cascading light,  healing, blessings and love. God will pour His vital creative forces upon the Earth to help heal those conditions which continue to degrade the Earth. None of you are immune nor are you removed from this condition that destabilizes your Earthly plane for you are all enmeshed in the material wants and needs that come as you live your life. In time there will be changes within your Earthly plane that will bring its healing and balance back to what you call “Mother Earth.” It is our hope that each of you will come to see and comply with what will be asked of you as children of the Earth to be in greater harmony with your existence upon this world.  

There is much to be done, and we have told you this many times and at this time we urge you to continue to pray and receive the great blessing of the Father’s Love. And in so doing, you will gain greater insight and understanding of what is required of you, what is required of humanity to offset the conditions and expressions of your brothers and sisters who are very much a part of the Earthly conditions and the human condition. We will guide you accordingly, and God will guide you upon a journey of healing, not only for yourselves but to heal all around you and to contribute to the great healing forces that are coming to your world. Yes, great shifts, adjustments and challenges are coming to every soul upon your world. May you be strong enough and bright enough and aligned enough with God in His love that you will be able to move forward and see clearly that which must be undertaken in order to contribute to the healing of your world and the healing of yourself.  

Truth will come in many ways. Truth will come to help you understand, to help you to strengthen you and to bring you into greater alignment with all which is in harmony with God’s love and God’s creation. I know it is difficult to see through this Earthly condition, through your mindful and material thoughts and perceptions of life. Indeed God is transforming you within your soul as you continue to receive His great blessing of love, drop by drop. It is bringing to you deeper insights and greater understanding and great compassion so that you may walk in the world as an example of what is meant to be, what you and all souls are meant to be upon this world. 

You are all somewhat naïve as to how you may contribute and often you do not see how you contribute that which is disharmonious in the world. But this insight will come, and you will come to know from that deep place within you what God has created and to see your part and the expression of yourself within His laws of Creation. It must come with humility, with a desire to push aside the scales upon your eyes and to be in harmony with all that is of light, with all that can bring joy and healing, balance and truth, love and wisdom to your world. You are meant to come to realize and to express these things for this is inevitable when you infill your soul through prayer asking God to bless you with His love. All things come to those souls who seek light and there are many at this time who seek light and seek to bring healing and grace to your world. You will all be guided, truly guided upon this path, upon and through and within God’s plan for the salvation of humanity and for this world. Strengthen yourselves, beloved souls. Seek greater portions of the Essence of God to reside within your souls and you will find your way in great service, discover those gifts that you so long to express and be a light in the world. God bless you, my friends. I am Keea-Atta Kem. My love is with you. We pray together with many souls in spirit, from the Celestial Kingdom and you upon the Earth plane, a great force of light to bring the changes that are required, to bring the healing that is meant to be, to bring the love that uplift your souls. God bless you. God bless you. My love is with you.
