Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

My love is with you today, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. The light is evident in your loving care for one another and your desire to be with your Creator. It is in this purity, the strength of your desires, the willingness that is in your hearts, and the longing within your souls which bring you to this place of light and harmony. May these conditions continue to intensify so that the light is brighter, the love is stronger, the unity is greater.

Each of you bring many gifts. Some, you do not realize that you bring. But in this Circle of Light, you are bringing all of yourselves into it. You are present with it. You are in alignment with God. It is in this way with an open heart and a true soul desire and an open mind that we are able to do our work together for you more reflect the Celestial conditions in this way.

Do you not feel the innocence within you though it often feels vulnerable? It is a powerful state of readiness for the blessings of God to be upon you. As you truly see one another, understand the vulnerabilities and the fears and the errant thoughts, do you not see yourselves in your beloved friends? Do you not see that the human condition so pervasive in your world still affects much of your thoughts? We in the Celestial Kingdom work diligently to neutralize these conditions around you so that you are able to reach beyond this earthly plane to those places of light and joy and love.

As you reach out to God, we reach with you and together we are within this Light that is God’s Presence. We are all open to the inflowing of His great Essence, which transforms us, and awakens us. Beloved and beautiful souls, we are joyed by your light and your longing. In this, we are all able to be closer to God. May you carry this condition for all of your lives. This place of wonder, of joy, of openness and love where the words of your soul reach your mind and bring its wisdom and the knowing of your soul communing with God brings joy to your heart and the flutter of God’s Holy Spirit upon you as God breaths in His Love, that warmth, the beautiful gift that says to you *“all is well and all that you are is loved”.*

God bless you, my friends. Drink in His Loving Waters. Drink in His blessings. So, we will continue upon this journey together. God bless you, beloved friends. Know that the love of the angels surrounds you and the Love of God enters into you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
