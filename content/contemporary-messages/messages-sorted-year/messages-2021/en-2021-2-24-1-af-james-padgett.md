I will be brief but I wish to acknowledge and thank you all for your efforts, to continue to make the efforts of the angels part of the earth plane consciousness. That these documents will be sustained and shared for many years to come and are an important body of work which has required a great deal of effort from the angels to bring them through and a great dedication from this instrument and from you in order to document these messages. It is important that you continue to commit yourself to this process and to realize how vital it is to continue to bring these messages forward to the world.

When I played my part so many years ago, I did not realize the value and importance of what was given through me. Now that I am in spirit in the Celestial Kingdom, I see that indeed this was a great breakthrough. One that had been anticipated for centuries and tried as the angels did to utilize various instruments in order to bring through this information, these truths but unsuccessfully until they came upon myself. Even though I was somewhat reluctant and skeptical they were able to connect and to use me as an instrument, a medium. Such was not the case with this instrument for he began this journey many years ago as a young man and has come to accept and value these communications from the angles. In this way there are no barriers present, no doubts, merely a willingness and this is ideal for we in the Celestial Kingdom to come through. For his soul is filled with the Fatherâ€™s Love, his mind is open, he is willing to spend the time and dedicate his efforts towards these truths and as such he represents a valuable resource, one that needs support and love and it is my wish that you will continue to support these efforts, for it is a chain of love is it not? A chain of desire and dedication to the truth. Each of you are linked within that chain and as such are valuable links and in times to come you will see for yourself how important this work is and will benefit personally from these efforts as God blesses you while you move forward in love.

I have said my peace beloved souls. I thank you for listening to me and I wish you well as you continue to work together. Know that we are close and that God blesses your efforts. God bless you. I am James Padgett. My love and my commitment to you is there always. God bless you. God bless you beloveds.
