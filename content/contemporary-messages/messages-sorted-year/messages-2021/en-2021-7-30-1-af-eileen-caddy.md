# Calls Us All to Serve God

July 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Eileen Caddy received by Al Fike

And I come because my dear friend (J) is with us in your circle. I come because I too benefit from the blessings of God's Love in my soul. I continue to make my journey to at-onement with God. I come because I want you all to know that you each have the capacity to touch many souls as I once did upon the earth. This grandmotherly figure that I was came with God's blessings and Touch that I channeled through my soul to many. So can you, beloved souls, so can you be that light in the world. Be a beautiful light, a light that will bring wisdom and upliftment and inspiration to many. It is not difficult. It merely requires some faith and some trust in God, and God will do the rest.

God will surely do the rest. He will give to you all that you require to be a true channel of love in the world. Indeed, it is not difficult nor will the barriers hold you back, only those within your mind, and your mind certainly is a challenge, as it was for me. Indeed, I could see and feel and touch the grace of God in my life and this strengthened me and helped me to release those things that inhibited my gifts and my efforts and ministries in the world. It does not take much, but it does take a desire and dedication to serve God. Each of you in your souls know this, each of you in your souls are beautiful in light and know the great touch of God's Love upon it.

You have a great message to give, you have wondrous gifts that can be shared for the benefit of many. Allow yourselves to be used by God and I say to you that you too will be known in the world. You too will have your impact and effects for the benefit of many. And you too may someday start a center of light in the world through your efforts and your wisdom and all the blessings that may come through you. These centers of light are so needed in your world, sanctuaries and places of refuge for those who are weary of the world, those who are seeking comfort and peace and truth.

Would you not want to be a part of something that would bring to people such gifts and blessings? All you need to do is pray and God will inspire you, God will guide you and send you forward upon your missions. God has a plan for every soul. May you come to find that plan and be a true adherer of His Will and plan. Beloved and beautiful souls, may your prayers continue and may your desires be strengthened and grow into a mighty flow of light and love. It takes but prayer and faith, courage and desire, and all will follow in the stead of God's Will.

God bless you, beloved, beloved souls. I am so happy to speak with you today. Yes, I am high up in the world of spirit, close to the Celestial Heavens, and I will be entering those gates very quickly.

I am joyed with the prospects. I am happy to come to speak to you today and to be in that great flow of love which is God's Touch upon us all in these moments of prayer. I thank you for listening to me and I too will pray for you all. God bless you, God bless you. I love you all, beautiful lights in the world. God bless you.
