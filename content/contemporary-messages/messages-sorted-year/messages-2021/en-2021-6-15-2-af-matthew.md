Matthew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Matthew. The world of man is a world filled with deception and error. The world that you have built, the reality that humanity has built for itself through its mindful assertions and deductions, is not necessarily in alignment with God's world and what God has created. So, the willfulness of man has created a schism between himself and God, and it is difficult for many of you upon the earth plane to mend that schism and bring the reality of God within your hearts and your minds and your souls. But indeed, that struggle must be a daily pursuit and effort to release error and to adopt truth; not that truth that comes to you through logical deduction or even that which comes from the five senses, where you are well-versed in these things.

But the truth of the soul comes in a different way, it comes from the soul awakened. It comes from perceptions which grow and come to life within your soul as you continue to receive the great blessing of Divine Love. Indeed, some of you easily accept the truth that comes in this way, for you often have experiences and insights that confirm the truth of your soul, but for many it is a struggle. For, you are so well entrenched within the human condition and that which is of the mind, that to trust anything other than this is difficult indeed. Your mind resists, and powerfully so. Your thoughts are in alignment with the current of thoughts that surround your earth plane and are constantly reinforced by your brothers and sisters.

You have been told to mistrust your feelings and those things deeper than the intellect, for they often contradict the thoughts of men and the deductions that come with those thoughts. So, as you walk in the world and entertain both realities, there is inevitable conflict and the sense of not being truly aligned with either. Thus, the struggle is great. The need for validation, for understanding, rises up within your mind constantly, and the mind continues to hold sway upon your thinking and your perceptions.

We have spoken of this many times and we have great compassion for you all, for when that time comes when you are released from the physical, these perceptions and awarenesses and experiences of the soul will become more readily available to your conscious self, for it will not be so heavily influenced by the currents of thought upon your world. But you are upon this world, beloved souls, and so your struggles continue. At times you have great joy and fulfillment and appreciation that comes with a soul experiencing God and experiencing the truth of God’s Creation, and other times you are within the quagmire of dark conditions of this world. But know that we are always there to lift you up. God is always eager to attend to you spiritually and to bring Light and Love to your soul.

No matter what condition you may carry, what struggles you may have, what error may be within you, know that in time, God will heal all of these things, that you may have the strength, the faith, the willingness, the eagerness, to be in alignment with God, to be in alignment with your own soul and release those things that are not in harmony with this. For, much comes to the penitent soul, to the one who seeks truth and seeks God. 
Though you may have trouble sharing with your brothers and sisters that which you know and have experienced in your prayers and your efforts reaching God, for at times it defies explanation, but I tell you, beloved the souls, when you are in the Light of God's Presence and you seek as a child would seek in all innocence to be with God, then oh! what God has to give to each one of you. Oh! the wonders and wonderments of God’s Blessings upon you.

There is so much that can come when the dominance of the mind is acquiesced and put aside, if but for a few moments, and you come to God in this innocent way. The power of innocence, the power of desire, the power of prayer combined to bring you to God, will heal all obstructions between yourselves and your Creator. You have your angel friends by your side. You know this powerful truth, that in its beautiful capacities will in time wipe away all untruth, all that is error and all that is of pain.

May you continue to be persistent and consistent in your prayers and in this way, all will unfold in God's good time, in grace and harmony, and there will be peace for each of you, deep and abiding peace that will overcome all your struggles, tragedies, painful experiences in life, and bring joy in its stead.

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Matthew. I pray with you now as we pray to God to continue transforming our souls and awakening us to Truth. God bless you, beloved souls, my love is with you all. God bless you.
