# Be True to Your Souls in this Unique Venture

January 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

Matthew received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Matthew.

As you progress in these ventures, it is important that you ask these questions: *how is this in alignment with God's Will? How might I serve God through my gifts and capacities to express the light within my soul? How is this in alignment with the Laws of Love? How might I express the truth through my words and abilities and the abilities and words of my colleagues?* The focus must be upon God not upon the perfect and most eloquent set of ideas put forward, for these things will surely come as one's alignment with God is increased and intensified with the gift of the Father's Love. Then progress becomes easily attained, then the words flow without great effort or analysis, and the road forward is seen and understood.

You have committed yourselves to showing the way of the soul. And I ask you, beloveds, are you in alignment with this intention at all times? It is one thing to have a mindful commitment, an idea to establish this alignment and to express these things but in essence the first and foremost aspect and goal of your work is to be in alignment with God always, so to know His Will and express His Will through you. And that is not easily attained, does not come readily for those of you on the Earth plane and therefore you have a mixture of mindful intentions and goals that are not of the soul. Indeed, it is easy for you to engage one another in intellectual analysis and mindful intentions. And this we must adjust to in our efforts with you because in our reality, our existence, the material mind does not exist, the ways of the material mind are not relevant. We are attuned to the minds of our souls and that process, that way of expression and coming to outcomes is very different indeed.

And so we challenge you, beloved souls, to go deep within yourselves. Put aside the many words and points, edicts and ideas. Ask God to put within you the vision, the truth of His Will in clarity, in grace and joy, so that all will be infused with love, all will be a reflection of the love within your soul. When this alignment is attained, then the questions that you ask, the efforts that you make, the explorations that you have will be clear, powerful, unambiguous and within the realms of truth, truth of the soul.

I encourage you forward, and I know that each of you have a deep intention to be in alignment with God, to do God's Will and God's work. And so you will be, but how much effort and time must be applied in order to achieve these goals is determined by your own faith, the workings of your soul, and the acknowledgment of those workings within you, utilizing the gifts that each of you carry, utilizing the wisdom that is within each of you, and putting them forth into your mind's eye in a way that is clear and simple, yet powerful and effective.

As you continue in this process, as you continue to speak together, analyze and pray and hope for all outcomes to be in harmony with God, I say to you; be with God always. Make this your foremost and forefront effort, for you have laid a foundation for yourselves, and you have laid forth the truth which is clear within your mind and your soul. Speak from that place of truth, act from that place of love, and know from that place within you that realizes and understands the Will of God. This is your challenge and I put this challenge before you all for without this foundational commitment and effort, you will produce something that is a mere reflection of mindful intentions rather than a powerful reflection of soul wisdom and knowing. With soul wisdom and knowing you are much closer to alignment with God's Will. Seek to be in that place, beyond the mind where all is soul and all is revealed as God communicates with you within your soul. Indeed, what God communicates can be multidimensional, multifaceted, complex in nature and this too often diverts your thoughts in an effort to analyze and express what it is that God has given you in His communications. We will assist you in this so that it shall be rendered down into something palpable and simple for it is in the complications and complexity of the human language and mindful understandings which can obstruct the true purpose of your efforts.

And so you must go to prayer. Come to know deeply, surely within your souls of what it is that God wishes for you to do. May His Love continue to awaken your souls and continue to open the doors of understanding, continue to be that guiding force, that guiding light, that wondrous sense of love and joy that comes with His blessings within.

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Matthew, and we continue to uplift you, support you, guide you in these efforts. Our love is with you all. God bless you. I am Matthew.
