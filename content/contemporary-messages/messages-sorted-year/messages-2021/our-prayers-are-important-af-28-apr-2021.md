# Our Prayers are Important for God's Service

I am Keea-atta Kem. I come to pray with you tonight, to encourage you in your prayers, for I think at times you lose sight of the work that you do. I wish to encourage you to see and appreciate that the times you spend together in prayer are very beneficial for your Earth plane, that indeed you continue to feed this fire of love, this great light that comes in response to your prayers. God uses each one of you to reflect the light of His blessings, not only to you and your loved ones, but to many others in your world. When you dedicate your time together in this way and you humbly put forth your prayers, and you come in unity and a desire to be channels of love and light in the world so you do God a service, you do the angels a service, and you do humanity a service. 

So many blessings come from these simple efforts and dedications. May you continue to seek the Love of God, to know His great blessings upon you, to be in this great flow of His Love and Will for humanity and all of creation. As you allow yourselves to be in that flow, do not judge or have expectations of the mind, but  express yourselves through your souls, which are ever growing and brightening within this great blessing of love. So the work will deepen, the blessings will multiply, and many, many souls will come to see and know and feel what God has to give to them. 

Many spirits surround you as you pray together. Those numbers are far greater than those of you who come together in this way. They come because they are drawn to the light. They come because something unique is given in this way, something that reaches their hearts, that opens their eyes and their minds and their souls to the greater possibilities of spiritual progression and light.

Your efforts have many aspects and layers and expressions in the world, the physical world and the spirit world. Continue to grow in this light, beloveds. Continue to come together in these dedications for they are indeed very important. You will find as time progresses that your work will expand as your souls expand in love. The light draws many, both in the flesh and in the spirit. So you will come to speak, to pray, to heal, to love as a single group, a single body of servants to God, of Love flowing, intensifying, powerful, beautiful, bringing peace and comfort to many.

May God bless you on your daily journeys towards God and these weekly efforts to be together in love. I love you, beloved souls. I continue to monitor your efforts and to help  assist and inspire each of you as you continue upon your journey of love.  

God bless you. I am Keea-atta Kem and I love you all so dearly, such beautiful souls, such light, earnestness, integrity, honesty, and great effort to bring light into your lives and light into the world.  Bless you, beloveds. May God bless your souls deeply, deeply. God bless you.
