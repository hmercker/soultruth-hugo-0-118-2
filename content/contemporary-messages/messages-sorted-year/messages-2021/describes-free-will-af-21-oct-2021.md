# Describes Free Will - Angels Will Not Interfere

God lays before you many opportunities to serve, to be a light in the world. You will find yourselves at times with a welcome dilemma and that is where you might spend your time in service to God. As you become more sensitive to God’s Will, so you begin to see the myriad of possibilities that God lays before you. With these many invitations, there can be some confusion and reluctance as to what you might apply yourself to in order to bring this truth of God’s Love to the world. In this material world, it is important to be focused within your mind and sure of your direction and your intentions because we will not and God will not do this for you. If there is a spirit that insists upon certain actions and efforts, I say to you, question that spirit for we are not inclined to direct forcibly what it is that you must do. As you know, we respect the Law of Free Will and will always do so, even when you choose to be contrary to God’s Will.

It is not that we withdraw our love or God withdraws His Love. Rather, we wait for you to come to that conclusion and understanding of what is intended. So, often we wait for you mortals to come to the right perspective, understanding, and clarity within your minds. That clarity resides within your soul always but it is a difficult challenge to have the desires of the soul and the mind in alignment and harmony. Though, as you continue to grow in God’s Love, so you will find yourself in greater harmony, the whole of you in alignment where clarity brings strength and strength brings resolve. It is easy to be distracted upon the Earth plane, to seek out those things that are pleasurable, to seek to be drawn away from those things that may seem challenging. But in fact, the challenges are merely reflections of your mind’s response and contradictory nature to that of the soul.

Resistance will melt away with prayer. With prayer comes love. With love comes a deeper understanding of truth and a greater knowledge of God’s Will. It is for you to decide for yourselves what it is you will focus on and how you will approach certain projects, intentions, and ventures. God merely lays forth the possibilities and the opportunities to act. As you come closer to alignment with God’s Will so the expression of these things will be easier and more fulfilling. The dilemmas will fall away. The difficulties will turn into harmonious outpourings of love. It is for you to choose, my friends. There is always a suggestion in the back of your mind, an intention that is born from the soul. Whether you listen and are aware is determined by your free will and by where your mind is focused, your desires which often lead you on the path of least resistance.

Many in your world are reluctant to struggle, to rise above, to be in greater harmony, to walk in a greater truth. Yet indeed, if you are to be God’s instrument, you are required to do so, not because we insist but because your soul knows that this is true. So, we allow you to take your journeys, to walk your path, to seek greater harmony with God. As you walk this path, know that we are with you by your side and are eager to assist you upon the journey given your acceptance and receptivity. Within each individual is a willful mind and a pliable soul. The struggle continues with every soul on this planet. Indeed, God is making a great effort to help humanity understand themselves and to open opportunities to do so. Each of you has the capacity and the gifts and the knowledge to help your brothers and sisters come to a greater understanding and greater clarity of truth.

May you continue on this path of service and find your way easily without too many detours and distractions but with a clear focus. You will find your way. All you need do is ask God to help you, to help you find clarity, direction and strength. That focus will come with the intention to do so and the ministrations of God and His angels upon you.  You are given much, my friends. You are loved greatly. May you find your way and release all that is in the way to greater light, greater service, and greater love.
 
God bless you. I am Andrew. My love is with you all. God bless you, my beloved friends.
