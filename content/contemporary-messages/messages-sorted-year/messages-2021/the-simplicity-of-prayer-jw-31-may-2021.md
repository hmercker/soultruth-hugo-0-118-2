# The Simplicity of Prayer

I am here your brother and friend Thomas Merton.  Some of you may be familiar with my life, with my work, more familiar than this one I have chosen to speak through today. You may know that I had a deeply inquisitive mind and I wished to explore every nook and cranny of spiritual life, religion, and philosophy. And as the Sufis would say ‘I wished to be in the world but not of it’.  This dichotomy inside of me was never fully amalgamated and yet I did explore and wrote with as much honesty as any seeker could and I had many followers, people who read my writings, listened to me. 

At one point when I did not feel connected in my heart and was overwhelmed by my busy mind, I began to explore Buddhism and that peace and calm that seemed to come with the Zen of their meditation. This was a wonderful discovery for me and as I did with anything, I immersed myself deeply, and yet my soul longed for at-onement. I wanted to feel the Christ love, to be Christ’ed in fact - what I now know as soul transformation. 

And more shocking than my sudden demise and entry into spirit was the discovery of the simplicity of prayer, not the detachment of the mind, but the engagement of the soul. I was greeted in spirit with so much love, so much guidance, all my questions answered and my prayers. 

So, I want to give you a very simple prayer. ‘Dear God touch my soul, take my whole heart into Your arms of love. Fill me with Grace that I may be one with You. Awaken me to Your Presence.  Heal me in Your love. And transform in Your Grace. Amen.’ 

I shall step back in the silence of this prayer and in the joy of God’s Grace, and in the company of such wonderful souls. Thank you. God bless you. I am Thomas.
