Dear Friends, I am Mylora.

I come to greet my dear and beautiful charge, who has been patient and also determined to come and be a part of this circle. During this time of patience, we have been able to accomplish much with her and through her in order to be integrated into this circle of light. So there will not be a lot of effort involved to bring her up to speed, as you would call it, with this circle. 

Today you are complete, today is the beginning of something quite extraordinary and beautiful. Today you will all find yourselves being opened and come to a place of shifts and changes that are truly a part of what is intended. There is nothing that will be left out of this program and process, but all will come together in unity and harmony. May we all be at peace in this great love of your desire and God's blessing. May we all know the light of his presence amongst us. May we be open, truly open of what God has to give us all. 

God bless you beloved souls, God bless you, keep you in his love, I am Mylora and I love you. Amen.
