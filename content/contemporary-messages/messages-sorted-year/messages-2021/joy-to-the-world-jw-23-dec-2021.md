# Joy to the World

December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


Tis the season to be jolly. Joy to the world. Rejoice! Glory to God on High! May you all focus on that which brings you joy, real happiness. Not just that which occupies your minds and your time but that which touches your souls. Which brings love and joy to your hearts and causes you to have empathy for every being. That which brings you to serve others knowing that it is better to give than receive. The joy of the giver in the knowing that you have helped another being. 

So, in the Grace of Godâ€™s love, in this sacred time of giving gifts, may you give the gift, the Divine gift, to all. And from all of us here, we love you! And I love you! In the love of God, in a mothers love, in a grandmothers love, in a sisters love, in a soulmates love. I am Care. God bless you this eve of the eve of Christmas. God bless you.
