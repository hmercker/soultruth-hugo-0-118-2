# Talk on Service

Faith Nyquist received by Al Fike

I am Faith. I wish to talk about the power of demonstrating the truth, that you cannot merely mouth the words or hand a book over to another and say *“this is the truth”*. You must follow it, especially in this time and age. It is an age of skepticism, materialism, where many do not have the inclination or the desire to think beyond the superficial. Indeed, many are asleep and do not wish to be awakened from their slumbers.

Yet, you desire to awaken humanity as did I when I walked the Earth. I put my heart and soul, my life into speaking the truth, at least the truth as I knew it. At times, I had many  people gather around me eager for my words and for my blessings as a healer and a counselor on spiritual matters. It took a great deal of my time and effort in these ministrations and dedications. With the consistency and the efforts that I made each and every day, in my desire to help and assist humanity as an instrument of God, so God put before me many souls. Some who inhabit the spirit world and some in the flesh. But indeed, each and every day presented to me an opportunity to serve, to use my gifts, to be a channel of love and light for another.

As for you, my beloved friends, you too have this desire. Yet, in some I see a passivity, an expectation that God will bring all to you, that you may not or need not venture forth and seek the opportunities to serve. But I say to you, it is both. At times, God will indeed bring those opportunities toward you provided you have the receptivity and the perceptions to recognize what God has brought, then you may serve in this way. At other times, God compels you to move out into the world, to be His active agent wherever you go. This may come in many forms, some very subtle indeed as you go about your daily business. Others are overtly shown to you as an opportunity to reach out to another.

Service can come in many different ways. It may not necessarily be speaking the words of truth. It is in expressing love in many different forms and outcomes. To touch another human being, everyone you meet on the street wherever you may be, who is in need of a blessing. As such, you can pray for a blessing for your brothers and sisters. You can pray that you are a clear channel of love wherever you go. You can ask God to use you as His instruments, to answer prayers, to be His active agent in the field, so to speak.

It is your desire and your motivation and your inclination as well as your gifts,  all come into play so that the doors that are presented to you may be opened and you may in some way affect a healing, a blessing, something of light, something of God to help to uplift another,  help heal another, to change the atmosphere around you from the heaviness that is often there to lightness and joy.

Some of you are very gifted in this regard. Others find it difficult to reach out and make an impression upon another that is positive and encourages them to open to you. It is a gift that some have in beautiful ways and others find challenging. There is always some way that you may serve, some way that you may open doors that God is eager for you to open so that you may bring a blessing to another.

I too had my share of criticism and skepticism. I too ran into much resistance especially within the Catholic church in which I did a lot of work and a lot of speaking. But in this, I drew many to me, especially those women who wished to have a voice within that church. You see when you choose a calling, something that you are passionate about, something that carries you along in a sense of purpose, in a sense of joyful fulfilment even when it is challenging, then you know that God is guiding you along a certain path. That you are indeed finding your way through guidance, through the blessings of your angel friends, through the knowings of your own soul.

I know many of you are perplexed in regards to this, that you do not truly understand nor do you feel confident in this role as one of God’s instruments. In order to overcome this reticence or this insecurity, one must step forward boldly, with trust, with faith that God is guiding you. At times, you may stumble. At times, you may be in error but often enough, you walk forward in light and do indeed fulfill God’s Will in some way. The more that you step along this path with confidence, with faith, with trust, so more will open to you and gifts will be honed and strengthened by your efforts and desire to serve.

It takes courage. It takes a deep desire and motivation to serve. Yet, to contradict these things, it takes humility and a willingness to listen. It is a fine line to walk upon, my friends, to be assertive and humble at the same time, to allow and yet to express together so that your will and God’s Will becomes intermingled into harmonious expressions. You will find yourself more and more in the light as you accept God’s invitation to serve Him in these ways. None of you are inadequate or incapable. All of you have many gifts, are well-grounded and in alignment with the Truth of God’s Love. How can you truly fail when this is so?

We are preparing you, my friends, for great things to come but they will not come with you sitting at home in prayer waiting. Rather, they must come with your actions and your testing of the truth and awakening those gifts within you through truly understanding yourself, truly knowing yourself, and knowing what you are capable of. You will find your way along this delicate line, this balance that is the instrument moving forward within the Will and Grace of God. It takes some experimentation, some effort, but indeed, it opens and often opens in surprising ways.

There is much that may come to you, beloved souls, as you come towards those opportunities that God has for you. Are you strong enough? Do you have enough faith? Is there a great upwelling of love within you for your brothers and sisters? As you see all around you a world that is in deep distress and difficulties, do you not see that it takes an individual of great dedication, of great passion to affect change in the world?

 I urge you to find those gifts within you. Find that purpose that God has placed within you and express these things. Do so as you pray to your Heavenly Father saying, *“Beloved and precious God, may you guide me along the path that I am meant to take and may you use me as your instrument upon that path. Place before me many who are meant to know this truth. Place before me those who are in need of comfort. Place before me those who are seeking to be comforted and those who are seeking to know the truth.”* With this prayer and earnestly and sincerely recited to God, you will find your days very full and many opportunities will come your way.

Be bold, my beautiful friends. Be in the Light of God’s Love always. Do not neglect the needs of your soul. Always put this first with each day and then allow the desires of God, the Will of God to be expressed through you. My precious and beautiful friends, each of you are a light. Each of you have much to give the world. Do not hide away but give in whatever way, whatever moment presents itself so that you know and recognize that God is gifting you with the opportunity to serve in love.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Faith and my love for you is deep and abiding for do we not all love God? God bless you. God bless you, loved ones.
