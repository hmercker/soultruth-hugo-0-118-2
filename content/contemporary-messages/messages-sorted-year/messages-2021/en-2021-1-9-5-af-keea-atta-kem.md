# Jesus Wants You to be a Sunbeam

Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

>Jesus wants you to be a sunbeam to light the world aglow 
And he walks with you all and helps you to realize your beautiful soul.  
May you come to know how beautiful you are to be that beam of light with every day 
As you walk upon the earth until that day you take flight.  
Jesus wants you to be a sunbeam, a beautiful soul for God.  
Be that wondrous creature that God has created 
 So you are blessed and you are given all that you need to glow.  
You are loved and cared for and embraced so to walk in that beautiful flow.  

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea and I love you. God bless you.
