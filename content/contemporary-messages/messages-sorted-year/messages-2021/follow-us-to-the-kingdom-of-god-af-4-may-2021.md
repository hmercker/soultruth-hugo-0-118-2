May God draw His great blanket of light over you, beloved souls. I am Simon and I reside within the Celestial Kingdom with all my beautiful brothers and sisters. We live in the paradise of God's Love that constantly feeds our souls. So we come to you, beloved brothers and sisters, to encourage you to continue to pray for this gift that you too may join us in this love-filled paradise, this place that God has opened for us, that we may reside in everlasting love and joy, and so we shall for all eternity.  

For those of you upon the Earth plane I say to you, put aside those things that draw you away from God and come close. Receive this great gift that God has to give to you. Know the great boon to your soul that is His blessing, His Essence that flows within and transforms you from mortal to immortal, from that which makes you human to that which makes you divine. Beloved souls, carry the truth both within your heart and your minds. Keep this foremost in your thoughts. Continue to beseech God for these blessings. Walk in the Light of God's Grace and all that you do and all that you touch will reflect this light, this gift upon you and upon your lives.

All that is happening in your world that is a reflection of the inharmonious conditions that mankind has made for himself will not touch you in any significant way. You, in your efforts and prayers, will know how to avoid and fend off these darkened conditions that do not bring the joy and peace that your souls so seek. You are meant to walk in this light always. God has ensured that you are truly in alignment with Him and His children in the light.

We all walk with our beloved brother and Master, Jesus, who leads the way and shows us the way to further redemption and growth within our souls. His bright light shines upon us all, his example, that of our brother who humbly gives to each of us the assurance and the understanding of how we may be transformed forevermore in God's Love.  

We are all God's children, beloved souls, so carry this light with you. Know that you are loved and that we too walk together upon this journey towards at-onement with God. I am with you. I am happy to pray with you today. One of the many, many angels who come to be with you, to assist you upon this journey, to reaffirm the truth that your souls know all too well and your minds continue to awaken to and comprehend in all its glory and ramifications to who you are and what you are to become, beloved angels of God. So you shall be as we walk this path together. 

God bless you, beloveds. I am Simon and I walk and pray with you, beloved souls. God bless you.
