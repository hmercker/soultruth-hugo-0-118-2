James Padgett Study Group, Gibsons, BC, Canada

James Padgett received by Al Fike

May the Father’s Love flow into your soul, my friends. I am James Padgett and I come to encourage you to study these truths that have been laid before your feet. All the truth that is God’s Love, His Presence, His Soul, your soul, the great meaning of life, and the destinies of every soul are within the volumes of pages that have been written through me and spoken through this instrument, and many others. There is a great wealth of knowledge available to every one of you, provided you are interested to seek, to read, to contemplate, to come to this great gift and body of knowledge with earnest souls.

In this effort to seek truth it is our hope that truth will rest from your minds to your souls, and will come to be a part of your awareness, your soulful knowledge of truth. In this resting place of the soul may you come to utilize those truths in your daily lives. For what good is truth without applying it with each day, without living it from the very depths of your soul, the very feelings of your heart, the very intentions of your minds, to walk and speak and act within the body of truth that is given to you as such a powerful gift to help guide and motivate you forward spiritually?

The great frontier of your world my friends, is not seeking the realms of outer space or the depths of the oceans. It is the soul. So little is known of the soul. So much can be known of the soul, provided you are open and willing to venture forth, travellers towards light, towards truth, towards all that God has created and laid before you in your lives. Seek the truth my friends, know the truth, truly. Let it sink to your souls and may you come upon great ventures, experiences, awarenesses, and love. For all of those things await those willing to venture forward and seek to know their own souls and to seek to know God’s great Soul.

In this you will find joy and fulfillment. You will find the power of truth. You will find that all of your questions are answered. The angels have put forth great efforts to give to you the knowledge that you require to awaken to truth within your souls and to accept truth within your minds. May God bless you on that journey. I desire to assist you all in awakening to truth, to seeing your way to the great treasure trove of God’s blessing of Truth upon you all. My love is with you. May God bless you deeply. I am James Padgett and I pray with you today. God bless you.
