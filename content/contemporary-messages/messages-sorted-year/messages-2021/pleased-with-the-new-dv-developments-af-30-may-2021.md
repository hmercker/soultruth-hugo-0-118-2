This is Seretta Kem. So you embark upon another step in this great adventure that you have committed yourself to service, and support others who wish to serve in these capacities. I applaud you for your dedication and your desire to serve in this way. As you spread the possibility of these forms of communication happening in the world, so you enhance God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. 

You have increased the possibilities of more souls, lost souls, coming to know the Truth of God’s Love through those individuals who are now poised to dedicate themselves to service in this way. You have opened up a new avenue of service, a new possibility of gifts manifest in the service of love for humanity. We are indeed poised to assist you in this effort, to gather you all as you continue to focus upon this task and dedicate time and prayer and in supporting one another in this unfolding venture.

You are all blessed, those who have dedicated much time to this and those who begin in this way. You are all blessed. You will all find your way, provided you are sincere and you have a sincere desire to be a part of this venture for the upliftment of humanity. Much comes to those who are earnest and those who are dedicated and those who are attuned to their souls, knowing God has given this opportunity, this open door to serve in this way. 

You will all find your way, beloveds. Indeed, those barriers that may come into place on your journeys will fall away as God blesses your efforts, as God intervenes on your behalf, and the angels work diligently to ensure your participation and ensure that you may be blessed deeply and that you may be prepared fully. 

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. I’m happy to speak to you today, to be with you today in this blessed time of prayer and dedication and service in the name of truth and love. God bless you.
