Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloveds, I am Keea Atta Kem. That great bridge of Light and Truth continues to be forged between you and God. And God continues to pour His blessings upon you through this dedication of love and prayer that you bring together as a group and individually in your daily life. It is the consistency and fervency of your prayers, beloveds, that will bring the results that you seek, will open the portals of truth and experience and knowing and love that help to secure you in this truth and build your faith accordingly.

Beloved and beautiful souls, you are precious to God, precious to us who reside within the Celestial kingdom. There is nothing that God will not do in order to secure you in this Truth for all of God's generosity and Love towards you is given unreservedly to each of you. It is for you to awaken to this and to receive it in all its power and glory. You determine the flow of this blessing upon you through your thoughts, your desires, your actions and your efforts.

Those of you who focus daily upon God will receive the benediction that is meant to be. Though some of you may be somewhat casual in your approach to this, I say that in time your commitment will deepen and your desire will expand and grow and help fulfill God's desire to awaken you. There is so much that awaits you, beloveds. The great key is in your desire to receive this gift of Divine Love, the Essence of God. In this way all that your soul desires, all that your soul is capable of receiving, will be fulfilled and awakened as it continues to forge this beautiful bridge between you and God.

Be at peace, beloved souls, know that God's healing touch and comfort, His beautiful blessings upon you, His Love, are pouring upon you at this moment. As it pours upon you, know that it is also touching those around you, your loved ones, your friends and associates, that indeed this great multiplying gift and blessing touches many as you continue to pray. Open wide your souls to receive the gift of God's Love. Allow this gift to multiply and touch others as God uses you for His channels of Love. You are blessed, beloveds, truly blessed upon the path that will in time bring at-onement with God.

God bless you, beloveds, I am with you often. I pray with you. I come to bring blessings to you, I am one of God's agents, one of many who minister to you all. God bless you, I am Keea, I love you.
