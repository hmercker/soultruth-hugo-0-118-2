# This Simple Choice

I am here, your brother in Christ, Francis. In my early days on Earth, I experienced the world; I had my agenda; I had dreams of grandeur, many sensual desires, and as you may know, I was set to inherit a considerable amount of wealth and business. So, all my plans were lined up. And then, of course, I had an awakening. And as I have spoken before, I had to consider if I were to pass into spirit, what in fact could I take with me? In that moment of clarity, I realized what was truly important to my heart, to my soul, and my life became a prayer. The poverty that I adopted turned out to be a great treasure. The plan that I abandoned for God’s plan turned out to be the greatest blessing, and many were attracted. Yes, people came for food, and clothing, and community, but above all they came for communion in the Holy Love of God and His Grace. And as we prayed, and sang, and served, this simple surrender, this simple choice, became a profound blessing, and to this day there are those who walk this path. And as my beloved Claire conveyed to you, when you release all from the heart to God, you will receive, as you have, the great inflowing and infilling of His Love in His Most Holy Presence. 

Whenever you are confronted with that which is less than love, send up that request that prayer for protection, for grace. And when you do this, any negativity surrounding you will dissipate as the Divine Love comes in and harmonizes the situation. So yes, pray for the Earth, pray for the world, send this love that you have in your souls, send this light this beautiful, as you say, lattice of light. Let it embrace the world and lift it up, as it lifts you up above the world, above your concerns and troubles, in the joy, in the grace, in the bliss of God. May all here receive this great gift, this showering of Love. I shall step back and be with you in this benediction, and I thank you. I am your brother in Christ, Francis of Assisi, now a celestial angel and your eternal friend on this path of God’s Love. Go in peace and God bless you.
