Jesus received by Al Fike

A blessing upon you, beloveds, I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to bless you in your efforts, to uplift you, to inspire you that Light may indeed pour upon each one of you and that God may indeed touch your souls deeply with His Love.

Remember that you serve your Heavenly Father, that God has placed before you a blessing and a request to bring the Love and Truth of His Creation to this world. May you find your way upon the path that is designated, that you may know that you walk upon that path and feel the surety of your steps upon that path. Be a channel of Love, of Truth, of all that is in harmony with God's Creation. In so doing you will know a great joy, a deep and abiding joy, and a sense of fulfillment that will come with your work, with the doors that will open and the blessings that will come.

I bless each one of you, beloveds. My love, my appreciation is with you all for all your dedicated work, for all that is unfolding in God's plan. So you will walk upon this road flanked by angels. You will know the path that you trod, the purpose that you have, the efforts that God will guide you to make on behalf of His Will and desire to bring the Truth of His Love to humanity. You will be firm upon that path and will not waver.

Beloveds continue to seek the great gift of God's Love, to awaken to this gift that your souls may know the journey that it must take, that you will see all the efforts that you will make, and you will find your way upon that path that is God's Will and desire for you. Together you make a formidable force that will indeed have its effects upon your world. Continue to be together in harmony, to walk together trusting one another and allowing each to express their gifts and insights and abilities for the benefit of this great venture.

You are blessed, beloveds, you are blessed and surrounded in Light. God's Love is with you, His grace rests upon you, the deep peace of His presence is with you, beloveds. God bless you. I am with you always for wherever a soul seeks to be in alignment with Truth and with God, receiving His Love, so I am with them, their brother upon the road. God bless you, beloveds, my love is with you.
