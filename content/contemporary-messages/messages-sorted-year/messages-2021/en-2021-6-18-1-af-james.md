# Your Journey to the Celestial Heavens is Shortened by Prayer for Divine Love

June 18<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

James received by Al Fike

Bless you, blessed and beloved souls, I am James. The road to heaven is not as long as you might think. Although heaven seems far off from this earthly plane, as you prepare your souls in prayer and awaken to God's Love each and every day, so you shorten the journey substantially, a journey that for some may take many, many years to accomplish, far longer than the earthly life. But when you lay the foundation as you are upon the earthly plane, so you cut that journey, the length of that journey substantially.

So together we pray for the gift of God's Blessings upon us in order that we may be in harmony with all that God has created, with our beautiful souls, with His Truth of Love. And together we journey towards greater light and love. Together we are united upon this journey, and those have awakened before you come to help you in your awakening.

We bring our wisdom, our strength, our love, in order to assist you upon your journey towards God. It is our great joy and opportunity in service to be with you upon this road. We are your friends, your brothers, your sisters, and we are truly here for each one of you. As you continue to reach for God and receive His Love, so we surround you in our attempts to awaken your understanding, to encourage and inspire, to throw our love around you like a cloak that will keep you from the dark forces of your world. God empowers us to do so and you empower us to work with you through your prayers. So we journey together upon this beautiful path and we are united in love, truly seen and known from your souls.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am James your brother, James your helper, James who prays with you and seeks greater Love with you. May God bless you each upon this journey, beloved souls. May God bless you deeply. My love is with you all. God bless you.
