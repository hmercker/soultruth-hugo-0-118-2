Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Seretta Kem. You are beginning to understand your sensitivities and what may come of your time together in this circle of development and awakening. At times, this may come as a surprise, may be challenging as you find your way through the maze of various perceptions and heightening of various faculties within you. There is always a need for adjustment when it comes to the development of psychic gifts and spiritual faculties. This cannot be avoided. For as anything in the material plane, there is a need to adjust to new conditions and new situations.

We are here to assist you in this adjustment. Know that we will protect you always, that there will not be such a condition or a situation that will cause you physical or emotional harm. The spirit body is very resilient and will not carry those conditions or startling responses that may come in the conditions in which you are a part of at this time. You are being cared for, beloved souls. God does not abandon any of His children nor does God bend you to the point where you break. Rather, you will continue to grow and be strengthened by this environment and by the experiences you may have in this environment.

You are coming to know the possibilities of your spirit bodies and spirit mind and the faculties that are embedded within it. This will be unique for each individual in this circle. Some will find acute sensitivities. Some will find disorientation. Some will not believe or accept the great shifts within consciousness that are coming, but this will be temporary. As the adjustments come, there will be an integration and harmonious acceptance of these new experiences that will come on all levels in those ways that you are not used to nor familiar with.

Beloved souls, this is a journey. What journey does not have its surprises and challenges? It is for you to be tender and supportive of one another, to be sensitive to those challenges that may come for each person in this circle. These things will not be predictable. The timing will be different for each individual. The experiences and sensitivities will reflect the unique nature of each individual.

Indeed, there is much that will come. You are only a third of the way through your journey together. The intensity will build as you continue upon this journey. Even those of you who have claimed to not possess gifts of perception and ability to know the spiritual aspects of life in a material way, will come to these gifts in your own unique journey and your own unique experience. This is inevitable because each of you possess gifts and abilities. Each of you possess a spirit body. Each of you have faculties that will help you to understand the complexities of life, the existence of the many layers of life, and the existence of many layers within you. This is to be revealed as you continue in your progression.

In the past, we have emphasized and we shall continue to emphasize the awakening of your soul, receiving the great gift of God’s Love, to lay the foundation that is a soul resplendent with the Essence of God within it. Many of you have built up so much foundation, a great beginning point to your awakening. These faculties will not come unless you are prepared and you have within you a solid foundation. As you continue down this road, the experience of life will change dramatically and deeply. With this experience and with this opening of faculties, there will come great joy and appreciation of the wonderment and the intricacies of God’s creation that is you, that is life.

You will see many things that have been a mystery to you. You will come to know aspects of yourself that have been a mystery. In this, you will know a sense of fulfillment, of wisdom, of joy, for who does not wish to know the Truth of God’s creation? If you wish to hide away from the truth, then I say you are on a path that will reveal truth in depth and beauty and wonderment that may be challenging to your mind but will affirm the truth of your soul.

Your minds are most certainly a perplexing and contradictory thing within you. Your minds are a reflection of eons of ancestral conditioning that have infiltrated even your genetic make-up. So, in regards to these things of which I speak, there is a reflexive reaction to doubt and to reject these experiences and perceptions. To countermand this inherent condition within you is the great power of the Divine Love within your soul. Changes that come with this gift, the transformation that is continuing to have its effects upon you will in time correct this deeply embedded error that is a reflection of mind.

You will come to know the truth and recognize it. You will come to accept the truth and do so joyfully, embracing all that this entails. This brings a smile to God as you come closer to truth, to awakening these beautiful and exceptional parts of yourself which are truly a reflection of your soul. You are upon a journey that God has guided you to and takes great joy in observing your awakening. For in this awakening, you will come closer to God, be in greater alignment with God and in greater alignment with the universe of God’s creation.

We join you in this journey and also feel great joy in our observations as we see you overcome one hurdle after another and adjust accordingly. In time, you will experience such a love for all creation, for all humanity, and for yourself, the joy will be in every breath. Recognition will come with every heartbeat. Truth will glow within you and about you. With this, you will truly be a powerful and beautiful instrument of God’s Will and Love and Truth. This is our goal. Within that goal will come the manifestations of many blessings through you. You will find yourself guided by God to reach many souls, to be in many unique places upon your Earth, to spread the Truth of Love wherever you go.

This is God’s plan and you have accepted your role as part and parcel of this plan. Many blessings are to come. Now, may you open to a great inflowing of God’s Love allowing the awakening and transformation to bring to you all that is required upon this journey.

God bless you, my friends. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. We journey together. I am with you. God bless you.
