Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

It is your Professor Salyards. I greet you and I welcome you back to your collaborations and continued unfolding of the realization of this plan.

Challenges are everywhere, my friends. You have the challenge of growing your own soul. You have the challenge of dealing with the material world. You have the challenge of overcoming thoseTitle:

barriers which keep many souls who are seeking from knowing that you even exist and what you have to offer to your brothers and sisters. Indeed, many challenges to overcome.

But now is the time to put the axe to the grindstone so to speak, to be focused and apply yourselves to the needs that are at hand, what is required of you at this time. We cannot do the work for you. If we could, we would joyfully accept the challenge to do so. But we can be with you as your work. We can uphold you as you step forward and apply yourselves to what is needed. Work does not have to be a burden. Work can be a joyous thing. When you feel the flow and momentum building, does this not bring joy to your hearts? Do you not sense that something is being accomplished and that rather then feeling stymied and confused there is clarity and a sense of direction? This often happens when one takes that initial step forward saying *"I will put my hand to this and see what comes of it."* Indeed, the first attempt may not be the most satisfactory but at least the momentum has begun to build. As you continue to apply yourself, so momentum builds ever greater and what may come may indeed be quite astounding and wonderful.

You know the ways of the world. We know the ways of the world. We understand that at times there are great challenges but at other times doors of opportunity open. Indeed, when all is in alignment with God, then those doors open readily and the opportunities abound within that flow and direction that is given. Seek to be inspired, my friends. Seek to know that God is with us all in these ventures and that the objective is to bring many souls who are yearning and seeking and desiring to know God and liberated in the Love of God may come and be nourished by that which you have to give and offer to your brothers and sisters. Always work in harmony and love and in this way what will result from your work will be harmony and love.

There is nothing now that will hold you back to such a degree that you will be stymied. Rather you have grown, my friends, you have grown. Your lights are brighter. Your insights are deeper. You have even added another beautiful soul to your wonderful and simple gathering. So the time is now to act, to be focused and to allow God to influence the flow of your actions and the focus of your minds and your souls. It is in asking God to guide you, to bless you, to open you to His Love that the highest and most beautiful outcomes may be accomplished. It is an act of faith, an act of the desires of your soul put forth in the physical world. This you must do readily and often if you are to truly be a channel of God's Love and Will in the world, stepping forward with ease and confidence,  clarity and true soul desire. Can you go wrong with these criteria? Will your be circumvented? Will your efforts be for nothing? No, my friends. As you have experienced you have seen and will see how when  enacting God's will, many things are accomplished, many opportunities are apparent and much comes of your simple desire to serve. You will be inspired and others will be inspired.

Indeed, the time is ripe and the time is now. You must take advantage of what time you have to bring about those things that you have aspired towards for a number of months now but in essence have not gotten particularly close to the realization of them. Although I do not mean to say that you have been derelict at your duties for you have not, but now is the time to bring into form and action that which is within your mind and soul's ideals to make this concrete, to make it usable, to make it apparent to those who are seeking and desire to find their way in the Light. You are light bringers, beloved souls, and so I beseech you to bring light into the world. Bring light and know that we are behind you, in front of you, beside you. We are with you and shall continue to uphold you in these efforts. We are all God's servants, all God's children, and will work in harmony with a deep synchronicity that will accomplish much. We will bring those whom you require and who have the gifts and abilities. We will make possible the resources that you need. But within yourselves and together you must be unified and clear. In this way you release that linchpin which is holding back the momentum and allow things to move forward.

Be in the grace of God, my friends. Know your soul's desires. Know God's desires and God's plan. As you continue to align yourself with God's plan, so the adjustments and fine tuning will take place with ease and beauty. You will find great joy in your efforts, wondrous, wondrous efforts to bring the truth of God's Love to the world To support those who want to bring light to your world and be together as a family of light in the world. These things are evolving and will materialize as you step forward.

God bless you, my friends. I am Professor Salyards. I am happy to see you together today. May you continue ever inspired, ever strong and clear. Your road is that of Love. You will step upon that road, beloved and beautiful children of God. My love is with you and the love of many angels is with you. God bless you, God bless you each and every one.
