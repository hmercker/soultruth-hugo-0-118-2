# Keep a Song in Your Heart

I come in the grace of God with a song in my heart and the Divine Love in my soul. I am Hazrat Inayat Khan. 

It is written that in the beginning was the word and from that all creation began. In the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita, which means the Song of God, it is the sound and the song and the vibration that is the creative force. When Master Jesus healed his soul burning with the love of God, those words, their vibration, enabled the recipient to feel the healing force of God’s love and it brought faith and changed the lives of each one. I was a musician and a Sufi, and I brought Sufism to the West with music and poetry and my writings all about how to connect with God, to feel the Presence of God and to be open to it. This is the power of sound, the magnificence of song. 

When I came to your circle today, I was impressed that you began with a beautiful song that allowed so many to open up; to receive the gift. This is true of the highest spiritual work of musicians. It a service unique the vibrations of which can heal, can bring joy, can uplift. Because in fact, all spiritual music is a prayer unto the Creator. So, it is appropriate to begin any prayer session with music. 

When one speaks the listener can perceive the intention often regardless of what the words are saying. For instance, when a doctor speaks with empathy and love to a patient whatever their condition, it is a healing force, and it is a blessing unto them. I wish you all whether you are musically inclined or not, to be mindful of the vibrations of your voice. For did not Master Jesus say, ’It is not what goes in a man’s mouth that defiles him, but what comes out?' And he spoke with love and the authority of heaven. 

I would encourage each one when you feel lost, when you feel overwhelmed, and when you feel perhaps you cannot meditate or pray to find music. And find a song or a melody that resonates with your heart for each one of you is indeed a song. I shall not continue today but come again and I am so pleased with my brother though somewhat reluctant agreed to allow me to speak today. May you all be blessed in the love of God and keep a song in your heart and in your soul. In the love of God and the Eternal song I am your brother and friend. I am Hazrat Inayat Khan. God bless you!
