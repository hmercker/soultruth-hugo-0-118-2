# Explore the truth with your souls

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   

I am here your brother, friend and guide, James Padgett 

Dear friends of my soul, I have been with you today in this study group listening, guiding, encouraging and influencing your souls to reach out in love. I am an inhabitant of the Celestial heavens with my soulmate, my dear Helen and I want to encourage you all to read the messages I received so that you may know these truths that are as true today as they were over 100 years ago when I began to receive them. As the love of God is eternal, so are His laws and His truths.  

You are a somewhat diverse group, and you have different sensibilities coming from different areas of interests and studies but the one factor that binds you together is the desire of your souls for love and to understand from the human condition the great truths of the Kingdom of God. 

As you have been told and you may be aware of, I received many messages on many topics, some of which had never been revealed to mankind, humankind, you would say. I wish you all to explore the natural love and the Divine Love that you may understand the difference between them, one which is of the human nature and given to every soul, and the other that is eternal, unchanging and yet transforming. 

When you have this feeling of soul mate love or a deep love for any other soul, the feeling that you have is the closest thing in human nature to this feeling of Divine love. And yet the Divine Love supersedes even the greatest human love of a mother for her child and at the same time it embraces all. 

So, as you explore this path to the Celestial kingdom, allow your souls to be touched that you may feel the glow, the glory, the magnificent and eternal bliss that the Creator has for each of you. Let your souls ascend and be lifted. You can give your mind a rest even as you read the subject matter and I encourage you to feel the substance, the essence of the truths contained in what are known to you as the Padgett messages. And yes, I was deeply honored to receive them and to be changed by the truths within them.  

With all my love and blessings and support from the Celestial kingdom, I am your humble servant and brother in Godâ€™s love, James Padgett. God bless you.
