# The Light Grows Within Us as We Pray for Divine Love

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Matthew received by Al Fike

As the worldly conditions drift in and out of your lives, know that because you have forged this allegiance with God seeking to awaken your soul, seeking that His Essence, His Love flows into it in ever greater measure, that these conditions will not affect you like they do many others. Though you may be aware of these conditions, what we call the human condition, it has lost its potency in your life. You have come to a place of greater light, of resilience and strength of light that has been brought about because of  the transformative effects of God’s Love within your souls.

This Love grows and expands within you making a beautiful cloak of light around you which is powerful in its ability to fend off the darkness. Though there are times when you are susceptible to these conditions of darkness, generally you are protected. You wear this cloak of light because you have prayed to be with God. As you continue to pray each day and do so with fervency, commitment and frequency, this light grows brighter. You become one of those rare souls upon your planet that carries the gift of God’s Love as you walk among your fellow man in whatever way, means and opportunities that you do so. You are influencing and affecting the atmosphere around you with this light that you carry. In conjunction with this light you have with you, you have your angel friends who walk and carry their light which is great, and so together you become a powerful channel of light for God.

Because you have made it possible for we in the Celestial Kingdom to make rapport with you upon this earthly plane, many blessings that often you are not aware of, nor the individual who is being blessed is aware of, there is a deep blessing that goes to the soul of the individual or individuals whom you are engaging with. Thus you become a powerful channel for God to utilize for the benefit of humanity.

Each one of you standing in the Grace and Light of God, each one of you saying your prayers and making it known to God that you wish to be a channel of light, bringing blessings to your brother and to many, so the work will grow because your beautiful lights will grow and you will release all those conditions that inhibit and dampen this light.

Soon you will know the guidance of God whispering in your ear, talking to your soul, guiding you forward so that you may indeed know the steps that you might take for the benefit of another as a loving channel for many. These things come as you grow in light. These things come because your soul continues to be purified and transformed by the inflowing of God’s Love.

You will see in the coming months and years, a great difference in your attitudes, in your abilities to be a beautiful channel of love for another, and to see these things through the eyes of your soul. You will have great compassion and empathy for another. These things grow as you grow. The faculties of the soul awaken and make themselves known in their beautiful and unique capacities which are a part of each of you and rests within your soul.

May you continue to forge that link between your conscious mindful self, and the consciousness of your soul, enhanced by the consciousness of God. When they come together in powerful synchronicity, in a beautiful closeness and harmony, you will know these things of which I speak in ways that are powerful and clear and beautiful. It will bring you great joy to know these things, to feel them, and express them in your life.

Much will unfold as God makes great effort to utilize your gifts and your abilities as a light, as a beautiful channel of love for the world. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Matthew. I am happy to be with you, to speak with you and to pray with you as are many from our beautiful Celestial Kingdom who have come to be with you, to pray with you, to love you, and to minister to you, all of us doing God’s work, beloveds, all of us in the light. God bless you. My love is with you all. God bless you.
