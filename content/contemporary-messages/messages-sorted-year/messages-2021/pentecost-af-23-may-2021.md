Is there a day where God provides for His children a greater abundance of Divine Love? But this, like every day, has the potential of the great experience of the Pentecost to take place. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to assure you, beloved souls, that every day brings this blessing in equal measure and equal opportunity to receive this gift that you call the Pentecost which was the response from God to the prayers of those who followed the Master, Jesus, on Earth and who were greatly uplifted and blessed as a result of these prayers, the intensity of which were powerful and focused and each exhibited great faith. Where indeed, these true and beloved friends and followers of Jesus put aside their worries and cares and replaced them with prayers and a desire to be guided and blessed by God because they took seriously Jesus’ teachings and applied them to the dilemmas that they faced at the time.

So you may do the same, beloved friends, to put aside those doubts and worries and cares and distractions, to be present with God fully in attention and desire to receive this great blessing and to know the transformation of your soul and the great Touch of His Love. Can we do this together, beloved souls? To be in the Grace of God, each one of you wherever you are in this world, to be with God truly, to be in that Grace, to open yourself fully, to know that sweet vulnerability of the soul so tender, so in need of God’s Touch so that all that defends you, all that is armor around you, that cloak of thought and condition that those of you on the Earth plane wear so tightly around you, may be shed at this moment. That the nakedness of your soul may be revealed to God and that within your mind is a deep longing and desire to be with God without any contradiction, any part of you that resists.

In this way, you will know the Pentecost, beloved souls. I urge you with each day to apply this lesson that you may truly be with God. In this experience, you will know humility, joy, upliftment, and the great flames of Love surrounding your soul and awakening you to all that can be in God’s Embrace.

Beloveds, we are together in a sacred moment. May each of you embrace the sacredness, the holiness that comes with true prayer. God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to pray with you in these blessed moments. We are all children of God. We are all together in light. We are truly blessed. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. God bless you.
