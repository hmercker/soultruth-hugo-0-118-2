I come, my brothers and sisters, I come to be with my beloved family on earth, those who follow the truth of the soul reclaimed by God with His Love. I come because my love for you is great. I come because you are lights in the world and your prayers beckon the angels forth to be with you in this world.

I come because this world is in great need of this light and we of the Celestial Kingdom are God’s harbingers of God’s Truth and Light and Love. We beckon you forth, beloved souls, upon the journey of transformation that you too may know the great truth of God, and understand, feel and recognize this truth, that God’s Love for you is immense and never ending. It is here at this moment to infill your souls and bring to you the great transformation that comes with this gift.

Are we not together in this truth, beloveds? Are we not God’s instruments in the world? And nothing can be accomplished alone. It requires the banding together, the dedication, the loving commitment that comes with these Circles of Light and efforts that result from these prayers, the inspiration that comes from God to each of you to act as a channel of light in the world awakening, awakening all the potentials and beautiful gifts of your souls. May you come to recognize these gifts within you, beloveds. Do not shy away from this knowledge and understanding of the deep recesses of your soul which harbor magnificent treasures awaiting the Touch of God to be awakened.

You are His children, beloveds, you are His children. May you come to know this truly and deeply. May you come to see yourselves in all the glory that is His Love for you and the glory that is His Love expressed through you. We walk together hand in hand. We are truly brothers and sisters. God’s Love for you is just as great as God’s Love for me. Each of us must come to understand the immensity of His Love and absorb the blessing of His Love so that we may all walk in the grace of His Love and that you may stride forward in a clear path towards your entry into the Celestial Kingdom where we will all partake of the joys and blessings of the Father together.

We are truly united in our souls for our souls have come to recognize a truth so profound, so beautiful, so powerful that none can deny His existence, none can thwart you from this journey, for your souls have strengthened in Love and awakened in Love and will carry you forwards in Love. We are blessed with the great inflowing of the Father’s Love. We have come to know this as a truth. We are God’s children truly in this knowledge and we are brothers and sisters always. For all eternity, beloveds, for all eternity we are brothers and sisters upon this path and will come to know the glories and wonderment of God’s blessings for all eternity. Beloved souls, may we walk together in unity, in harmony, in peace, in truth and come to truly, truly be the bright lights that we are destined to be in the great firmament of God’s creation.

God bless you, beloveds, I am with you. My love is you. We are all together in this light. Allow your souls to drink the mighty waters of Love and be refreshed in the Light of God’s Touch and peace. Together we stand in Light. Together we are unified in Truth. Together we know the presence of God. God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend, I am Jesus and I am very happy that you are together in this Light of Truth. God bless you, God bless you, beloveds. Our souls sing the praises of God. God bless you.
