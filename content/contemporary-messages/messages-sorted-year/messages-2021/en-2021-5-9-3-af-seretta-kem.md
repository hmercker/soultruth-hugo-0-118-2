# Response to Questions About Development Circle

May 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. I have come to answer your questions, beloved daughter. Yes, we are pleased that there will be more offshoots of your efforts to develop the Direct Voice. We will continue to support and uphold these efforts. We cannot determine who will arrive at your doorstep for we cannot circumvent free will but there are many candidates that are interested and each one will bring their own particular strengths and blessings and gifts to contribute to this effort. But it is for them to decide and it is for you to accept whatever combination and grouping may form with your invitation.

Do not exclude anyone for because of the intransigence of the Earthly conditions, there are many barriers in the way of those who wish to come and who may not be able to fulfill those wishes. So it is a matter of accepting who can come through your doors and be a part of these groups. Indeed, if there are too many, then it will be prudent to split these groups into two. I know this is more commitment of time for you both but this may be what is required.

The development time will not be as extended as it was with your original group, nor over a period of years but it will be intense, shorter bursts of time with those who are able to make the commitment until the completion of this series of development protocols are completed. There is always the possibility that those who begin this journey will not complete for many different reasons.

You see, the conditions of the Earth plane are tumultuous and bring many difficulties for you upon this plane so we must be flexible and open and faithful. You have several months before we will begin and things will be clarified in these ensuing times. There is no need to be anxious or try to coordinate as I know, beloved daughter, is your inclination, rather, to allow things to unfold given a reasonable amount of time to do so.

In this way, the best outcomes may be accomplished. I would suggest that you do not exclude anyone who is interested, rather to invite them and see what their responses may be. Allow God to orchestrate these things, beloved daughter. Rest assured that all will be in harmony and peace with beautiful outcomes.

Do not let go of your faith. Do not assume that you know better than God in terms of these plans. Do not worry. Do not fret. But be at peace and know that we will indeed help to orchestrate. Follow our guidance from God and those who are meant to come will follow theirs. It will unfold in harmony in relation to God’s Will.

I hope that this answers your question, beloved daughter. As always with spiritual work, it is a flow and unfolding of events. Some of which are known and some of which are not. There is always the component of those things that are not predictable, those outcomes that are not seen, those conditions which build and evolve with time. This is why your spiritual journey is full of surprises, full of outcomes, full of individuals who you have not anticipated in their efforts and your bonds together, working together for a time, for a time. Then, at times, these individuals move away and often they come back. It is the ebb and flow of the human will, the outpouring of human desire, the defining and clarity of God’s Will through that individual which comes the test and trials and tribulations of each life. There will be disappointments but also surprises. There will be at times, predictability and at other times, mystery.

This is the way of your world. It shall always be this way, beloved souls, provided the human condition continues to manifest in your world and free will dominates the decisions of humanity. Will this condition leave at any time in the near future? Will it be resolved? No, beloveds. There is still much work to do, much efforts to be given from our side of life and yours as we continue to work together and strive for the highest and best outcomes with the great blessings that come when God’s Hand is upon you, the beautiful outpouring of His Love, His Light, His healing, His peace. All these things that come from God shall continue to flow and affect you, change you, heal you.

May you continue upon this journey, beloved souls. May you continue to hear God’s call and now God’s Will and that peace may reign within you, that love may be expressed through you, that all that is within you may come to harmony, may come to a wonderful fruition of all the potentials and beauty wonderment that is your soul.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Seretta Kem. I’m happy to be with you today upon this journey, this continued unfolding of possibilities and potentials of God’s Will intermingled with your life and your will and your soul. All will be well, beloveds, all will be well. God bless you. God bless you deeply with His Love. I am close as are many. God bless you.
