# Spiritual Immunity

April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here your sister in God’s love, Clare. My dear kind mice I can tell you that Robert Lees<sup>1</sup> was beyond flattered that you are reading what he received, those writings that have been in obscurity for so long. It is indeed a worthwhile endeavor to pursue an understanding of the spirit world that was depicted in such a beautiful way.  [He will come and speak to you](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2021/the-author-of-through-the-mists-is-very-grateful-jw-13-apr-2021/) as you proceed, but today I come asking each one of you to be at peace, to take care of your bodies, to let go of those things of the earth life that concern you. 

When you spend more time in prayer, in peace, and in the vibrations of God’s Love you will create an immunity that will help you mightily in your earth life, but even more so in your soul’s life and the life to come in spirit. My dear ones, pray, pray often as you can. Open you hearts to God and He will bless you through and through. The Divine love of the Father carries His grace, His healing His joy His embrace. Let us take a few moments more to open to His love and be still in his blessing. 

I shall step back and be with you in silence for a few moments. I go in peace and I love you. I truly do. I am your sister in Christ, Clare of Assisi.
