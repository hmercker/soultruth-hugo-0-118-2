# We Are Bonded Together in God's Love

March 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mary received by Al Fike

…I am Mary. I am so happy that you come together to pray, to beseech God for His great gift of Love, for it is this gift that bonds you together. No matter where you are in the world, you are bonded at this moment in the Grace of God's Love that uplifts you and carries you into Light, so that you may release all those conditions that are of the Earth plane and find respite in the Arms of God. That His Grace and Love envelops you, heals you, and brings you into that place of joy and upliftment.

This is what your souls seek. The yearnings of your souls are what brings you to this encounter with God. In the yearnings of your souls, in your prayers, your thoughts directed heavenward, so we may come and be with you in this prayer, each with an angel by their side, each given blessings from God, each opened and awakened a little more to this Truth of God’s Love, this place of Grace. So we walk together for these moments, find the music of our souls and listen, listen to God's Whispers echoing through your soul into your minds, knowing that you are indeed claimed by God, loved by God, and that we all rejoice in this Love, this great blessing for the soul. So through this unity, many blessings will come, many prayers will be answered, much light will come to this world, so in need of light.

Now we pray together in the Light and Truth of God's Presence and Love for us all. We are together in Love. God bless you beloved souls, I am Mary. I am with you in prayer. I am with you in my heart. I am with all those on the earthly plane who seek to be lifted up into Light. God bless you beloveds. I love you. I love you dearly. God bless you.
