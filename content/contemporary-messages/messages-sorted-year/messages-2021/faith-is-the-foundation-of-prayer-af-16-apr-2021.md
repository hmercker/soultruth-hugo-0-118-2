Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. It is the intensity and power of your faith that will hold you in the light. Without this sure and unshakeable feeling, understanding and knowing that you are with God and that your souls are in alignment with God, then you are not the clear and beautiful channels of God’s Love that you are meant to be? Indeed your mind continues to dampen your spirits, to convince you that those things of the material plane are the most important elements and focus of your life. Yet in this world of yours, you are aware of what is needed and what is required, and that is to forge your relationship with God. God does not insist that you do so. God does not make edicts or bargains with His children. God merely waits for your prayers and your focus upon Him through the awareness of your souls. 

So with faith you come to God. With faith you say your prayers, and with faith you call out God to bring blessings to your brothers and sisters and to yourself. Faith is the foundation of prayer and as you continue to pray and open yourselves to the great inflowing of God’s Divine Essence, His Love, so your faith grows. So that faith within you becomes solid ground from which you may build your spiritual life and to house those beautiful gifts that God has bestowed upon you. With faith these things flourish because faith brings forth the desires of your soul, awakening you to those deeper needs and desires that come from within you and which are expressive of your souls. With each day, with each moment, with all that is a gift to you with your life, so God will pour His blessings upon you given your openness, faith and desire to receive it.
 
Faith does not come from belief, faith comes from knowing and experiencing God. As you continue to experience God, day in and day out, over and over again, this strengthening bond that is created in love and desire, where faith strengthens and secures this bond within you, so you come to God in this beautiful outpouring of the soul ever seeking at-onement with God. In finding that at-onement, the fulfillment of the desire through receiving His Love, so you come to God in faithful supplication, in humble yet powerful desire to be His child, to walk with Him upon the avenues of light and joy, of knowledge and truth, of peace, and of light. These things come with the exercise of your faith combined with the desire of your soul to be with God. And so it shall be, beloved children. You shall gather and be a part of God’s great family of souls seeking ever closer at-onement, seeking the transformation of the soul, the awakening of the soul. It comes and your faith grows and you become truly redeemed, transformed and healed in love. 

May you continue upon this great journey, knowing that we are with you, and have faith that God protects and guides, and provides for your needs. So these things come as you continue to forge a relationship with your Creator. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine, and I am happy to see you all gathered today with love in your hearts, with faith within your soul, with all that is of goodness, all that is of God surrounding you, becoming a part of your life. God bless you. God bless you deeply. My love is with you all. God bless you.
