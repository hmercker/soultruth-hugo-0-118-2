# Describes the Tenderness of their Approach to Working with Us

Orion Project, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Orion & Jesus received by Al Fike

Greetings and blessings from your friend Orion. You are like the tender shoots that have emerged from the soil. You begin to grow in the light but in your present state, you are vulnerable to the forces that may trample you. So, we huddle close around you in protection, in a caring, loving, nurturing presence so that you may in time grow strong and fulfill your destinies as to what you are meant to be.

In time, we will bring our physical presence and technologies to your world but we do not wish to present powerful instruments that will awaken humanity to a world that is not yet ready for such an awakening. Could you imagine if all of you awakened at once? The screams of horror and outrage that will come from those who see the world as it truly is would be deafening. This trauma would be too much for many.

Even with you, my beloved friends, we awaken you slowly, gently so that the truth may dawn upon your consciousness in such a way that you are not shaken to your core for if you were allowed to awaken suddenly, there would be a deep sense of remorse and hopelessness in regard to the condition of your planet and all who dwell within it. Can you imagine what we perceive and your angel friends perceive as we travel from our places of light to this place that is so mottled in darkness and light that it is truly chaotic?

Yet, we persist because we see within every individual the great potentials that God has implanted within them. So, we persist with love because love is what empowers our efforts, both us from our place of residence and your angel friends.

Beloved souls, you open many doors for yourselves as you continue to pray and ask God to awaken you. So, this process, this road of awakening, is gradual and powerful. It does not require those technologies that we bring to do so. Though, we have been asked to assist you and assist you we do and we will as you continue to be awakened somewhat more swiftly than if you were to continue upon the road of prayer as the only avenue of awakening.

Unfortunately, time is of the essence. So therefore, we have been asked to engage with those instruments that will allow you to open and awaken more swiftly but not to the point where you are in shock. Some naively think that because they have prayed for the gift of this Love indeed they are very much in harmony with God’s laws pertaining to both the physical universe and the spiritual universe. But in truth, they too are little seedlings emerging from the ground and vulnerable.

The mind wishes to extrapolate and imagine that they are indeed very far along upon this path of the emerging soul. Certainly, in comparison to many upon this planet, you are far along this path. You have heard the encouragement of your angel friends who say that you are indeed in the light of truth, that the light of truth burns within your souls, that that light, the Light of Love, continues to awaken you and transform you. Of course, your angel friends are not saying that which is not true for it is true. But we see with all those who live upon the earthly plane patterns and behaviours and conditions that reflect this plane of life.

Within your minds, you are, in many ways, no different from others although you have a more loving and positive attitude toward life. This is certainly a powerful first step of development and evolution. To have the mind in alignment with the soul is what is needed. You have been told this, many times over the course of your development.

It is the mind that is the great barrier to awakening. The mind that is open to all the messages, both psychic and material, that invade your atmosphere and saturate it to such a degree that it is very difficult indeed to extract yourself from these conditions and to be more in harmony with your soul rather than have one foot within the light and truth of your soul and one foot within the reality, as you call it, of your mind.

Yet, this integration continues to take place. You are continuing to be willing participants in this process of realignment, of expunging error from your minds and your souls. Like any crop that the farmer wishes to nurture and succeed in their growth, so he fertilizes that crop with what it requires. You may look at us as farmers who are engaged in nurturing this beautiful crop of souls. We are here to ensure your survival, your vitality, the fruition of your growing souls in the light.

We will continue to do so until you pass into spirit and reach those planes of life that you have striven for and made a great effort to achieve. So, we are inextricably bonded and we have an agreement which was established some time before you knew of us between your souls and the forces of light and truth. God’s Will cements this agreement with love. We will continue to work on your behalf to help guard you against those dark forces that would extinguish this effort.

A seedling, when it first emerges from the ground, does not look much like what it will become in the future. Its structure is simple although its light is intense, full of the vitality of the energies of this Earth and the energies of love. So, you will come to realize who you are. You will come to see yourselves differently as you emerge and grow into that unique and beautiful soul that you are, becoming a part of God’s garden, flowering in all its uniqueness, beauty and light. In this, you will become a powerful agent of change in the world, an example of the next step for humanity in its journey and evolution toward harmony, light and love.

This will be the reward of our labours, both your stellar friends and your celestial friends. These rewards are great for us. It is not a trifling matter that we come and it is not something that we take casually or see as commonplace for this emergence of souls is what you would call a miracle taking place before our eyes. As you would see a seedling emerge and come to life, so it is for us to see you come to life and light, to grow and strengthen in the ways that God has set forth, for this to be.

To have many in your world awakening in this way will bring such a force for transformation and light and truth that much in your world that is resistant will capitulate to light, will come to see the power and truth of what you have become, the wonderment of a beautiful soul moving in the world in love, guided by God, surrounded by angels, beings of light. This will give many hope and will inspire many to follow that road toward light.

In that decision within the lost souls to do so, they will draw to them the beautiful angels and beings of light that are all too eager to assist them upon the journey. God’s plan is emerging and you will continue to see with greater clarity your part within it. We urge you to continue in your prayers to receive the great gift that is the key to all that is intended, the Essence of God infilling your soul, that soul that has an eternal capacity to receive it and to grow with it.

So, you will emerge, my friends, in beautiful ways. You will be wondrous creatures filled with love, expressing the great potentials that lie within you. This power of love will emerge and be expressed in ways that you cannot imagine at this time. But this comes, as we continue to march forward step by step upon this path. We are close. Your angel friends are close. We continue to guide and monitor, to protect, and to be your friends upon this journey.

May God truly, truly touch your souls so very deeply that all responds in joy and love. Our prayers are with you, my friends. The prayers of many, many are with you. May you continue to awaken. May you continue to find your way. The path will be lit. The way will be bright. Joy will be in your heart forever.

May God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. My love is with you all. Blessings to you. Blessings always.

I confirm my friend. I am **Jesus**. He speaks words of truth. He is truly our friend in the universe. He represents the high intentions and desires of those who continue to grow and awaken in the blessings of love and light that God has for all His children that are scattered throughout the universe.

We are but one of many thousands of places, planets, environments in which God has seeded through the vastness of eternal space. So, we are fortunate to have our friends come from such distance to assist us in this great effort to awaken humanity. All efforts are being made to awaken your brothers and sisters, so many who are lost and unable to see their way. So, you must be their eyes and ears, my friends. We, together, must work towards the awakening of humanity.

May you awaken with each day, a little further, a little more so that you may truly be powerful instruments of God’s Will and blessings for the world. There is great unity here, great unity amongst all of us. The power of that unity is a great lever to open the door of truth, to inspire many to come to God to receive the gift of His Love.

May you continue to grow and strengthen, my friends. Do not succumb to the earthly conditions that may bring you to that place where you feel distant from us and from God and from your own soul. With earnest prayer and longing, you will find yourself back with God and all that that gives to you in light and love and peace, protection. It is a constant struggle upon your earthly plane but it is a noble struggle, one that you must persist and be committed to.

We are with you always, my friends, my beloveds, never to leave. Be close as we long for you to be close. Be in harmony with God as we pray that you will be. Be in the light, the light of truth and the truth of love. May God bless you, beloved friends, beloveds, beloveds. I love you. God bless you.
