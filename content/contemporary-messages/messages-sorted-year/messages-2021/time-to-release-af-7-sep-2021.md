May God’s breath of love be upon you, my precious and beloved friends. I am Keea-atta Kem. So, you have tasted the power of the dark room. You have come together affirming your kinship with one another, your souls yearning for greater awakening and greater truth, your minds thirsting to move forward in your development and the opening of these gifts. You are indeed linking together in a form of unity and light that is most beneficial for the work that we are doing together.

It is important now that you release those things that are not conducive to these efforts. Many of these things are hidden within you but they will emerge to your consciousness because the power of your prayers, your group, the blessings of God upon you, the presence of your angel friends, and the many others who are working with this group will ensure that those elements that are not in harmony with love, with purity, with harmony will emerge within you. 

It is your responsibility as has been mentioned to become aware and to allow the healing of those disharmonious parts of you, so to bring greater harmony. When you allow these things to fall away, when you are open to God’s Touch and healing upon you, you are doing a service not only to yourself but to your group, you are adding greater light, you are walking on a higher plane, you are allowing God more freely to move and bless and bring the unfolding Light of His Love into every part of your being, every aspect of who you are. As this Love continues to touch these parts of you, so you will know the upliftment, the joy, the freedom that comes with the power of love. 

Each time you come together you are declaring yourself. You are a testimony to the wonderment of this truth. You are opening that door so that God may enter and that the angels of God may come close. Pray as often as you can. Seek this gift of Love and healing, of harmony and peace to come within yourself and grow and expand, pushing aside those barriers and disharmonious elements so that you may truly find your freedom and that we together may find our way along this path of development and manifestation.
It is the way of this world of yours that many hide from the truth of their own condition. They cannot look. They are fearful. They do not wish to be exposed and vulnerable in a harsh world. Yet, here you are amongst friends. You are in a place of light. You are not condemned for those things you consider to be flaws. Rather, your friends gaze upon you with compassion and understanding. 

The act of prayer which beseeches God to heal your soul and all conditions that are with you, that are encrustations upon your soul with the Touch of His Love is indeed an act of courage and responsibility for each of you desires to bring the truth to humanity. But for it to be so with deep commitment and example, you must first walk in the light in such a way that these deep inhibitions and conditions are released. Few truly desire to travel this road. Few truly understand what it is that holds them from God. You have elected to open your eyes and open yourself in order to see those things so truly hidden and  have been empowered by your act of ignoring and not acknowledging their existence. 

You cannot consider continuing with this cloaking of the truth within you. Rather, you must strip away these coverings and see your true self with the eyes of compassion and love, understanding that every child who walks this world has been injured in some way and often in many ways. But I do not encourage you, my beloved friends, to dwell upon these things and build a shrine to your own pain. Rather, in the way of God’s Love, it is that quick release that comes with acknowledgment and prayer, the healing of your soul and all that inhibits your soul may be released in a moment of true prayer and desire to have these things vanquished from your consciousness, from yourself. God’s compassion and Love and healing Touch upon you is great. But it is often your minds that hold on and feel that it is of such great importance to acknowledge your pain, not only to yourselves but to others. 

Beloved souls, it is time to be free, to release your burdens and to come to God in that purity of light, that condition of love, that beauty that is your own soul unencumbered by the human condition. In this way, you may step forward as true and clear channels of His Love, of being a true instrument, an instrument with gifts that are profound and powerful given to you by God at your very creation, these things that desire awakening and expression but are often distorted and held from true light and beauty by the dreadful conditions that you have accumulated through a life’s journey.

I urge you to walk in freedom, to pray in earnest, to say that I have had my fill of this pain and I wish to be released not just from a mind’s perspective, from truly the soul’s desire. When that depth of desire and yearning comes from the soul and is truly laid before God, then you are ready to be released from these shackles and come to know the joy and freedom of a soul redeemed in Love. 

This is your great challenge, beloved souls. It is the challenge of every soul that walks this Earth, but you have come to know truth. You have come to know the great lever that will break these shackles, the power of love that will heal the wounds, the wisdom that comes with a soul awakening and understanding truly its purpose, its being, and its relationship with its Creator. Such joy you will feel. Such joy will be with us in the Celestial Kingdom as we observe the new birth of your soul through the healing and transformation that comes with the Father’s Love.

May God bless you on this journey. Know that you are surrounded by friends, friends on the Earth, friends in the world of spirit, friends everywhere you look who are eager to be with you in the birthing of you soul. May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea-atta Kem and I am with you in this struggle, in your pain. I am with you in your joy and your awakening. I am with you in all of these things that are a part of life and a part of your soul’s growth. May we share this wonderment of the soul emerging and finding its place with God. God bless you. My love is with you all. God bless you, beloved souls. I love you.
