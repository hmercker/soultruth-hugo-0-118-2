# Closing Message for Retreat

September 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Orion received by Al Fike

...a privilege to serve such earnest souls who are seeking for a better world and seeking to better themselves in that world. A privilege because you have contributed to your world in such a way that a turning point has been reached and new possibilities have been opened. You give us great joy to see how you, in your efforts, have brought such a great response in God’s universe.

You are now truly connected, my friends, in every way. Utilize these connections, and God will utilize these connections so that when you are used as a channel, as an instrument in the world, so you have your friends to back you up, as you would say, to be with you in your efforts.

So you have multiplied your strengths, your gifts, your beings in light to such an extent that whatever you put your hand to, given it is guided and in harmony with God’s Will, the effects and outcomes will be far greater than they were. You now work as a single body, although you are certainly individual, you now act in harmony with the great light that has been established. You are beings of light, instruments of light, bringers of light, and much will come of this.

We will not leave you, my friends. We only just begin a relationship that will go on and intensify. In relations with your Celestial angels, we work together, will do so in ever greater increments, dedications, levels of awareness, beautiful discoveries together, beloved souls. Be blessed and joyful, for you have overcome much and gained much upon this journey that will go on and on in light.

God bless you, beloved souls. May God bless you deeply, profoundly, powerfully, in extraordinary ways, in beautiful ways. The Touch of Love will bring all these things and more. Our love is with you. Our wish is for all that is meant to be and all that will be, live within our hearts as it does in yours. God bless you. I am Orion.
