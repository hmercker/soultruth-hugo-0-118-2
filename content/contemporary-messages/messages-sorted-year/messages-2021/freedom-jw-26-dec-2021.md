I am here, Care. Everyone in the world wants freedom, and perhaps freedom means different things in different places. On the material level, it might be freedom from worrying about money, quality of life, clean water, air, freedom of education, or not. On the spiritual level, what is freedom? As someone who spent the early part of their lives being subservient, I found myself lifted in prayer with a sense of freedom that gave me courage to step out, knowing it is better to be free than under the thumb of another. 
  
My beloved and I, we experienced much freedom in our travels, in our daily lives and with our children. Most importantly to me was the freedom to pray, to make music, to create, to be in nature. 
   
All beings who have souls need freedom and you know, we never interfere in the great gift of free will. 
    
I tell you this with all the love in my heart, that when you ask for whatever it is you need, when your asking is in harmony with the Laws of God, with the progression of soul, with your physical or material needs, you shall receive. 
   
Consider freedom in all these areas, and know the joy, the exhilaration, and ultimately, the glory of being free in Godâ€™s Love. Each soul, a unique creation, as you are. 
  
I am here for you, please remember that. With all my love in the Holy Blessings of the Creator, I wish you a very blessed journey in the New Year with many changes in harmony, guided and blessed. There are no wrong choices made in Love. And I love you. I am Care.
