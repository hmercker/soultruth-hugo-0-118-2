# It is Simple

I am your friend and brother in the love of God, Yogananda. I come in this peace to this circle of light and wonderful inflowing of God’s love into each soul. As you allow your souls to open and your hearts to be in the place of safety and the embrace of our loving Creator, it is the longing before the words that reaches God, who showers you in an effulgence of light with the great blessing of His love. 

The only requirement, if I may use that word, is to allow your heart to open that God may touch your soul. It is not a material question, it is not an intellectual understanding, it is not a detachment, but an engaging with your longing, your feeling, your need, with God’s gift. I have said before as many have, that is is so simple yet amidst the complications of this world it appears to be a difficult task. It is a letting go and opening, a simple request really, that brings a magnificent response. 

As you sit here in this circle of light, attended by a multitude unseen, feel the Love, bask in the light and Grace that is yours for the asking. Every good , every perfect gift, comes in the love of God. Every blessing will be yours if you allow it. This is your free will. To be in harmony with the will of God, is your choice. Have no regrets as you walk into a glorious future on the Celestial path, each one a precious child of God, so beloved. May every soul here receive this gift. 

I shall step back and join you in this peace that does indeed pass human understanding. All glory to God. I am your brother and friend, Yogananda. God bless you.
