# Comes to Pray with Us

June 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Vancouver Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloveds, I am your brother and your friend Jesus. I come because you have thought of me and drawn me in with your intentions and your prayers. I come because my ministry has never ceased upon this Earth, though there are times when what I brought has been obscured greatly by the thoughts and intentions of humanity. Nonetheless I have come through all of these ages of time to be with my brothers and sisters upon the Earth and shall continue to do so until all spirits and all mortals are uplifted into light and truth, whether they enter into the realms of the natural love in heaven or into the Celestial Heavens. I will continue in my work as do many in the spirit spheres and the Celestial Kingdom, for this is our goal, our great effort and guided intention by God to uplift humanity beyond the mundane and the conditions that are so prevalent in your world, that this world may once again walk in light, that this world may be healed, that this world may expand in light, that all within it will be in harmony with God's laws, that they will come to know the great potential of their natural love and capacity to love, and that of the Divine Love awakening the soul and all blessings and wonderments and potentials of each individual soul. For, there is so much that is undiscovered and unrealized in your world. There is so much that requires your attention and the attention of all upon it in order to make that progress real, in order that all may come into greater light and truth.

Over the eons of time, leaders have come and gone in your world who have taught those things of light and love, and humanity continues to only hear with one ear and to follow their own desires and condition with the other. It is time to release this inclination towards those things that are not of God and not of creation. It is time to release the pain within each individual and to unshackle the capacity to love, to truly love your brothers and sisters. For, so much depends upon the individual who is willing to go beyond that condition that keeps them from loving, from seeing the world, seeing themselves, seeing all that God has created in the way that is of light and truth and love.

We pray together, beloved souls, because each of us has the intention to help this world emerge from darkness, to help each individual to come to light, to be a channel of light in the world, to forge this great connection between yourself and God in a clear, unambiguous and powerful flow of love. With God's Touch upon each of us, our souls may open to all of these blessings, so that we are indeed in alignment with truth and have the conscious awareness of God's Presence with us.

Much can be accomplished by those who walk in faith, who live the truth of this love, who are true to themselves and true to God. We are all God's teachers, God's healers, God's children of love and light. May each of us carry through the greatest and clearest of intentions, awakening all that is within us, these great potentials of our souls so that God may utilize us as clear channels upon the world. We are His instruments, we are His channels. See yourself as such, beloved souls. Do not deny yourself the great blessing of His Love at anytime, but seek it with all your heart, all your soul, awakening to His great blessing, knowing Him as only your soul may know, seeing Him as only the faculties of your soul may recognize God, feeling His Love as only your soul longs and desires for that Touch.

You are His children. We are brothers and sisters all, upon this magnificent world of His Creation. Let the error fall away, let that which clouds your insight, your knowledge, that which is within your soul, dissipate in the great light of God's Love, that these myths of error, these things not of love may be burnt away by God Touch of Love. We are His children and we are together in this great journey of awareness, of growth, of transformation, of truth, that love shall guide us all, beloved souls. Love shall be our foundation. Love shall be that which we apply with each and every aspect of our lives and ourselves, and through us love will flourish, through us light will change the world.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother. I am with you, never to leave, beloveds. My love for you is great. Our love for God is even greater. May we come to know that love is our time, our place, our expression, our motivation, our effort, our being, all these things lit by the power of love. May God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. I am Jesus. My love is with you, always.
