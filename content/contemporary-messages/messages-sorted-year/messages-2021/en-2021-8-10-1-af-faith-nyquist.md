Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Faith Nyquist received by Al Fike

The peace that surpasses all understanding be with you, my beloved brothers and sisters. I am Faith. I thank you, my sister, for praying for that place far off that is in need of your prayers. I thank all of you for praying for the world, for indeed the world is in need of your prayers, your ministrations of love, your light, and all gifts that you carry. These things are greatly needed in your world.

As you are with God, may you feel the joy in your heart that comes with God’s Touch in your soul for that joy and upliftment is a great tonic to the woes of the world. God does not wish for His children to walk glum and worried and concerned for all that is wrong in your world. It is when you carry light and you are lightened by joy that you are the most powerful instrument of God's Touch.

Yes, there are many woes in the world. I stepped forward many times and challenged the beliefs of the Catholic Church, but I also asked to be guided each day. Often God would bring to me many individuals from the spirit world who were in need of a blessing. So, I was used in many different ways to bring light to many different souls. My gift was that of vision. I could see and hear and know the presence of spirits and also know the conditions of those around me. Many sought out my wisdom and counselling to help them spiritually.

I did many things while on Earth that reached many souls to uplift them and in my efforts and hopes to bring joy to their hearts. Beloved souls, you too can bring joy to the hearts of others. Whether they be in the flesh or in spirit, there are many who are drawn to you. It is a great gift to answer God's call, to bring the blessings of His Love and Light into the room which you are conversing and communing in light.

Many spirits gather around us at this very moment. Many angels are also present. They are blessing those around you and blessing you, beloved souls. May you be open, open wide to God’s Touch, God's Love flowing into your souls, and that in this you may feel the great joy of your heart and the great love for humanity that comes when God is with us and His deep peace envelops us.

We are in the light together. That is an important lesson for the world, for groups to gather in light and pray for the world, pray for themselves, pray for their families and their loved ones, for all who are in need. Indeed, all are in need of a blessing. Remember this, beloved souls, you can affect a blessing in the world if you pray and ask God to use you as his instruments. Just as I prayed each day, so if you do you will find that God will guide the many to you and that there will be a blessing given.

You will know it and feel it and be a part of this beautiful gift that God bestows upon those individuals who are open and eager to receive. Beloved souls, may you see yourself as God’s channels, God’s beautiful lights in the world and utilize your gifts for the benefit of many.

You are a gift to the world. You are unique and beautiful, filled with light. Be that gift beloved souls, be that beautiful light and know that God is with you in the light. God bless you, my beautiful friends, and keep you in His protection and light and joy. God bless you. I am Faith. My love is with you all. God bless you. God bless you.
