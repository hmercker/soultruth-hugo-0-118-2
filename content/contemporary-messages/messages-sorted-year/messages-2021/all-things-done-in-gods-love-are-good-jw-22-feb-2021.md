# All Things Done in God’s Love are Good

I am here your brother and friend in the love of God.  I am Yogananda. Be at peace. Let your hearts open that God may touch your souls so that those things that have bound you to the earth and kept you from rising above it, be dissolved in the great love of God, and that your soul may be at one with the Creator. 

All things which done in the Grace of God, in that state of love, are good. When you release your mind and allow your soul to be lifted and awakened, and your heart to be healed in God’s light and love, you cannot err. Though the reaction to what you do may surprise you, consider for a moment the Master Jesus, who did all things in grace, in the love of God and touched so many and continues to do so. And yet, while on earth, the reaction of those who could not see, and could not open their hearts, was one that cost him his life. I do not wish to frighten anyone with that comment but rather to support your hearts desire to be without fear, to be in peace, the peace above human understanding, the peace that allows you to just be, love.  

To be a vehicle for the light and love of the Creator is a great gift. When you feed another soul with the gift of God’s love you do a mighty work, a blessed thing. For these gifts are offered in deep empathy with the state of humankind where your heart is opened and wishing to be a blessing to all. You may notice, or you may have noticed, that in ashrams and in monasteries and spiritual centers, the homeless and the hungry are often fed, given shelter, and clothing. That too, is a great gift, and yet to feed a soul with the love that is eternal, to touch one in God’s grace, that is magnificent. That is selfless love of the highest order. This is the love we bring to your circle as God showers you, we too, join in this great blessing. 

I say all things done in God’s love are good no matter choices you make, no matter what your plans may be, you will be aligned with the Creator and the blessings will flow. I will step back now and join you in silent prayer. May all here be blessed in the love of God.  I am Yogananda. Go in peace.
