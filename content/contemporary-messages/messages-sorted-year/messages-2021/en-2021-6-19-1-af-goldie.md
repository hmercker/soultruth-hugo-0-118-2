Goldie received by Al Fike

I like the idea of a celebration, I am Goldie. Indeed, anything that brings joy, I like, I like it very much. This you must do, my friends, this you must do, bring joy wherever you go. Do not take yourselves so seriously that joy and humor and good will is not a part of everything that you do, for is not life the potential to bring greater joy? Is not what God has given us all a great opportunity to be in light, to be uplifted and lighter in our lives?

Blessed are the joy givers and the joy keepers and the joy expressers! Blessed are all of you in the Light of joy and love. I love you all.Blessed are you, my friends, for you have very beautiful friends in the angels of God. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I love you. I find you funny sometimes and I love you. God bless you, I love you.
