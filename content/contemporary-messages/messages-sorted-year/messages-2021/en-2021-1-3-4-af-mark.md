# New Year Address at First Spiritualist Church

January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2021

First United Spiritualist Church, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mark received by Al Fike

I am Mark, the guardian of your church. The one who works with all of you to bring greater light to your lives, to your beings. It is in the nourishing of your light, the nourishing of your souls, that you will find a great capacity and opportunity to serve your brothers and sisters in times to come.

God will provide all the ways and means to awaken you, to bring you into harmony, to show you the way towards greater light, to awaken your gifts so that you may serve humanity with beautiful and deep abilities to bring truth, to bring comfort and healing, love and joy to all you meet. This will come into you and emanate from you, provided you desire this and that you go to God to receive His gift of Love. In this way you will be strengthened, you will know light and you will be at peace and know great joy.

It is simple, know that your church will be a sanctuary, will continue to uphold you, and that the angels are working with all of you who are in the light and will draw in many into your church for it is a refuge from the dark conditions within your world. It will bring peace and sustenance to many and it is a gift from God. May you continue to uphold this beautiful church, uphold those desires within your soul to bring light and to be light, to give light, to express light.

May God bless you on that journey, beloveds. I am Mark and I walk with you all as you continue to experience the wonderment of life. God bless you, God bless you deeply.
