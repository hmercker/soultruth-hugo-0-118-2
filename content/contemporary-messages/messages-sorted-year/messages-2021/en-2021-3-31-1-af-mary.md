# We Are With You Always on This Journey

March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2021

General Collection, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mary received by Al Fike

A blessing of peace for you, beloveds, I am Mary. I come to bring my blessing of love for you all and that you are surrounded by your angel friends who come to pray with you. Each time you come together in this way, so we are drawn, so we are happy and joyous with the opportunity to pray with you for the blessing of God's Love. So it comes as a great shower of light, a beautiful sense of peace and you are enwrapped in this light, uplifted in this light and your souls are open to the inflowing of its essence, changing you ever so slightly, changing you as you continue to journey upon this Divine path.

Be at peace, beloveds, and know that we are with you, always with you on this journey of love. God bless you. My love is with you. We are all with you tonight in your prayers. God bless you.
