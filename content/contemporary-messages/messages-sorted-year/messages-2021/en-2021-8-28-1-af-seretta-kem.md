Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. The time grows short and we are pleased that you are making your plans to gather together and that those who cannot be here in the flesh are committed to being supportive in prayer. Having this support from as many as are able will help to bring the conditions and energies together for the benefit of this development group.

Each of you will bring certain elements that are unique to your individual gifts and even physicality that will assist in this development and the awakening of these gifts. Each of you feel drawn and are committed to the efforts that we are making together. As such, you will be deeply blessed within these efforts.

Whatever inconveniences may come in your life, there will be a multiplication of bles-sings that will come as a result of your efforts, not only to yourself but to your families. When there is a small sacrifice given by an individual to God, there is always a multi-plication of blessings in return. This is indeed a reflection of God’s bounteous love for His children. God will endeavour to ensure that you are blessed in light, blessed in abundance, blessed in your efforts, and blessed in harmony in your life. These things will come to those who are in alignment with God.

In this deep alignment comes many manifestations and blessings that may seem sub-tle to you but are important in the world as manifestations of light and love which help disperse the darkness. Together you will be a great beacon of light, a force of light that will help to disperse much darkness and bring many blessings to many others. You carry all those who are within your life as you come together.

Those who are in this circle of your life will be blessed. Together you multiply these blessings, the power of the light, the power of your channel for God to bless His child-ren. For though you are the active agents, those who are connected to you are the be-neficiaries of your efforts. Your prayers will open up avenues of light and blessings for your loved ones and for many whom you work with during your day and your friends who are connected.

This multiplication factor will spread wide into the world as you grow in light, as you grow in the power of your gifts and the blessings of God upon you. So, it will have a ripple effect with those around you and those around them and so on, spreading in a wide arc as a blessing for many, many souls. This is also a factor and benefit of your gathering that many souls will benefit from your prayers and much will be accomplis-hed through your prayers.

Beloved souls, you come close to this great journey, a journey that will ensure a mea-sure of awakening within you and ensure transformative effects upon you and within you. You are being given a great gift, a great gift indeed. May you all come with antici-pation, deep desire, and excitement of the soul to gather and commune and express your deep desires to God. This Circle of Light will be powerful and express God’s Will in ways that are not often seen in your world.

Each of you bring a component, an aspect that is vital to the whole of your circle and body of participants. These elements have a physical component, a spiritual compo-nent, and a soulful component. As they come together, it is like a fission of elements that will create a wondrous response and reaction in the world. We gather together soon and we will accomplish much, my beloved, beloved friends.

We prepare ourselves for the coming times. We work together with you to continue in your preparations and your efforts to be in harmony, to be in light and love, to be God’s instruments together communing and part of a wondrous venture. Beloved souls, may you be blessed in the coming days. May you truly come to see the opportunity that has been laid before you. May your souls jump with joy for indeed, you have come to fulfill a purpose, a deep purpose that is a part of each one of you. To fulfill a part of your being upon this world at this time that will bring great joy to you, a great sense of ful-fillment, understanding of the deep and wondrous Will of God and the unfolding of His plan.

May God bless you, beloveds. May God be with you as you continue to discover the wonderment of God’s Presence in your life and God’s Essence within your soul. We are with you. We will be close in these coming days. I would say that all of you will feel that closeness recognize our presence to some degree. May God’s blessings continue to flow upon you, beloved, beloved friends. May you be in the Light of God with every breath as you continue to prepare yourselves for your gathering.

God bless you. I am Seretta Kem and I am with you, with you all. God bless you.
