# Ask in Prayer and You shall Receive

November 19<sup>th</sup>, 2021 

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



My dear friends I come in the Grace of God, in the Love of God to this holy communion of blessed souls. You that come together a community of prayer, a union of souls, are coming together to receive the love of God and knowing the magnitude of this effort joining together the family of Divine love where all are One. I can tell you when you gather together with singularity of purpose you bring a force that cannot be denied, as you are shining a beam of light in the darkness. We who live in realms of light attracted to your prayer are glad to come and be in this community with you. To give whatever guidance we can, whatever encouragement with the love of our souls. 

In my time I witnessed firsthand what could be created by following the guidance of the angels in communion with God. Many came in service and as one community we were able to create something greater than ourselves that over time drew thousands. And though that thread has been somewhat lost, and the light somewhat diminished you can know that the template of prayer that was able to inspire so many, this template is a worthwhile one to adapt in whatever endeavors you embark on. Ask in prayer and you shall receive. Follow your guidance, know you are protected. Know that we walk with you.

I wish to give a special embrace to my friend Susan and her Michael<sup>1</sup> that you may all of you, that I am a Celestial and I live in the Kingdom of God’s love. And to all here in this lattice of light in this bubble of God’s love where you open to the inflowing and infilling of His Essence, may you stay in Grace, walk in Love, and grow, for the earth so needs you and I thank you. May God bless each one of you and your beautiful community that is a church without walls. I am your sister in the love of God. I am Eileen Caddy. Go in Peace. Go in Grace.
