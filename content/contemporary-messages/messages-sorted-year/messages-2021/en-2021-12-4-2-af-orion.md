# Addresses Alliance of Light Panel Discussion of the Crystal Gift

Orion received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Orion. I am happy to see all of you here with your questions and curiosities, with your affirmation and experiences that have brought to you an openness to what it is that we are here to give, to share with you. As our dear sister has said, it is in love that we give. It is love that makes it possible for us to be with you and to give whatever assistance we can to uplift you.

If you do not feel love when you are sensing a presence close to you, then I would suggest that you question who is with you. It is the power of love, the signature of love, the light of love that brings the blessings that are meant to be given. It is God working through His instruments whether they be upon your earthly plane, whether they be in the spirit world or the Celestial Heavens, or from our world. It is love that makes this connection possible. It is this alignment with light that is important and a signal that you must perceive for yourself in order to open the possibilities of this connection, the many efforts, the many reaching hands that are stretched out toward each one of you.

We desire to assist all who are willing and who want to be a channel for light, love, and change in the world. It is for you to accept our assistance or not. We do not force our way into your world, into your personal world. We come with humility and with love. We come because we see in many of you a light. In this, you are igniting a powerful process that will bring greater light and transformation within you. It is this transformative energy, this transformative blessing of love that will change your world. We merely come to reinforce and affirm this truth. It is in your relationship with the Creator of All that will bring the answers that you seek and will bring the great light that we speak of. We are merely here as your friends to help reinforce this desire that originates from your soul for your own personal awakening, for the forging of an alliance between yourself and God, that your soul may be awakened, that light may be your life and your reality, and that light may spread in the world.

If you wish to receive this gift and many of you here already have this gift, then you may merely ask in your prayers and your thoughts. Surely this gift will be given because it is meant to assist all who are engaged in this search and this journey toward the light. It is merely another tool. It is not the key to light for you already know the key to light, the great Divine Love of God. But it is something that is an adjunct to this blessing that will help to uplift and sustain you, to help speed up the process of transformation and connecting within you, those parts of you that are disconnected, that soul within you that has so much potential. Yet much of it continues to languish and is unused.

So, we walk with you, my friends, in a loving partnership, in a desire to see another world awakened in light, that the great shift toward all that which is in harmony with what God has created may take place and that you will know a world that is a beautiful, joyful, wondrous place where the needs of your soul, the needs of your body, the needs of your mind are realized and are in harmony with what God has created.

May you each find your way toward harmony, my friends. There is little standing in your way. There is a great deal of support and help offered, not only from us but from many. May you come to realize how precious each of you is, how wondrous you are, and how much potential you each hold within you. After all, you are a creation of God and God has created something magnificent, wondrous, and beautiful. May you reflect this with your journey each day. May you come to see the universe as it truly is, a magnificent place teeming with life, with possibility. May you come to know the truth that is Love and Love is the power that gives motion, awakening, gives what we have created its ability to change you, to change all in the universe for the better.

All that which is empowered by love is an agent of change. It is a gift. It is a blessing. I hope that you will come to see this and be open to all that is empowered by love, that you may see beyond the limited views of so many in your world, and come to open yourself to the greater world, the greater reality which is God’s universe. We will all come to know each other as brothers and sisters in God’s universe. May you see yourself as truly a part of all that is. May the oneness continue to grow within you all, that unity, that joy, that power of love.

Thank you for listening to me today. Thank you for listening to our speakers who have shared their experiences. May you continue to delve into these things and find the greater truths that are awaiting you. May God bless you deeply in your souls, my friends. The great universal Love of God, may it change you and heal you and bring greater light to you. Blessings to you, my friends. I am Orion. I am here and I am dedicated to helping the world to be a place of light and harmony and love. Blessings to you, my friends.
