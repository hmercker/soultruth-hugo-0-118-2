Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

May God bless you deeply with His Love. I am Seretta Kem. It is good that you gather together in this way with consistency and with a sense of purpose and desire within your soul and your minds. You find that you will be very blessed by these gatherings as we continue to unify, to incorporate all that has been given, to integrate, to be in harmony with God’s Will and Love. These things will continue to flow into each one, through each one, and amongst you in great light.

So, we enter a new phase of this work and this development circle. You will find yourselves questioning many things in this phase of development for it is just as important to re-think and re-integrate within the mind various ideas and concepts as it is to awaken the soul. For a soul awakened without a mind that follows and is a part of this new knowledge and wisdom, capacity for love and light, there will a great contradiction within you. You must integrate, become whole within yourselves all that is true to truly live the Laws of Love, to be pure in your thoughts and your actions, to be guided by God.

This you cannot do completely and holy at this time. But as you strive towards you, as you continue to integrate those things within you that have been given, that are a result of the blessings of the great inflow of Divine Love within you, so you will find your way and so your expressions, your thoughts, your deeds will be in greater harmony with God. It must come reflexively as you grow in the light and the light informs who you are and what you do. So much comes with these many blessings that are given freely to each of you.

I urge you to not ignore the promptings, these new and emerging perceptions and thoughts that are coming to you. Rather, embrace them fully. Embrace them in love. Come to realize that you are changing and that the goal is that you become a changed individual, one that has embraced higher truth, greater love, and more light, that your souls continue to be transformed in God’s Love, that your beings continue to absorb more light, and that your minds open in earnest reflection of what is true and what is given in truth.

There is so much for you to do yet, beloved souls. This process of integration is a very deep and somewhat tedious task that requires your focus and your concentration. It requires that when you fall back into old patterns of thought and behaviour that you are well aware that you are not in harmony with love and light, to recognize and catch this shift in behaviour and thought and bring yourself back to the harmony of love. It is also a test, beloved souls, a test of your commitment, a test of your ability to be in alignment with God and to follow God’s Will, to express yourself in alignment with His Laws of Love.

In this Earth plane of yours, these things are not readily accomplished but will come as you persist, as you practice, as you accept, as you learn to love yourself and all those around you. Each day, you are releasing a little bit of your human self and accepting and integrating the Divine within you which is the Love of God awakening you.

May it be the focus of your life and may you not fall back into old ways. As you are in your familiar homes and lives, the challenge is great. But as you overcome, the rewards will be even greater. May you continue upon the Divine Path, the path where Love is the answer to all the dilemmas and situations and aspects of your life which need harmonization and expression of truth and love. So, it will be given, beloved souls. God uplifts you. The angels and all those who are a part of this great venture are with you. It is only your will, your desire to be out of sync and out of harmony with this new way of being that will circumvent all that is meant to be in your lives.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. I am with you as always. I am with you as are the angels of Heaven. All that is of light and goodness, all that is in harmony with God’s Will is with you. May you feel that strength and support, that love and joy. May you know within yourself what is in harmony and what is truly upon the path that has been laid before you. May you know and find the joy within your heart and be in alignment with all that is within you and all that God wishes to give to you. May God bless you, beloved souls. May God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
