I am your brother and friend, Arthur Conan Doyle. I come because I have great interest in any project that conveys truth to humanity and connects with the Celestial world and the angels whether it be a book or play, a song, a film, or even a dance. There are many ways to reach out and touch the world with the truth of God’s Love. 

I know you have projects afoot and I will gladly assist for as you know I was a bit of a writer myself. Also, I had the mind of a detective and I put this into my characters Sherlock and Dr. Watson in my writings yet, in my personal life, I was profoundly attracted to and interested in the spirit world. As you may know, I befriended Reverend Owen, supported his work, and joined him on his journey later on. To this day we are still brothers in Christ. 

These friendships that you create with people on your path of Divine Love, which is also my path and those who come through you, these will endure on the strength of the intentions of each soul reaching out to its Creator for oneness, At-One-ment, transformation. I could say it is imperative to fulfill these tasks you have set yourself to carry out and I speak to all here and all who may be privy to this message. It does take aligning your will with a higher purpose, activating your energies, and in your case, much prayer so that you will be guided every step of the way. For this is your deep desire within each one of you to serve. When you allow as you do, for guidance to come through, for us to speak through you, you create a doorway for many to enter. This doorway is an open heart. This leads to the longings of each soul to be healed, to be changed. 
The wonders I have seen on my journey in spirit have confirmed everything I aspired to and so much more. Wonders that we all attempt to describe to you and however we may fall short of that, our desire is to give you a glimpse of what awaits. As each one of you does your own detective work and goes into prayer, the wonders of God’s Love and His Kingdom uncover themselves in the appropriate fashion and in the unique way for each soul to receive. 

There is much work to do for each one in their own way and we come to you to bring you energy, guidance, inspiration, and whatever loving influence we can bestow upon you whilst respecting your free will. So, journey on with us in this beautiful, on this beautiful path leading to the eternal realms of God’s Love. 

With all my love and blessings and on behalf of all your Celestial friends, brothers and sisters who delight in your work, on behalf of the Kingdom, God bless you. I am your brother and friend in the love of God and your guide, I am Arthur Conan Doyle. Shine a light.
