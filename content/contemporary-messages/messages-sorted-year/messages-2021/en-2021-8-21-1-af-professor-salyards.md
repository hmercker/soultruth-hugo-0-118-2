Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

You have all done well, my friends, I am Professor Salyards. I would recommend that you take a break because I know that you are engaged in other projects, important projects. That break will serve to refresh you when you return to your tasks at hand and come with renewed perspectives and understanding of your efforts together.

Of course, with each day you are growing incrementally towards greater soul awareness and blessings within your soul. This will serve your well. You may rest upon your laurels at this time, my friends, knowing that you have made great progress from the time when this concept was conceived by our dear friend who contacted you in order to see if these ideas may come to fruition. And so they are indeed well along the way.

The fruits of your labors have not quite ripened, but indeed they hang from the tree and are ripening in the warmth and sunlight of God's Love. You will find when the time is right that you will be able to pluck this fruit and share it with many who are seeking the wisdom and truth of love. Everything has its own time and ideas and guidance need time to come to fruition. It is important to be patient and to allow the rhythm and flow of God's Will and guidance to manifest. In this way then all that is constructed will come together in harmony and that what you will present to the world will be something very enticing and beautiful and profound in what can be given to enhance the lives of others and to bring the truth to the soul of others.

So much comes through your step by step progress and awakening. And applying the truth that you know and the understandings that come with the soul firmly awakening to truth so that all that unfolds is in joy and love, harmony and peace. This is your indication that you are upon the right path and the right track in terms of your thinking and doing. Allow the Will of God to unfold in your life in every way so that harmony will ensue, that what you accomplish in a day will please God and be in harmony with His laws.

May love be infused in all of your efforts. May joy come from these efforts, a sense from the soul that all is well and all unfolds in harmony with God's Will and those things you are learning as you continue to progress in your efforts together. Indeed, that understanding will grow and your approach will evolve as your souls evolve in love. It will become easier, my friends. The challenges will melt away and the accomplishments will grow as you continue to work together in beloved, beloved harmony and truth.

May God bless you, my friends. Enjoy your time together, enjoy a bit of freedom from the responsibilities that have been laid upon you. Enjoy life and be with God always. God bless you, beloveds, I am Professor Salyards. I am happy to be with you today and shall continue. Remember that when we are in the spirit world together communicating and planning and enjoying the insights that each has to give that much is accomplished in this way so that indeed the progress that is being made and will continue to be made will not be interrupted, but will continue on a different level. In this way your insights will come in dreams and in meditations, insights and revelations as you pray.

May God bless you on the journey of awakening. May you find yourself at peace and be in joyful company with your brothers and sisters as you continue to listen to the Word of God, the Will of God, the Love of God pouring upon you. God bless you, my friends, God bless you. I will continue to be with you always and many others who have dedicated their time and efforts to support you. God bless you and keep you, beloved souls.
