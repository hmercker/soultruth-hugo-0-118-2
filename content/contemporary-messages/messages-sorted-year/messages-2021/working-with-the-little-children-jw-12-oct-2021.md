Hello Melissa! Hello Michael! Hello Ruth! Hello Jimbeau!

It’s Fred. I very much am touched by your appreciation of my life, and your acknowledgement of my journey in spirit, progressing in the Love of God, towards the Kingdom of Heaven and the Celestial realms. And yes, I do work with the children of this world; always my passion. I tell you, it would break your heart to see the condition of some of them, victims of abuse, of violence, of unlove. 

It is a vast work, and those who work with me, and there are many who have been at this for quite a long time, rejoice every time one of the little ones receives a healing, begins to trust, feel safe, and we do our utmost to provide a cloak of protection and love with all our hearts and all our souls. And when you remember that you are a child of God and that we are all His children, each one a precious gift, no matter what condition, it becomes easy to open your arms to all the children of the world, regardless of their age, there position in life, their station, their race, their religion, or their gender. For the soul is beyond those limitations. And when the Light of God’s Love touches you, fills your soul, you become as if a little child, unaware of darkness, danger, and living in the bliss and faith that the Love of God puts in your souls. How good is that! 

This Divine Love is the greatest gift, and this you know, and this knowledge you can share. But even more important, is to touch others with the gifts that this love brings into your soul, of kindness, empathy, compassion, gentleness, and great joy. I thank you all, my dear friends, and I shall come again. May all the children of the world be blessed in God’s Grace and his protection and may you each live in His Love in this life and the next, where destiny leads you to the great Kingdom of God’s Love where we are all one. Let this love change you, you won’t regret it. I love you, and I am your friend in God’s love, Fred Rogers. Won’t you be my neighbor.
