# It is Important to Remain Unified

November 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

...this world. I am Seretta Kem. It’s important that you remain unified, that you are, and have a sense that you are, a part of one another, and that in this unity there are great possibilities, a great channel of light opened in love, in your mutual efforts to be with God. The world at this time, needs light to flood in to neutralize the fear and the negativity that is so predominant in your world. So many feel isolated and alone, fearful. The condition of your world continues to worsen and the challenges continue to multiply. It is important that there is a source of light, a source of comfort and stability to come to your world so that during these times of transition and change and awakening, there is a powerful force of light and stability and love and peace that will help to calm the waters, to bring the many souls who are feeling and have a sense of this change that is coming, to be assured and have peace within their hearts so that they not be so reactive and so fearful.

You help to bring peace to the world, my beloved friends, and we are utilizing your instrumentalities and your gifts to bring great peace to the world. Not only are your angel friends involved but also, those of the Orion group are utilizing these conditions to bring upliftment and light to the world. Many are gathering together to bring this light and peace, so needed to calm the troubled waters, to bring awakening, to bring enlightenment to the many who are lost but who yearn so within their souls. Beloved, beloved souls, we thank you for your efforts and your participation, and we look forward to many more times like this together to bring many blessings to the world and many blessings to yourself.

May God bless you and keep you in His Light. I am Seretta Kem. I’m happy to be a part of this circle, this beautiful Circle of Light. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
