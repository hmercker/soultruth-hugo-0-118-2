# Every Prayer Creates an Invisible Sanctuary 

October 11<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Seattle, WA, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   

I am here, the Little Flower, Therese. I wish to say only a few things. May your prayers lead you to a fate indestructible. May the Love in your souls be so strong, it cannot be penetrated by the darkness of the world, for the Substance of Godâ€™s Love outshines and is far greater than any material possession, any riches. I know you must live in the world as you have chosen but every prayer creates an invisible sanctuary full of light and the protection of the angels.

Trust what I say because it is real. Peter and I do not wish to sound severe or to admonish anyone but to strongly encourage you to pray. Be mindful of God throughout your day the best you can. When you falter, be grateful as you get up in the dependence of God and rise. This dependence on God is always necessary. Anyone, whether they be religious, spiritual, a non-believer, scientific, intellectual, if anyone opens their heart to the Creator, they shall be blessed as you are.

Thank you. All my love and blessings from my home in the Celestial Heavens. God bless you. I am the Little Flower, Therese.
