# The Beauty of the Flower

January 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Lightbringers, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

The beauty of the flower speaks more words of truth and of God than an entire book on the subject. Consider this, my friends, it is that simple and glorious beauty, that miracle of God's creation that lifts and inspires the soul. Allow yourselves to be God's flowers, beautiful expressions of His creation. And in this those who have the vision to see, the inspiration within to draw close will come and recognize the glorious creation of God.

I am your friend Goldie and I love you, beautiful flowers all. I love you. God bless you.
