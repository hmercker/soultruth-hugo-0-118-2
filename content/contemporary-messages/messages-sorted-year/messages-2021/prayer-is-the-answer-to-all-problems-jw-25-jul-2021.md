I am here your brother and friend in God’s love, I am Judas of Kerioth. My name is often synonymous with betrayal, being a traitor, a vile sinner. For you have all heard the terms: “The Judas curse” or “Judas Priest.” But I am now an inhabitant of the Celestial heavens and I come to tell you no what your station is, no matter how separated you feel from the love of God, at any time, no matter what your sins are, all can be redeemed in the love of God as I am. 

So often one tends to focus on the error, on the pain of separation, on the loss of innocence or on some betrayal, and that pain and often the despair that comes with the remorse and sometimes even the unworthiness one feels. And yet when one does recognize and clearly sees what needs to be remedied, then one can focus on the solution. 

When something breaks in the material world, for example, you have a flat tire and you are at the side of the road and perhaps you’re running late and this is not a good feeling, and in fact can be traumatic in some instances but at some point, help comes and most especially when requested. For if you do not know how to fix a tire and you send out a request for help, someone will come to your aid. So let me put this in spiritual terms. When you feel your soul bereft of love of your connection with God and you are immersed in the consciousness of your troubles, recognizing them, at some point you send up a request, you focus on the solution with all your heart, with all your being, you call out to God, as I did. And God answers and you are sent help, and lifted up. And in this beautiful circle of souls who come for the Love of God, who come to be in His Holy Presence, who have come with the deep longings to be transformed from the mortal to the Divine, God sends us to be with you because you are on the path of Divine Love and your journey leads to the Celestial heavens where we abide in the presence of God. 

So, quite simply, I say when you recognize what seems to be the problem all one needs to do is reach out in prayer and therein lies the solution. For God’s Love is soul to soul. Call your mind to rest and your heart and soul to be forever opened in God’s Love. Be at peace in His Holy Presence. Allow joy in the eternal blessing that is yours for the asking. I shall step back and be in this prayer with you in the Glory of God. I thank you. With all my love I am with you. I am Judas of Kerioth, now an inhabitant of the Celestial heavens and your eternal friend in the love of God.
