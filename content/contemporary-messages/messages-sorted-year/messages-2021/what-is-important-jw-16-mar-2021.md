# What is Important

March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here, your brother James Padgett. When I started to receive messages from spirit, my whole quest was to hear from my dear Helen. I was filled with guilt and shame and remorse for the way I had treated her. I felt I had abandoned her, and I wanted her to know that I was sorry and that I loved her. So, when she communicated to me her great love for me, and her watching over me, I suddenly opened to feeling her presence healing my grief, and her love was a balm to my wounds and all my troubles. But I was simply shocked to hear from the Master and to be told I was chosen as the one to receive the truths of his mission, of his life, and of the laws of God and His great Love for us. 

You may be aware that I was highly doubtful, skeptical at first, and I certainly did not feel worthy of being the recipient of such messages, or in fact that they were being communicated from Jesus. What I did understand was the power and presence of the love I found myself in the midst of while the messages were being communicated to me and through me. It was undeniable and perhaps that alone allowed me to persist, to carry on, and to ultimately feel my soul being transformed by the love.

I did not know what I did not know at the beginning. I hadn’t a clue that I had these gifts and if you follow the thread from the beginning of my receptions through the years, you can see my own soul development and more and more clarity and perhaps I should say, finesse. You can also observe my own personal beliefs finding their way into messages especially at the beginning, and I would say this is true of all mediums. And those of you who are Divine Love mediums, you too will feel, and do feel, the Love of God, the great presence and light of Divine Love when receiving, which does bring clarity and allows, as time goes on, the medium to step aside more and more, and receive without prejudice or compromise, what we wish to deliver.

So, what is important is the essence of the messages, which is to pray for God’s Love, how to pray, and how to be in your soul beyond any beliefs that you now hold. Jesus presented, as well as the disciples and many others, the truths of the Gospels, of the spirit world, of life on Earth and its purpose, and ultimately the path to the Celestial Heavens. I tell you this is the most important thing to convey because it touches on the longings of each soul to go deep, to receive, and to be changed in the Love of God. Yes, I encourage you to review my life and what I delivered through brother Al,<sup>1</sup> but I wish you to remember what each soul is longing for and to convey the essence of the True Gospel. I hope I have shed some light on this one’s query and provided some clarity. Thank you. With all my love and blessings and support for the work you do. I am your brother and friend. God bless you. I am James Padgett.
