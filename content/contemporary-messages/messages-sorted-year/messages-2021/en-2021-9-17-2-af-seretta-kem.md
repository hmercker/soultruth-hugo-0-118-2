Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

We are engaged in the process of clearing many toxins, blockages, dark aspects of energies within you.  This is on all levels of your being and it is a great blessing to you to have this clearing and healing done without a great deal of effort on your part.  You are blessed to have many healers around you, many who are engaged in sophisticated ways of healing the bodies, the spirit bodies, the minds and the psychic energies around you that had been accumulated over many years of life. It has been mentioned that this clearing of conditions also reaches back through generations, and this is correct. You are not only benefiting yourself through these prayers together, but you are also benefiting those who are associated with you by blood, genetics who are your ancestors and many of these individuals are a part of the great entourage of spirits that are around you at this time. Yes many spirits are benefiting from these efforts and indeed as the light grows amongst you, so the influence grows out from you into your world and the spirit world. This light has many benefits and will benefit many in your world, and the next.  

When God blesses an effort such as this, it is not one dimensional or for one purpose, but has many purposes, many dimensions to it and many blessings associated with it. So we are utilising this time together in ways and aspects that would be difficult for you to comprehend or perceive yet some of you see more than others and share these perceptions. 

Yes, there is much happening. You often perceive those things that are close to you that are within the perview of your experience in these circles and yet there are great waves of effects and blessings, ripples, currents of light that are emanating from this beautiful circle that we have created together and God is infusing this circle with many, many blessings that are penetrating out into your world and our world. This is just the beginning and many such efforts, for it is God's will that this world be cleansed, that this world come to harmony and so you are being utilised as this instrument for this purpose.  

As many of you well know, the beginning of light and harmony starts from the energetic foundations of creation, spreading outward, influencing the material aspects of creation and so this is why prayer is so important, beloved souls, that you begin with the inner parts of you that are not material, your great soul with your desires and prayers and efforts to be an instrument and channel of God. You initiate the great spark that is awakened and transformed and expanded into something magnificent and wondrous, that touches the world and touches many souls. It is not that yourselves are powerful rather it is the power of your intention and your efforts together in sincere prayer and desire that elicits the great touch of God which is the source of all power.  In this much can be manifest and accomplished through you as material instruments upon your material plane.  

May you continue to align yourself with God. May your souls continue to absorb all of the blessings that are possible in this circle of light and that his love continues to awaken your soul, awaken your intention, awaken your desire, awaken your love for all that is, all that God has created.  

God bless you my friends, we continue to serve together and reinforce that great intention and prayer to bring healing to your world and healing to yourselves and all whom you love.  God bless you, I am Seretta Kem, my love is with you. God bless you.
