Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. It is good to see you again in this Circle of Light. I see that all of you have come to make a commitment to one another,  this purpose, and to these efforts so that you may realize success in this venture. As you come together at this time, primarily the purpose of these prayers is to bond you together, to familiarize you with one another, although many of you know each other, to get a sense that you are one body moving towards a certain goal, and that in this sense of unity, comes a great force that allows we in the spirit world to work with you on many different levels.

Indeed, we are working with each one of you and with all of you collectively in order to harmonize and to bring this unity in a powerful way so that when you come together physically into a Circle of Light within this great portal that exists in this place, so there will be a sense of harmony amongst you. Though you are certainly all individual personalities and have your unique perspectives, still the unifying power of Divine Love within your soul will ensure the unity which we are seeking.

I would encourage you to talk amongst yourselves, especially if you have particular questions and ideas to express because if you do so now, you will save much energy and time and effort when you are together in the near future. I know some of you approach these matters with a casual eye, a way of going with the flow, as you would call it, and do not concern yourself too much with the details. Others are very detail-oriented, want to know all the aspects and elements of this gathering and venture.

It is important that you engage one another and that you have a true sense of where each of you are coming from, as you would say, especially expressing certain attitudes,  fears, doubts, and reticence. These things must be eliminated from your thinking so that there is great joy and openness and harmony between you. Indeed, your sense of commitment is strong for each one comes together in the sure knowledge of why you have committed yourself in this way. I see with some of you, however, that there are great gaps of understanding. I wish for those of you who have experienced this process to be open to the questions of others and to share your knowledge and your experience regarding these gatherings together in development circle.

There is much to learn. We have shared much regarding this process. I would hope that each of you are learned in these details for we have made great effort to share these things through this instrument. They have been recorded and printed. Others have made efforts to collate the information in a way that makes it easy for each of you to come to know it and to absorb it. I would greatly recommend that you study these things, that even those of you who have been through this process before, to review these materials for in them we give a detailed outline as to what is required, the steps and processes that have been made through the months, weeks, and years of the development of the Circle of Seven as it is known by.

It is important that you spend some of your time, even within a day, to contemplate the importance of this venture, to re-affirm your commitment to it in prayer and in contemplation, so to refresh your thinking and understanding of what is required. May you come to appreciate the great effort that we in the spirit world make in order to facilitate this development circle for these efforts are great and extensive. Our commitment towards it is deep and serious. This is not a casual enterprise for it requires a great deal of energy, effort, time, and application in order for the Direct Voice to be realized in the way that we wish to have it so.

We will work with you in your sleep state, during your wakefulness, during your prayerfulness, provided you are somewhat focused upon it and your desires are put forward with your minds open. This provides a doorway for us to come close and to activate those things that we might activate during your preparation time. This is only the first step, beloved souls, only the first step, a step of many because the development of this gift requires a very precise procedure and dedication of time in order to implant within each one of you the potential of manifesting this gift.

Each of you are unique in your body, spirit body and soul. Each of you have a different chemistry. Each of you carry certain attitudes and ideas and energetic imprints from your spirit body that are unique in their patterns. So we must deal with each of these elements within you and they are many. In our efforts to harmonize these aspects of each of you with one another, I step ahead of myself in terms of what this process is for these things, primarily will be accomplished when you are together and in the flesh. But there are things that we might do now.

As you sit together in your Circles of Light, you will feel to a degree some manipulations of your body, of your brain, of your spirit body. These things we will attempt to do while  you are meeting across the wires. It is a very complex process, as I have said. I need not go into more detail, but I have expressed these things in order that you may have some idea as to what is entailed in this venture.

Consider yourself subjects of a great experiment if this helps you to be inspired to participate. For truly, this is a great experiment. Indeed, we continue to develop and learn and refine the processes that will bring success. Manipulating the chemistry of one to another is a very challenging part of what we wish to accomplish. Harmonizing your energies, the condition of your spirit bodies one with another also requires great finesse and ability among those who are working with you to do so.

The greatest challenge of all is your minds, though you are cognizant and well-versed in the ways of Divine Love, still there are many aspects and elements within your thinking and the patterns thereof which need greater effort and work in order to harmonize these energies one with another bringing true unity into your circle.

You will find that we will impress you with certain thoughts, ideas, wonderments and speculations that will help channel your thinking in certain directions. You may realize that others are thinking in the same way. Ideally, you will all see and deduce certain facts and knowledge and perspectives of the mind in a unified way so that there is no contradiction among you.

This process is not what you would call brainwashing. No, that would be amusing to think of it in this way. Rather, it is like corralling sheep in a certain direction so that they may all walk together in harmony. Each is independent yet each feels a link in unity with the others. So, within this sense of unity, as I have said, is a powerful factor in the development of this gift. The power of love is something that I have not spoken of to any great extent regarding this effort, but I say to you, that this is the very foundation of everything that we do.

May you continue to pray to receive the blessings of God’s Love within your soul for the power of this Love is a great activating agent in bringing about harmony within your being. If each individual is firmly linked with God in this way, so they are linked with one another and become an immensely powerful body and for us who reside within the Celestial Kingdom this unity and the power of Love would help us tremendously in our work. As the power of Love radiates from each one of you and towards each other, so we are able to come close, very close and thus able to do our work in a direct and powerful way.

 I urge you each day to guard your thoughts, to be dedicated in your prayers, to consider one another in loving thought and expression, to see your efforts together as a great opportunity, a wonderful blessing given to you by God. That indeed you may be able to manifest something wondrous and beautiful as a gift to the world.

Yes, we have much work to do, beloved friends, much work to do but indeed, we make a great start. There is a beautiful light amongst you. I see commitment. I feel love. I sense the great yearnings of your souls, the desire to serve with an eagerness to embark upon this great adventure with wisdom growing within you and understanding and a powerful link with God as you receive more of His Love.

Without these things, we could not step forward and make progress. So, we are delighted and joyful because you have made that first step and are willing and eager for the next steps to come. May God bless you on this journey. May we all be blessed in these efforts.

I am your servant, your friend and helper, one of many who are a part of this great venture. We will all be unified in light and love, truth and joy. May God bless us so as we continue to serve and desire, pray and express our true souls’ desires to God. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. God bless you.

**Addendum:** The medium, Al Fike, received a vision via clairvoyance after receiving the message above which was transcribed below:

I also had an experience of seeing what was going on behind the scenes in the spirit world. I saw that each one of us has a group, a posse of five spirits that are working with us and three of them are from the 5th sphere, and they were wearing a blue gown, somewhere near to this blue (pointing to his shirt), a little darker and one of them was from the 7th sphere and one of them was a Celestial. They each had a job,  one of them is for our physical health and healing, and one is somehow for light support, helping us with our thoughts. Another one is dedicated to praying for us and with us. I think that’s the one from the 7th sphere. And then, the Celestial spirit, the one who is overseeing all the four who are working with us so they become a cohesive unit for each one of us. There are different spirits for each one of us.  Some are male. Some are female. Or I guess in those planes, it doesn’t really matter since they’re androgenous anyway. The Celestial was wearing white and the one in the 7th was wearing purple, a lovely magenta purple color.

Today felt like the first DV prayer together. The one before that, last week, was, “ok, are you in?” kind of prayer and, “Are you coming back after what we’ve said to you?” and so you’re all here.

We need to take seriously what they are talking about in terms of our preparation with our minds, keeping our thoughts elevated, thinking about what we are doing, what this thing is. I don’t know whether you all have access to those books (Six Volumes of Direct Voice Messages) but read them if you can. They’re online for free. You can download them on SoulTruth.com. since they’re all there.

It’s interesting that they’re going to impress us with certain thoughts and guide us along a certain process. I wanted to share that there was St. Thomas Aquinas and Faith, the angel Faith and Thomas. They went to each one of us and looked right into us and they were making notes and they were going to share their notes and they making  a report on each one of us, (Jeanne: Oh, boy!) and they’re going to share with this other group. (Jeanne: case conferencing) So, that’s going to be the program that they’re going to be on for each one of us and it will be interesting to see what you guys come up with in your daily prayers, your thoughts and what not.

They’re very serious about this. They want to make sure that we’re prepared and ready to go. They are going to do everything on their side of life too. Each one of those five have dedicated themselves to you. It’s a very unusual scenario, because spirits often come and go with us in order to help us but these guys are going to be with us for the duration. So, it’s a big commitment on their part to be with us. It’s going to be interesting and exciting and kind of unusual. Some of you who are very psychic and have those kinds of insights will be having quite a few experiences and they will be interesting, for sure. So that’s what I have to share.
