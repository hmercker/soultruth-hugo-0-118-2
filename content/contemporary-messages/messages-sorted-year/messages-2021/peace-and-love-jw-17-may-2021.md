I am here Gandhi. I am come in peace, the great Peace of my soul, rested in God’s love. So many in the world are clinging to an *“eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth”,* seeking revenge and feeling justified in doing so. Propagated by media and film, in what are known as action movies and games full of violence, with a kind of detachment that does not allow the soul to perceive the effects of taking another life, a human life. 

When Master Jesus brought his teaching of loving your neighbors,  forgiving your enemies, turning the other cheek, this was a new paradigm. And in fact, he quoted from the law of Hammurabi that said *“an eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth”,* and he said, *“it is written that but, to love your enemies, pray for those who hate you”.* 

I came from a tradition initiated by the Jains, the Jain religion, with the concept of Ahimsa which is non-violence-peace, adopted by Hindus and Buddhists. So who around the world is able to practice this preaching? As I said, *“an eye for an eye makes the whole word blind”.* 

What I truly wish to convey to you all in this circle of peace and light and the love of God, is to spread your Peace in every way that you feel guided to do so. In my time we fasted and went on walks through my country much as the disciples of Jesus did in his time. And here you are in an age where nearly everyone has access to media and can reach out to the world, and so people do. They gather and pray for peace and when this is done even on the level what you call the *“natural love”,*  it has a loving effect. How much more powerful are your prayers in asking the Creator to bring the Essence of His Love into your souls, a love that does not fluctuate, a love that connects you to eternity, a love that is Celestial. 

So, I ask you each to please consider sending out this message of love, love Divine and the Peace that does indeed pass human understanding, each in your own way, to the world. For it would be a great blessing as in this circle there is a great blessing. Peace! Peace to all!  I am your friend in the great Love of God. I am Gandhi. Peace.
