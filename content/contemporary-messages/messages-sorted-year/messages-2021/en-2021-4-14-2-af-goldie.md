# Cultivate the Light of the Soul

April 14<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Vancouver Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

I brought a friend with me. You know him as Charlie. He wishes to convey a message to his friends whom he has cultivated and prayed with over the number of years that he joined your circles. He wants you to know that he is happy, truly happy in the Light of God's Love and that all those frustrating moments of wanting to truly feel God's Love and know God and whose heart is full with God's blessings are now a reality in his life and the truth that he knows is real and abundantly so. He is truly in the Light and he wants you to know that even when you struggle, that in your prayers and efforts together you help to cultivate the light of the soul and that he benefited greatly through your efforts and his efforts to be in God's Love, to know the joy of God's Love, to be in the light of God's Love. So he is, my friends, so he is truly and the ecstatic joy that he feels and has come to know in his experience of the spirit world has been well worth his efforts and prayers to God to bring him into the light. And so God has done so and he does truly feel the grace, the warmth, the embrace of God.

So shall you, beloved souls, each one of you will know this great blessing whether it is profound upon your earthly time or when you come into the spirit world, there will be many blessings for each of you. Know this, beloved souls, that God has many blessings waiting for you to receive and to be open and to acknowledge his wondrous Touch upon your soul.

Blessed are the peace makers, blessed are those who walk in the joy and light of God's Love. Blessed are all of you precious souls in God's Light and presence at this moment. We are together in Love and harmony, in peace and joy. And so it shall be with each Circle of Light, there will be the many blessings of God given freely to all of you. God bless you and our friend Charlie says a prayer and a thank you to all of you who have prayed for him for he has benefited from these prayers and you have benefited from his prayers. And this beautiful circle of prayerful intention will continue to sustain all of you and those who are in spirit as well, so many blessings to be given, so many prayers sent forth - one to another to another. Beloved souls, you are truly blessed and my love and joy and excitement for you upon this  journey continues to grow as I see you blossom forth and your light sparkles all about you and your souls expand in the beautiful Love of God. We are together, we are together in Love. God bless you. I am Goldie and I love you all, beautiful souls, beautiful souls. God bless you.
