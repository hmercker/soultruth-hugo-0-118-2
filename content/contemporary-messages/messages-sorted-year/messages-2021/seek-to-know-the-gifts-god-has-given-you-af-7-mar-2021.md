Greetings to you all from the world of spirit. I am Yogananda and I am very pleased that you read and spoke about these laws and opportunities to progress spiritually. Prayer is the activation of the soul. When prayer is expressed with true soul feeling and longing, then this elicits the mechanisms that God has in place for the awakening of the soul so that the blessing of Divine Love, this Essence of God, may come into the soul. So when one prays sincerely and deeply, one receives the great blessing of Divine Love. Though I was not aware at the time that I was praying when I was on Earth meditating, indeed this blessing did come into my soul and awaken my soul to the glories of my inner conscious self and the glories of God. 

Because of the biases of my mind and how I was taught and conducted myself and how I saw the world, I could not speak of these things clearly, for I did not have the language to do so even though I was an eloquent speaker and indeed, hints of this experience certainly were given in my talks and my writings. But the true understanding did not come until I entered into the world of spirit and found my way to higher spheres and in doing so, I found my way to God, which certainly was a living desire within me, and I spoke of such in the language of my day. 

So each of you, as every teacher, every yogi, every speaker of spiritual truths may say, that these things that I have experienced, these things that can be experienced, are available to each one of you, given your desire to seek this out, to practice, to make it a dedication in your life. You will find yourselves on the threshold of truth, given an open mind, a willing soul, combining the desires of both upon the great journey of life. 

I ask that you may know the blessings of God and know the gifts that God has given you and know the potentials of your own beautiful selves, both soul and mind, that indeed this is the spiritual journey. Whether you be in the world of the flesh or the world of the spirit, this is the primary motivation, this is what you seek; to know the great potentials that you carry and to express them in light, in love, in dedication, in service. This is the formula for a fulfilling life. This is the way that one may come to answer the inner yearnings. 

It is my sincere desire that you help one another on that journey and that you seek the help of those who are further along and can assist you in light. The world has many available opportunities to seek truth. It is for you to find them, through the Law of Attraction to draw them to you, and through your own efforts to expedite what blessings may come. You will all find your way because you are all seekers of truth, and so you will find your way.

I thank you for listening to me. I am now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom where the Love of God shines forth in every soul. Such magnificence and light that it is hard for me to describe the likeness of any soul therein. May God bless you my friends, and may you find the peace within and great Love from God. Blessings to you all and may Love reach your hearts fully. God bless you. I am Yogananda. God bless you.
