March 21<sup>st</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come, beloved souls. I am Jesus. I come to bring peace to those who are in need of peace. I come to assure you that the glad tidings of the Fatherâ€™s Love, this gift to your souls, is present for each one of you at this moment. I come to encourage you to open your souls and receive this gift that God has for each of you. I come for the world that is in strife to bring peace and light. Through you, this Circle of Light, a great channel of light is manifest at this moment to bring the gift of peace, to comfort the souls of those who are yearning and in pain and have a deep need for love. I come because you are all my brothers and sisters, that you are all a part of the family of God.

So, we shall walk in the light, my beloveds. So, we shall walk in the light for all eternity. We are truly brothers and sisters. We are truly in the Grace of God. Be at peace, beloveds, and know that we walk together upon this wondrous journey of life, awakening to God, coming to that great at-onement that brings unfathomable joy, that brings deep and wondrous awakening and knowings, all good, all blessings, all that is of light.

Come in this communion with your Heavenly Father. Be at peace, beloveds, and know that I walk with you. Upon every shore, every path, every byway that you travel, I am with you always and that we have a bond of love that shall never diminish but grow in strength forever. I am with you and shall never leave. So, you are never alone, beloveds, never alone. But within the Grace of God, we walk together.

God bless you, beloveds. May His Light infuse you and uplift you. May your souls open wide with the great gift that is His Essence. May you come to know your true selves, ever awakening, ever being in His company and presence. God bless you. I am with you. I bless you. My love is with you.
