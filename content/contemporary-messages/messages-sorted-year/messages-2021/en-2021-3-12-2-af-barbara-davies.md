…I am Barbara and I am a mother to this son who speaks today. I wish to say that it is important to open your hearts, my beautiful and beloved friends on the Earth plane. When your hearts are open, so your prayers to God are more intense and reach their mark more fully because of the feelings of your soul and your heart, expressed with all their vulnerability and all their power of emotion. Emotion is an important part of each individual. It is something that is often suppressed or feared or misunderstood. When one’s emotions rise up unexpectedly, there is a sense of vulnerability and a desire to control those feelings that arise. When your souls are awakened to God’s Love, you might well expect that your feelings will be heightened, that those things within you, within your soul, will emerge and come to consciousness.

When I walked the Earth, which was not that long ago, I felt a lot. Every day was a roller coaster of feeling. I sensed a lot because of my sensitivities, and my emotions were intense. My feelings of love flowed out to those I worked with, those who were in need. My feelings towards God were intense. These things, although at times felt like a burden, were a great blessing. Those emotions of the soul, those higher emotions of yourself, help to open the gates to God, help to open the flow of His Love into your soul.

Do not repress your emotions. Do not feel you must control those feelings as you pray. When you pray and you feel tearful and emotional, express this to God. For it is the gift of your soul’s expression that God cherishes and desires above all else, that you may feel and know and experience His deep Touch of Love upon your soul. So much can come in the stead of these feelings and this experience. So much may flow as you may feel in crisis or have deep reactions and emotions to the various challenges in your life, but these things are honest and truly a part of you. It is the power of that honesty and acknowledging that deeper part within you that will bring a powerful response from God. Allow your hearts to be full, my friends. Allow God to enter there-in and infill your soul with His Love as the Creator is always there ready to bless you.

May you find your way each and every day and receive that blessing of Love that opens the door to all of these parts of your soul that are yearning to be expressed, to be free of the tyranny of the mind and to have free reign in your experience of life. For with this depth comes great wisdom, perception and sensitivity. Those things you long for as you reach for God, as you desire to know your angel friends. The opening of your feelings is the key to that door that will allow you such insight and knowing.

Know that you are loved deeply, and may you love deeply. May you come to know the deep feelings within your hearts and your souls, for this is a manifestation of your true self. In God’s gifts to you, so these things will emerge and grow and flower in your experience in life. Accept this, know this to be part of God's gifts, part of God's Creation within you, and you will find a liberation, an exaltation, a beauty and a joy that will come with the awakening of your heart with God's great blessings of Love.

My love is with you my friends and I am happy to pray with you today. Thank you for listening to me. May God bless and keep you in His Light. God bless you.
