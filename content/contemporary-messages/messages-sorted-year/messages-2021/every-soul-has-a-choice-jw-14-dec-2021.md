My dear brothers and sisters,
 
The gift of free will is a gift of choice. It allows every soul to decide which path to take. It allows for each soul to discern its destination on earth, and more importantly, beyond in spirit. What is given is a reminder to be aware that you may be awakened in God’s Love, the somnambulant world is being tested by everything that is happening on earth at present. For most the response is fear; and fear is a resistance to the openness of Love. It is a closed heart. The Love of God changes every soul, opens every heart to the sacredness of life, to the preciousness of every soul. One begins to get a sense of the eternal. It requires persistence, it requires you to be in touch with the longings, the deep longings in your souls, that send you into prayer. And our Heavenly Father’s response which is to touch you, to fill you, to change you. When you are in God’s Grace you feel empathy for all of humanity, even those who may hate you. This is what is required. That you may show the world the love in your soul which is the Love of God. That those in darkness may see the light. I give you my blessing and know that it is humble. The magnificence of God humbles every soul, and in that there is great glory and treasure. So, trust and have faith. 
           
I love you with all the love in my soul, and I shall be your friend through all eternity where we are all one in God’s Love, I am Jesus. God Bless You.
