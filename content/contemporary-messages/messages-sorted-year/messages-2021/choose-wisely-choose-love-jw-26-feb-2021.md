My dear ones, I am here, Care. Music is a form of prayer, when it comes from the longings of the soul. Movies that lift you up, that inspire you, that touch your heart, that have a moral compass or spiritual aspiration, can change one. What you read, what you take in is worthy of serious consideration. Follow your heart to joy. Follow your soul to bliss. One does not have to live the blues, as they say, to have them. But as this one knows, singing the blues allows one to be lifted from that condition, and that, should be the goal of a song, of a dance, of a movie, of a book, of a poem, of a prayer. They are all mediums, or you might say, possible channels of light and love. So choose wisely, choose love, choose joy. May God bless each one of you this day and always with His great love. I am with you and I love you. I am Care.
