# Jesus Will Meet Us at the Gates of Heaven

February 17<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Vancouver Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, the gates of heaven remain open. I am Jesus and I come to assure you that I will meet you there at those gates someday. That I will greet you and embrace you and welcome you to the Kingdom of Heaven. That all your prayers and efforts, all your thoughts and longings, all that is within you that longs to be with God, will bring you to this threshold and carry you through as your souls are transformed in love, the mighty Essence of God, conveyed by the Holy Spirit that touches your soul daily in your prayers, drop by drop, uplifting, healing, changing you, transforming you as God beckons you to be one of his angels in the Celestial Kingdom.

In God’s beseeching of your soul to awaken, to open, to be transformed, you are walking forward in light and walking upwards into conditions of rarified spirituality, of love, of joy, of great light. These things come to you because you have accepted the truth and applied it in your relationship with your Creator and your relationship with your life. And so it will be, the great reward that comes from the penitent soul, those who are willing to forego all that is of the human condition, all that is of the mindful inclinations and desires and accept the great awakening, knowing and wisdom of the soul that comes with love.

You will find your way, no matter what condition you are in, whatever predicament that comes your way, God will guide you through. Your souls will be strengthened by every challenge, your minds will be enlightened by your soul’s knowings. You will come to truth, in joyful abandon, in loving acknowledgement, in deep faith and knowing that God has His hand upon you. You are His children truly, and I am your brother, truly. Together we will walk the Halls of Heaven and speak our praises to God and the wonderment of His Creation.

So, we know one another, not from that place of mind but that place of deep soul perception and will come to acknowledge all that is in harmony with God, with His Love and with His Creation. What joy that will bring to each of you. What astounding revelations that will come. What wondrous journeys you will make on your way to the doorways to Heaven. You will be guided, protected, and empowered with love. You will know the true depth and power of God’s love, awakening and healing, uplifting and informing your soul so that you may be fit to enter through these gates and truly become my brother and my sister upon this great journey, upon the road to at-onement with God.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your friend and brother. I am master of the Celestial Kingdom and I walk with you. I walk with you all upon this great journey of light. God bless you. My love is with you, beloveds. My love is with you all. May you come to know my love for you. For it reflects but a small portion of the Love of God and that Love that He has for each one of you and so the light of this Love shall shine upon you, uplift you, bless you and warm you so that you may feel the joy of a soul in alignment with God, with great joy, with great love. God bless you, beloveds.
