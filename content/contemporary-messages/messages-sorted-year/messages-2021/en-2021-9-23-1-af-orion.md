# All Souls in the Universe are Created with Free-will Choice to Follow the Natural or Divine Path

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Orion received by Al Fike

...souls, I am Orion. I wish for you to know that God has seeded many places in the universe with souls waiting for their journey back to God. As He casts these seeds about, these sparks of light that come from His Soul and creative impulses, when these seeds reach fertile ground, they come alive and so begins the journey of the soul. From the Great Womb of God life begins. Through the vehicles of a body and a spirit, God ensures that every soul is provided for so that soul may live upon a material life and a spiritual life. And as that seed germinates, so uniqueness, a freshness of that individual creation of God is realized, all its potentials still awaiting further growth, further awakendness.

The truth that you know, beloved souls, of the two paths of realization, is a powerful truth, a truth that every soul must come to know so that they may make that choice to further grow and develop as the individualized soul that it is, or to be transformed and awakened into something new and beautiful. This choice exists in the universe, it is a journey replicated in many different places. Indeed, the choice is given to every soul and this is reflected in many different places in the universe. Some worlds are focused upon the development of the mind and the purification of the soul into greater light and greater life and enlightenment, and some worlds are focused upon the great journey towards God and the awakening that God gives to every soul who desires it. I am from one of those worlds, the world where love reigns supreme. It is our desire, as it is for every world that is in alignment with this truth, that all other worlds may come to it and find and realize the great glory of this journey towards at-onement with God.

So, it is our privilege to be with you, to share with you this journey, to encourage you upon it and to assist you in bringing this truth to your brothers and sisters. There is no other way that this truth may come but through the examples and bright lights of those who have made this journey and understand what it truly is. So, we encourage you, our beloved friends, to continue upon this journey with great enthusiasm and dedication, with your prayers and your efforts to walk in the light and the truth of God’s Love, this great Elixer of the soul that awaits every soul that has ever been created. It is God’s desire that every soul may come to this and to truly understand it and live by its truth. But as with all that God has created there is a choice, and each soul must come to that place where the choice is made and the journey veers in one direction or another.

It is not that God loves those beautiful souls who continue upon what you call the natural path any less than He loves those children who seek at-onement with Him, but those children who seek at-onement will know the glories of His Love with such depth, with such profound knowing and feeling, that to compare the two journeys is not possible. For, the power of love, the blessings of love, the greatness of love is the highest of all blessings, all substances in the universe, all that God has created. This great gift has such a power, such an effect upon the soul that in time, it is transformed forever, and the potentials, the full potentials of the soul are realized and expressed upon an eternal journey of awakening and being within the flow of God’s Love.

Our desire is that you teach this truth my friends, for would it not be wonderful to have another world in God’s universe that is truly in alignment with the Truth of His Love. What a bright place this will be, a place filled with love and harmony and grace, a place where the soul is eager to incarnate and be fulfilled in this journey. So much can come with love that it would be impossible for us to list the benefits that we have received through accepting this journey unilaterally where we live. Yet, here we are together and here we journey together in a great light, with great collaboration and love. What a gift God has given us to be able to be together in prayer, to work together so that this truth may come forth in the world, unimpeded. Our prayer is that many doors will be open to you and much grace will befall you, that you may journey in a life that is enriched by love, the beautiful Love of God, the love that is within you transformed and that that love is expressed with great light, exuberance, wonderment, beauty.

May your world be filled with light. May all who dwell upon it find the key that will allow them to walk in light, express light, and be one who emanates light, love, wisdom and truth, all the goodness of God that may reverberate in your world. You are so blessed my friends. When we see you around us in this world of yours, we have great appreciation of your strength and your dedications, of your choice and what has brought you to that choice. For you have truly chosen the highest path, the greatest journey, the most fulfilling that can come to any soul. You are truly blessed and we are blessed to know you.

God bless you, my friends. I am Orion and I am privileged to be with you in this Circle of Light. My love is with you. God bless you.
