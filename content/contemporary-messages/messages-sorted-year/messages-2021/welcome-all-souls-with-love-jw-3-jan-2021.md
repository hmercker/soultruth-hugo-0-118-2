# Welcome all Souls with Love

January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2021

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh



I am here your brother in Christ. I come in the grace of God. As Paul wrote: *“Though I speak with the tongues of angels but have not love, I am as if a clanging bell,”* how important it is to lift others up, lift them up in love, to encourage them, to speak truth, and to shine a light in the darkness. Those who have been on the path of God’s love for many years, those who communicate with us, are always aware that love is the currency of the Kingdom. 

Have compassion for those who have not discovered the great truth of prayer and the reality of the transformational power of God’s love. Those who seek the answers through the mind, love them, for did we not all at one time seek answers through the intellect, wanting to have knowledge leading to understanding only to discover what we were seeking was the love of God? This love brings compassion, empathy, and a desire to serve all regardless of their status, of their race, of their religion, of their ethnicity, of their gender and so forth. 

Every soul you encounter brings the opportunity to radiate the love of God and bless them. For though you cannot put the love of God in their soul, as only God can do this, you can touch them and embrace them in the love of God that is in your soul. I remind you of this because I love you. 

I ask you to go into the world with this consciousness, with this love, with this blessing, without discrimination without judgement for all are equal in the eyes of God; all are His children, and He awaits each one to come to Him, with open arms. So welcome all. 

May you be blessed this day and always, the beautiful souls that you are with the gifts you have received, beyond doubt. With all my love and blessings, I am your brother in the love of God. I am Yogananda.
