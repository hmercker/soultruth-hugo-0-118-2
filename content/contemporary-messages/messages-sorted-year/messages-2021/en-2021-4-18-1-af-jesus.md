Jesus received by Al Fike

Precious and beloved souls, I come, I am Jesus. I come to gather you in a blessing from God that we may all be gathered in this Circle of Light to receive the benediction of God's great Soul to your soul given through the Holy Spirit, His manifestation and messenger of Love.

Do you not feel this grace upon you, beloved souls, this powerful Touch from God? Know that this is yours always. Given your prayer and desire to receive it, so you shall have it as a gift given to your soul. May your prayers be intense, beloveds. May you come to truly know God, to realize that you were made in God's image and that now God is fulfilling His promise to you to bring His substance within you so the image becomes substance so that you may be fulfilled in God's Will and desire that each and every soul that has been created may come to reflect truly and deeply those things of God which are meant to be within the soul.

In this way you will be transformed. In this way you will become a new being experiencing the new birth and expressing this great gift as it truly is and will be within you, this unique reflection of God in the world.

As I have traveled in this truth and light, so too you will travel and be in this truth and light. You are all destined to enter the Celestial Heavens when that time comes and you are completely transformed by the great Love of God. I shall be there to greet you, beloved souls, I shall be there to greet you and show you your heavenly place, your residence in the Celestial kingdom.

All is a journey towards at-onement with God and we journey together, do we not? Precious and beloved souls, we journey together upon that path that fulfills God's plan and destiny for each of you. So we are brothers and sisters, so we are lights in the firmament of God's creation, so we are the beautiful fulfillment of God's wondrous universe. We are His lights and we shall shine brighter for all eternity, never dimming but forever increasing in our light as we continue to receive His great blessing of Love. So we are lights within the firmament.

May God continue to bless you, beloved souls, carrying you ever upward, uplifting and healing, and transforming so that you are truly what you are meant to be, beloved children of God expressing all of the gifts, the beauty and the glory that one's soul can possess.

God bless you. I am your brother. I am your friend. I walk with you always. Beloveds, you are never alone, you are never alone for God is with you and His angels by your side. So you travel like many who are indeed in alignment with God. Those who wish to be in alignment shall indeed receive these blessings and know this comfort, this companionship of Love. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you and keep you in His Light, Love surrounding you. Drink deep this Essence, drink as much as you can for this very moment God pours His Love like a great cascading waterfall upon each one of you. Drink deep, receive this Essence and so we will fulfill God's promise to humanity. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with you, my love is with you. God bless you.
