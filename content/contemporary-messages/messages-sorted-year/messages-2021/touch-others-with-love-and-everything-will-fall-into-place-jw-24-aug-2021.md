# Touch others with Love and everything will fall into Place

August 24<sup>th</sup>, 2021 

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am your brother in Christ, Paul, the Evangelist. I am sometimes credited with the spreading of the message of Jesus beyond the Jewish community to the Gentile world, and to a certain extent that is true. 

As is the case as with those who are credited with writing the Gospels, Epistles, and letters, much of what has been attributed to me I did not write. But I did write: *“Though I speak with the tongues of angels if I have not love, I am but a clanging bell”.* So, in the context of your desire to spread the Gospel of God’s Love and the truths that you now have knowledge of, remember that words without love behind them will often fall upon deaf ears, or simply sound as a clanging bell. 

I did have the Love of God in my soul and though some of what I understood was in error and not perfectly aligned with the masters teaching, the love that I possessed caused people to listen to my words. And yes, we had miracles and there were signs which were all a result of my prayer, my communion with God, and my faith. 

So I remind you to bring this love to those you wish to share it with and proclaim that they can receive it by going to God as you have. Touch them with this love first and foremost and everything will fall into place as you so desire. Because I am aware of your time today<sup>1</sup> on earth I shall leave you with that. Be in God’s Love. Pray. Share. With all my love I am your brother and friend and a redeemed so who is an inhabitant of God’s celestial heavens. I am Paul. May God bless you.
