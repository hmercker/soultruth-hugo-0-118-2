# Discerning Guidance

March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, it is your teacher Augustine. How lovely to see you together in prayer my beautiful and beloved friends, sincere in your endeavors, your desire to serve your brothers and sisters, and to serve the Will of God.

The mind will always second-guess the soul beloveds, and this will be the case until that wondrous integration of both takes place. The soul is strong enough and filled with the Fathers Love to the degree that it can indeed make possible this integration of thought and consciousness. So many things percolate up from your soul: guidance from God, perceptions from your faculties and desires that come in your relationship with God. It is your challenge, as it is for all who wish to know their own soul in a conscious way, to not allow the filters of the mind to heavily influence the information that is given from the soul. The condition of filtering and biasing and making more complicated things that come in this way, need your discipline and your discernment and wisdom so that you may see the kernel of the truth or guidance that is given. Allow this kernel to grow and gestate so that what is meant to be may flower and become a living reality within yourself, within your conscious being.

Receiving guidance is both an art and a science. It is subject to so many variables and inner conditions within the individual. Few are able to see clearly and unbiasedly those gifts of inspiration and guidance which come to your soul from God. But we are here to help you, beloved souls, to help clarify what it is that you are perceiving and to help you see the intention and the power of this guidance that may come. So you are well on your way to being guided in this way, and much that comes is meant to be integrated into the great plan of God for your own salvation and for the world’s salvation.

These gifts will continue to open and gain power and clarity as you continue to grow in God's Love. In a way, it is necessary to discount the mind’s initial reactions to guidance, and with patience and faith to rest upon my guidance until that second wave of insight comes, and at times a third wave, as things become more clear within your conscious self. To know the Will of God is often an elusive and subtle thing, although there are times when it is powerful and unmistakable. But truly your challenge is in integrating that which God gives, to make sense of it and to put it forth into action in ways that confirm that inner knowing that all is right and in harmony with this guidance.

The problem remains with those who are very willful and wish to move ahead beyond the scope and timing of God's Will. Those individuals who are steadfast in their belief that they are receiving the guidance from God, often stumble and fall and cause for themselves great problems and confusion. But I see with you beloved souls, a humility and a sort of tentative approach, which is preferable to that of the willful desire for one’s ambitions to unfold in a mindful way. In time, that balanced place of knowing, of feeling, of discerning, of thought, will come to be where the Love of God will bring great insight and great peace. This comes gradually for each one of you, and I'm happy to see that you are open and receptive to these experiences of the soul and bring these insights forward for consideration, so to be aware of the wisdom of the soul and the impetuous nature of the mind.

We in spirit rarely answer definitive questions regarding guidance, for it is more important for you to discern for yourself and gain insight and strength in regard to this experience, an outpouring of God’s Will in your life. We will not allow you to stumble too much, but at times you may find yourself heading down a wrong path in terms of discerning your guidance, but God will always bring you back to that center point, to that core of truth, and you will find your way. It is the nature of life upon this world of yours as to how the human condition continues to impinge upon the experiences of the soul and the expression of the soul. Yet you continue to persist, to be dedicated to the Truth of God's Love, and so with strength and dedication you will find your way.
 
What God has in store for you, His plan for your life, will invariably unfold in all its beauty and joyous expression. So you will find your way. You will know your way, and you will know from all aspects of your being the road to take, the decisions to make, and how your gifts may unfold to bless your brothers and sisters as a channel of God's Will and Love and desire to bless His children.
 
God bless you beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. I am happy to speak to you today so that you may consider the differences between the experiences of the soul and that which the mind interprets and experiences in its own right. May God bless you with His Love. My love is with you always. I am your teacher Augustine. God bless you.
