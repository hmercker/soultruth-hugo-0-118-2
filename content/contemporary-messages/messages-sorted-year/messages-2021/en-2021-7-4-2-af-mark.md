# Blessings for the First Spiritualist Church

July 4<sup>th</sup>, 2021

First United Spiritualist Church, Burnaby, BC, Canada

Mark received by Al Fike

Dearly beloved souls, may His Love touch your soul and bring you to the awareness of His presence, for God wishes to communicate with every one of His children. I am Mark and I oversee this beautiful family, this Circle of Light, this church of love. And I say to you, my beloved friends, continue to seek light in your lives, continue to seek truth within your hearts and your minds, continue to be an instrument of light in the world, for these are the things that are needed at this time. The requirement of God for His children is that they may love one another and seek to be a light for one another in this world so that this world may be healed and uplifted in light, so that this world may once again be in harmony and in the truth of God's Creation.

It is easy to release this responsibility, to ignore the responsibility that each individual upon this world of yours carries, and that is to live a life that is in harmony with all that is of life and all that is of God. It does not require the adhesion to books and ideologies, merely for the heart of the individual to be in alignment with all that is and will be of light. Each of you, beloved souls, has the capacity to know this and to live this and I urge you to do so, my friends, to be in the light, to be truly in harmony with all that is of light. In this way, you contribute to the healing of your world and to the healing of your own true self.

Come to know your Creator, for your Creator has a deep longing to know you in a way that you acknowledge and recognize this relationship of love, for you are deeply and truly loved by God. Allow God's Love to flow into you, to truly be a part of you, and in this way you may walk in the world as a light, you will be compelled and do so with joy, to bring love wherever you reside. Whatever situation you may encounter in the world, you will be a channel of love.

When you are in alignment with love and in alignment with God's great Soul which is Love, these things, these powerful elements of life and elements of God's great Soul will be expressed through you and around you, bringing great joy and great peace. With truth, you will bring a strength and faith that will carry you through all circumstances and situations that you may encounter within the world.

May God bless each and every one of you. May you be truly His children. May you come to know the joy of your own soul awakened by love. God bless you. I am Mark. I am happy to be with you today in the service of love and light. God bless you.
