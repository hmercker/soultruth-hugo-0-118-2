I am here Judas.

Happy New Year my dear friends Rosh Hashanah!  This is a good time to begin anew, to change course, to walk in faith.
 
The will of God allows for everything in the big picture to be in harmony. And despite all of the in-harmonies created by free will there is no force that can disrupt the harmonious structure and being of the universe created in love and in  light by God. What shall be your New Year’s resolution? What do you wish for your own soul? For as you have discussed a soul that is transformed, a soul living in Grace, draws all good and perfect things to itself. This magnetism is the great attraction, for all beings, desire love.
   
This is the Jewish New Year and this month where Yom Kippur<sup>1</sup>, the day of atonement and At-Onement fall, when the Jewish community seeks forgives for their sins, for their misdeeds, for their in-harmonies, by asking for mercy and to be newly anointed. I point this out so that you will make a connection for yourselves, not in a religious sense, but in your spiritual lives. To start fresh each day, to carry the intention to be changed, transformed, and made anew in God’s love. And yes, you will expiate whatever holds you back, whatever separates you from the Creator, when you allow His love in. The more love that comes into your soul, the more whatever has separated you shall disparate, like a weight around your heart that has held you down as now you are lifted up in love and light. 
   
May the gate of light be opened may the gate of God’s love be opened. May every blessing be yours and may you have faith and know we have your back in all things.  You have given great joy to Mr. R.J Lees, to Rev Owen, to sister Eileen Caddy,  and all of us here as you continue to explore and absorb the truths that have been given. Take them all in as best you can, and I promise you will not be disappointed. 

With all my love and blessings, I am your brother and eternal friend in the love of God. A redeemed soul, I am Judas. God Bless you!
