# Pray for Your Loved Ones

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

Blessings for you friends of the earth, children of God. I am Mylora and I come to bring a blessing of healing and upliftment for you all, to pray with you for the great gift of God's Love, to be with you in this grace of His Love and blessings upon each one of you. Beloved and beautiful friends, may you continue to journey on the path of light and truth, to be God's instruments of love, healing, peace and comfort for your brothers and sisters.

We continue to be uplifted in God's beautiful Touch. We continue to be God's children in His universe of love. Beloveds, how blessed we are to have this fellowship, how blessed are we to be in communion together in God's great gift of Love. How powerful is this gift to unite us in His Truth, in His Love so that all are blessed, all continue upon the journey of awakening the soul, being in greater unison and harmony with God and all His laws and blessings that come to His children who seek, who open themselves to these great blessings.

Beloved souls, drink deep these waters and know that we are here to uplift you. Each one of you have an angel by your side. Feel the communing together as you reach for God and know that God provides all that you require to be with Him always and forevermore.

Precious, beloved souls, we are together, we are of one family. We walk on a singular path that leads to at-onement with God. Drink deep the waters that carry us, awaken us, enliven us within our souls so that we may truly be that light that God wishes for us to be, that beautiful and blessed light that is meant for all, that is available to all.

Pray for your loved ones, your families, all whom you know, all who are part of your life. Pray that God will implant within them the desire for His Love. When that time comes when they recognize what God has gifted them in this blessing of desire, you will be there to inform, to uphold, and to direct them upon this path. As we do for you, so you may do for them and we will do for one another on God's glorious path of Love.

It is the power of Love that connects us all. It is the power of Love that heals the soul. It is the power of Love that awakens the soul, provided we desire it and long for it and pray for it.

Shall we pray, beloved souls? Together in prayer we draw the mighty inflowing of His Love into our souls.

May God bless you, uplift you, heal you, and awaken you. Beloveds, beloveds, your friend Mylora is with you today in prayer. God bless you, beloveds.
