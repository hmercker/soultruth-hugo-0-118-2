# Blessing 2

March 28<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I have given each of you a blessing to lighten your burdens in this world and to increase your perception of your soul that you may come to God more clearly and fully. Allow this gift to sink deep within you as a glowing ember of warmth that will help to awaken you and bring you the strength that you need to continue on in your journey of awakening your soul, receiving the great gift of God’s Love.

Each of you are of great interest to me and we have a strong and abiding bond of love together for we are brother and sister in the world and we shall indeed do God’s work together. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I walk with you always. Know that in times of need and comfort that I will be there. And together we will turn our eyes to God and seek His Love and healing and grace, together we bring light to the world, together we become a force for change that will bring greater harmony to the world, together we will know the joy, the wonderment and the beauty of God’s great Love for us. May we continue on this journey together, truly we are bonded in love. God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you in His Light. God bless you.
