It is Seretta Kem. You are living on the edge of what you might call normalcy in this world. The very beginnings of serious break-downs of your social and economic systems is very close. So, you are feeling the stress of this change, as is everyone in the world, a sense that all is not working as planned. 

There are many who are fighting to restore what you would call normalcy in the world but unfortunately they will not succeed. Their time is done. The time of your way of life is finishing. So, you rush about to gain as much advantage as you can before the onslaught. This is understandable. Indeed, you will not lose your home and the comforts that you have, certainly not any time soon. But there will come a time when all of these ways and means of life will need serious adjustments and recalibration in order to fit into God’s plan to bring harmony back to the world, all creatures of the world, all that lives in the world. Of course, you are all creatures of the world and must find a way to co-habit with all that is in this beautiful creation of God.

We continue to urge you to grow within your souls, to receive the great blessing of God’s Love so that you will know and find the wisdom within yourself and act accordingly as change is required and adjustments are necessary. You will find a way through with God’s guidance, protection, and love for you. You will demonstrate for yourself the power of prayer, the power of God’s guidance in times to come.

In this you will teach others, for the experiences which you will have will be invaluable, as will the knowledge that you gain through dealing with the various crises and pressures that are coming with a changing world. How fortunate you are to live in such a beautiful place that is not altogether undergoing the stressors of a changing world although they are certainly evident and in some cases close by. 

But God has guided you well, has He not ? Bringing you to a place of safety and beauty, where there is greater harmony than many other places in the world. It is time for you to look around, beloved souls, and see how blessed you are, to appreciate the beauty, the wonderment, the grace, and the peace that is here and how God has provided for you in so many ways.

Nothing is ever perfect and this world will never be perfect. Your needs will never be perfectly met but you will have what you need when you need it in these coming times. You will not starve. You will not perish. You will not dwindle away from events and conditions that are changing your world. Rather, given the desire to be in greater harmony with God, so you will be strengthened. So, you will rely upon the healing and blessings of God to guide, uplift and  protect you. 

Do not extrapolate your worries of the coming times upon the immediate future for this is not necessary. Allow yourselves the joy and pleasure of communing with your friends, of being together in these sacred places, this Portal of Light. Have faith that you are protected, beloved souls. I am not suggesting that you abandon all wisdom and what you call common sense, but I assure you that you are all protected and uplifted in God’s great plan with His Hand upon you. Trust in God’s Will. Trust in God’s plan. Trust in God’s guidance. Trust in the power of His Love to heal and transform. You will truly be blessed, beloved souls.

It is important that you be at peace and allow yourselves the luxury of peace, to be the harmony with all that is around you, allowing yourselves to be God’s instruments each and every day for all who are drawing to you. Those coming to be comforted and blessed so you may be an instrument of God, a channel of His Love in the world. Allow this to be with every breath. Do not allow your minds to overcome, take hold, and envelop that light of your soul with fears and anxieties and imaginings that are not in harmony and love. 

May you be blessed greatly within your souls, beloveds. Allow yourself to be in this Grace that is God’s Presence. Open yourself to the inflowing of His Love and know the peace that passes all understanding. It is here for you at this moment, here for you at every moment. So we are together in prayer. May God bless us deeply within our souls, uplift us so that our minds are at peace, our souls are in the rapture of joy as we commune with God.
God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. I am with you often, beloved souls, with you often. My love is with you. God bless you. God bless you in His Love.
