Jesus received by Al Fike

God bless you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to make comment on your conversations together. Beautiful souls that you are, bright in the Father’s Love, so your dedications to one another are important and I would urge you to continue in your conversations and your efforts together.

You made mention of that time not that many years ago when you came together and I spoke and many other Celestials spoke to you about the need for your common efforts to be strong and supportive of one another. Indeed, many seeds were planted at that time and your coming together was not a waste of time or a failure but merely another step towards God’s plan to bring salvation to all. Do not doubt yourselves, beloved souls. I urge you to make the efforts required to maintain this bond of Light, to be together and to feel the power of that bond supporting and uplifting one another for each of you have your gifts to share. Each of you is a channel of Light and Love and when you direct your gaze upon one another then that benefit comes forth as God uses you as His channels. Do not feel reluctant, beloved brothers and sisters, but know the joy within your souls that says *‘I am a part of a beautiful family, a Light filled family, a family who shares a great truth, the truth of God’s Love.’*

In this acknowledgement, in your prayers and in your thoughts may you continue to strengthen this bond and consider one another in a way that you are family, and as all families do, they come together in love and seek one another out with the acknowledgement that they belong, that they are a part of. And this is important, beloved souls, even though you may be far away in miles, may your hearts be close and may you feel the love that is surely there within your souls for one another and utilize the power of this bond to bring about the fulfillment of God’s great plan.
It is for you to seek, to pray and to know this plan and your place within it. But know that as you acknowledge your place you will come to see the place that is designated for each one, the power of this designation that God has given to each soul who has a purpose and desire to work for the fulfillment of the upliftment and healing of humanity. So you see a great strength, a great joy, a great willingness amongst yourselves to walk together and to truly be brothers and sisters. A great power comes in this acknowledgement and bond. It is necessary so that God’s plan may flow through each of you and towards each other, making this beautiful Lattice of Light that will be a powerful force in the world for change and healing and peace.

You have yet to truly discover the potentials within your souls. In this bonding will come a gift, a blessing through each individual soul towards the other to help them come to realize the great potentials within them. As God infuses each soul with His Love, so that Love pours forth and is powerful in these bonds and in this blessing and dedication that you have towards one another, so a strengthening, an opening, and a blessing may be given one to another as God’s instruments of Light. My great desire is that the children of the world will come together in Love.

Indeed, all of these mechanisms and ways that you may communicate now are a part of God’s plan to unite humanity. These gifts have made it possible so that you may be close to one another at least to communicate and to share. This combined with the powers of your souls’ desires to be bonded and together in this great venture that you call Light Bringers, I tell you that the power of this will grow and that the numbers within your community will grow and in this awakening of truth so the world will come to know the great choice that God has given each soul, that they may choose to walk the path Divine towards at-onement with God—or not. To share this truth, to indicate to your brothers and sister that there is a choice and a great possibility for the redemption of their souls in Love, you will have fulfilled your task and you will have come together for the great purpose that God has intended which is to share with humanity this great truth and the possibilities that come with acknowledging this truth within the hearts and souls of each individual.

Be the examples of truth, beloved souls, share with one another your heartfelt desires and intentions, be open as brothers and sisters are together, trust one another, trust in the feelings and knowings of your souls so that you may step forward with confidence and with true understanding of your next steps. For God will guide each one of you individually and guide this body of intentions and desires to serve humanity. Forward, ever forward, and all will come together and coalesce in a powerful group of dedicated souls expressing the truth of God’s Love, being bright examples, beautiful instruments of God’s Will and desire and blessings for many. All this requires is some effort on your part, some acknowledgement and focus to come together in loving intention, to have faith that God is guiding, that you will together discover deeper and greater truths and intentions which God has for each one of you and that in this coming together will be a great flowering of understanding, of efforts, of ventures that are in harmony with God’s Will and plan.

You are His children and God will indeed rest His hand upon you and bring to you all the blessings, all that is required for you to accomplish your missions, your purpose and the awakening of your own soul in greater measure of Love. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother, I walk with you, my love is with you, my prayers are with you and I love you. God bless you, I am Jesus.
