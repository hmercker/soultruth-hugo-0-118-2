I am here your sister in God’s Love, your friend. I am Care. I often come to this prayer circle to be with my beloved but also because I am drawn to this group of souls who are not so much in their minds but drawn here with the longing in their souls. This I could relate to on earth. 

I know that some of you are surrounded by those who cannot fathom the idea of a soul being transformed in the Love of God, the simplicity of prayer without all the baggage of dogma, and yet my dear friends that light that shines from your souls, this makes an indelible impression upon all those family and friends and even those you may not know.

The early Christians, so many martyrs who died not willing to give up their beliefs in the Love of God, in their teacher, who had this glow within their souls more powerful than death. One can wonder about them as to how were they not completely wiped out, which was one of the goals of those who persecuted them? And this is because that love that they carried impressed those who may have come for entertainment but left with an awakened conscience. As you may know, Roman Emperors Caligula and Nero, who murdered their soulmates, are now inhabitants of the Celestial heavens. And even (Julius) Caesar got blessed! 

On my journey I often wondered, with all this time in prayer, feeling the Love of God, talking with the Celestial angels, seeing the future even, have I done any good? And yet, this one who sits before you, almost 30 years after my passing into spirit, has never forgotten, because the Love of God made an indelible impression upon his soul. And so with each of you it is. 

The glory of this love, the circle of light, the Presence of God and His angels, this you receive. This you take with you into the world. From my experience I would suggest you not spend any time being concerned about the outcome of what you seek to bring to others, which is the Love of God. And believe me, it is in God’s hands. All you need to do, should you wish to do so, is plant the seeds. Be the love, be the Light, as song says, this is God’s delight. And it is mine to be here with you. I shall step back in the beautiful silence of this glorious prayer. Thank you. May God bless each one of you. I am Care.
