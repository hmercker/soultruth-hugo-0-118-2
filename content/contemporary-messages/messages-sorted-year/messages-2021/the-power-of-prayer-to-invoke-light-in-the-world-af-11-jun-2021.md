Bless you beloved souls, I am your teacher, Augustine. We are all with God at this moment. For each of you have come into this circle of light with earnest longings of the soul seeking to be with God. And so God responds with His love pouring down upon you, unifying each together in this great circle of light. I urge you, beloved souls, to open your souls wide and beseech God with all earnestness and desire. To not present yourself to God in half measure, but fully present in God’s great blessings and light and presence. For you are each precious to God. You are each His child and you are indeed, loved. As you pull to you this great light, as you seek within that feeling heart of yours that desire to be with God, so intense and powerful, so the laws, interaction, and response bring a light around yourself and many blessings forward into your being and presence wherever you may be in the world. Those you have prayed for are also blessed. Those you love are also blessed and the many who are connected to this group are blessed. For in the power of this light generated in the presence of God, which you have invoked with the great blessing of love that you have asked for, so there is a powerful response. So the laws are obeyed and the response is clear and unequivocal in its touch upon you all. 

Beloved souls, seek the power and blessing of God’s Love upon you with all your hearts, all your souls, all your minds. Seek this, beloved souls. Seek this above all else. The rest is but conjecture, interpretation and chimeras of the mind that are brought with words and explanations. Without this central desire, without asking with all your heart, without desiring with all your soul, these words mean nothing. For it is in the deeper parts of yourself, those aspects that are often hidden or unknown but still are alive and functioning within your being that the truth is understood, the response is given, the love flows and in time all comes to the understanding of the soul. You are children of God, beloveds, children of God. Come to God with innocence, with deep desire, with soulful prayer and you will receive the answers, the experiences, the blessings fully within you and around you shining forth in your life and as such, being a channel for God in light and love. It is this simple prayer, the simple way that ignites all other responses, all truth, all awakening, all that is within your grasp and desire to receive and know and experience.

May God bless you beloved souls. We come here together, you on the material plane and we in the Celestial Heavens to pray together, to be in the light and bask in the light of the Father’s Love together, the Almighty touching our souls in ever greater abundance and power, transformative qualities and expressions of His Soul conveyed to our souls through the Holy Spirit and all things that come in God’s blessings for us. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine and I come to pray with you, to encourage you in prayer, to help bring a condition that may inspire you and uplift you in prayer. God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you. My love is with you all. God bless you.
