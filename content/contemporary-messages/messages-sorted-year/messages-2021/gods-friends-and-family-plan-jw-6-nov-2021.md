# God’s Friends and Family Plan
November 6<sup>th</sup>, 2021 

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



It is I, Francis of Assisi. I come in the light and the Love of the Heavenly Father with my friends. Whatever riches you have possessed in the material world, please know they will not buy you a single moment of paradise in the spirit world. 

Be humble in your walk, have faith and believe in the knowing that God loves all his children, whether they be saint or sinner. Regardless of race or creed or color, regardless of country or tribe or continent. For the soul’s home is beyond all those places, all those things, all those identifications that one may be. 

A communion of souls in the Love of God is the great family that all belong to. Let your aspirations rise, forgive yourselves as you forgive others. Ask God to heal you, to bestow the gift of his great Love upon you for we are all one, brothers and sisters, in the Love of God. This is a great truth, this is undeniable. And when you are in God’s Grace all that is not love falls away. All are brothers, all are sisters, in this family of Divine Love. We welcome all, that God may bless all. Come and join us. 

With all my love and blessings in the great Love of the Father, I am your brother in Christ, Francis from Assisi, now an inhabitant of the Celestial Heavens and a Divine Angel. God bless you.
