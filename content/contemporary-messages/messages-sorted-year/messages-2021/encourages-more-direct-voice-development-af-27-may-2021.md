# Encourages More Direct Voice Development in the World

My dear brother is rather surprised to see me as I was on Earth, and that I had dark skin as I was Nubian<sup>1</sup> when I lived upon your planet many thousands of years ago. Now my skin is lighter, as it is with all who are within the Celestial Kingdom. We have a complexion that is of a common color when we choose to don our spirit bodies, for there are times when we do not and we are purely of the light of the soul existing in these planes so infinite and wondrous in nature. 

Beloved souls, I am very happy that you are considering and speaking of these times to come when we will work together once again for the establishment of Direct Voice. I would suggest that those who are interested and who have ascribed to this program, as you would call it, will come together on a weekly basis in prayer no matter where they are in the world. You may set a time aside for one hour in order to pray for the preparation and the establishment of Direct Voice. That way, those who would come will be attuned to one another and some preliminary work has been established amongst you.
I see in the future there will be a core group of individuals who will assure the continuation of this development for many years to come and that there will be an outer ring of individuals who will come from different parts of the world and will be assisted in the development of this gift within them. So this commitment will not be just for some weeks but for many, many months and years so that we may establish this gift on Earth through many individuals as they are dispersed throughout the world. 

It is important that you realize the breadth and depth of this commitment together and that you will be able to see the need and the dedication that is required from you in order to establish this nucleus of souls who will be developed in a powerful way so as to stimulate the awakening of these gifts in others. We are very pleased that there are those of you who are willing to establish this important group of dedicated souls. 

May you find yourselves open, receptive and eager to do so. It will not take over your life as you may fear but it will be a serious component of your life. Much will be asked of you in service, in giving to your brothers and sisters, in guiding and mentoring those who wish to be a part of these expressions of service for God. 

Here, my beloved daughter, we are establishing a portal. It will be important in coming years as you invite others to come share with you the light that is established here. Many will feel the peace and the blessings that will come as you continue to pray and bring light into your midst. May you all continue to grow in the Father’s Love, to find all the expressions of this soul that is becoming awakened and express your gifts accordingly. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your Seretta Kem who will be by your side for my commitment to your efforts is great. It is a joy and a blessing to be a part of it, to have this established on Earth. What a great boon this will be to humanity, that they may awaken to the Truth of God’s Love, to the Truth that there is indeed so much available to each individual on Earth, provided they are receptive and wish to know and be a part of the great evolving, growing light that is in your world and will flow to many. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am close as are many of us who work in alignment with the Will of God for the establishment of light and truth upon this world. God bless you and keep you close, close in the light, close in the love, close to God embraced always. God bless you.
