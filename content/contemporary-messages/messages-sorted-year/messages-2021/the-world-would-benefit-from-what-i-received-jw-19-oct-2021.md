I am here Robert Lees. My dear friends you can see that what I was given was in truth. And where there is error, it is insignificant compared to the great truth of what I received, which is God’s love. Yes, the world would benefit from what I received being out there and available and as I have said, should you choose to promote these truths, that would be wonderful. For as they are a blessing for you, they may be a blessing for many. The uniqueness of every soul searching for truth, opening to God’s love allows for a variety of understandings. The difference between what I received and what James Padgett received, and Rev Owens, and dear Eileen and others allows different individuals to have insight into the great truths of progression through the spirit world in the many mansions of the Father’s Kingdom. For all souls retain their uniqueness and each one comes to that realization in their own way. So, these literary avenues created to inspire each soul, are an expression of the fullness and diversity that brings one to Oneness with our Creator. For all these that I speak of lead to God’s love and the Celestial heavens. 

As always, I thank you for honoring me and I am grateful that you can perceive the essence of what is contained in what I received. May you continue to grow in God’s Grace and His Love and His truth and be aligned with His magnificent will in which all things have their being and their source. May the Essence of God’s love be yours. With all my love and blessings and gratitude. I am Robert Lees. God bless you.
