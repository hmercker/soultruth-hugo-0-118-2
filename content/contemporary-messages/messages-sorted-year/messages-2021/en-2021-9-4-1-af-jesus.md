Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved soul, I am Jesus. I come to be with you in prayer today for is this not a momentous day as you begin your journeys to come together? So you are being blessed by God, guided by God upon your journeys. The great journey of the awakening of the soul is about to take another turn where new discoveries will come. New awakenings will bring its fresh start within your consciousness, a new understanding, new capacities to love and to be loved.

You are opening a door, beloveds, that will remain open. It will be difficult to close this door again. You embark upon a new chapter of your life, an exciting and heartfelt chapter that is a deeper dedication to your Heavenly Father, a deeper dedication to your own soul’s progression as you come together to pray to receive the blessing of God’s Love, and also to seek in the ways that your gifts may be of service to your Heavenly Father and to all of humanity.

God has touched each one of your souls deeply. God continues to awaken you. God’s Love for you becomes more evident with each day as you awaken to this great Source of Love. We walk together, beloved souls. It is your time in fervent prayer and dedication that will bring all these blessings forth. It is your time to allow God to pull aside the veils that hold you from true understanding and experience of God. You will travel the road less traveled, beloved souls, and you will come to find your way upon a path that is both unique but is shared amongst you. Together we shall walk together. We are truly brothers and sisters with the same desires, the same dedication as we pray together and the unfolding of our souls, at-onement with God, His plan to be revealed, His Will to be known. The time for the healing of your world and the healing of your own souls begins in earnest.

May God bless you on that journey, beloved souls, awaken you in the fullness of love and the Grace of God’s Touch upon you and the wonderment of a soul awakening to the truth and the beauty of the expression of your true gifts of the service of mankind. May God bless you, beloveds, keep you in His Love, envelop you in His Light and Presence. I am with you in prayer. Many surround you in prayer. Many in the world of spirit and the Celestial Kingdom anticipate this time of miracles and blessings upon you and upon humanity. God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother. I am with you. I am Jesus. God bless you.
