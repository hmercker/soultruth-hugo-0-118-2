Jesus received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, beloveds, I am Jesus. I have been with you in your conversations and I am pleased to see a harmony and love that you share amongst you and that indeed you are beginning to feel the impetus of your efforts and the possibilities that may come from them.

Your souls are welling up with joy and emotion and a sense of direction. Your purpose is to validate the soul, my beloved brothers and sisters, to help your brothers and sisters to see within themselves that part that, as the dear brother indicates, they are blind to and do not truly know it exists. You are given the task to find creative ways to open doors, to engage others in this pursuit of awakening to the possibilities of the soul and to the possibilities of the soul's communication with God. Although the outcomes are simple and clear, the journey towards these goals can be challenging indeed in a world that refuses to open their eyes to these possibilities.

It is the power of your own soul, my beloveds, to express and know these truths with such clarity and commitment and experience that there is no doubt or confusion. You will share your strength with many. You will share your wisdom with many. You will share your love with many. Indeed the times will come where you will travel the world and touch many souls. These discussions and preparations that you make now pave the way for future events and efforts that are coming and guided by God. Have patience with yourselves and one another. Know that the foundations have been laid, that each of you are well aware of the importance of bringing this truth to humanity. And in this awareness I ask you to be of good faith and to exercise patience and forbearance. Indeed the timing of your efforts and the construction of what it is that you are creating together will take time and consideration. Not so much the consideration and analysis of the mind but to allow the depth of this purposeful effort to sink deep within your souls eliciting a response, a flowing of truth and knowledge and inspiration that will come forth as you are ready to receive it.

May you continue to ascribe to God's plan for the salvation of humanity and realize that you may play an important part, a part that will be effective and far reaching. This has already been ordained by God, and it is for you to understand what God has placed within your souls that will bring about the expression and realization of God's plan for each of you. Indeed you must go deep and you must stretch yourselves beyond that comfortable place of a mind's knowing and ideals to a place of the soul's understanding and knowing. Make efforts each day to walk in the realm that is still in need of great discovery; to experience your own soul and relationship with God. It comes faintly at first, almost unrecognizable, but indeed as you journey on with your focus and efforts upon this great need to know your own soul, then indeed God will open up the avenues by which you may know this and know it well.

You are my disciples, beloved souls. Know this, that truly I am with you and we work together in God's plan to awaken humanity to the truth and in this all that is required will come. The power and strength, the love and inspiration will all come to you and through you, reaching many souls. It is for you now to awaken, to make that great effort in prayer and contemplation, to truly know yourselves, to open up that avenue between your mind and your soul so that all comes clearly and succinctly as God feeds you what you are in need of, the insights and truth that are awaiting you. It is for you to sit, ask, and receive. This is simple indeed but in your busy lives often that quiet time is elusive. Dedicate yourselves in prayer, and dedicate yourselves to one another for you are truly a family within God's great family of love and you are a part of a great mission, a great mission indeed to awaken humanity, to help God to heal the world and disperse the darkness.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother and your friend. I come to bless you and encourage you forward and assure you that you are a part of a great plan. Indeed your strength, your commitment, your honesty and sincerity will carry you far upon this road. May your faith grow. May your souls continue to awaken. May you come to see yourselves as truly a child of God and a servant to humanity. God bless you. I am your brother. I walk with you and my love is with you, beloved souls. God bless you.
