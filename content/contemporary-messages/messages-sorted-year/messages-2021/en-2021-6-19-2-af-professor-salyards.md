Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Professor Salyards. You will be surprised at what portals and doors and opportunities will open to you as you continue to progress down this road. So you will see how God will guide you and open up the way for you to connect, to be in association, to help to teach and to inspire many souls. This is a lifelong commitment that you are engaged upon with this program.

Indeed, it starts slowly and gradually but I tell you it will build, though as our dear sister indicates, it is not for you to worry about how or when or how many may come, merely to put yourself in the path of God's will and allow His will to open those doors and opportunities so that you may serve. With the correct attitude and the soulful longing to be God's servant in the world, so these things will manifest. They will manifest in harmony and they will manifest in ways that link one to another like roots growing from a tree continuing to spread into the soil. So your connections will spread in this way, in an organic unfolding that does follow a plan which becomes part of God's plan. So you will find yourselves upon this road, often surprised, sometimes a sense of disappointment to your expectations, but in the long term there will be many souls touched as this root system grows in the world, connecting many to you. There is much to be considered, that you are indeed doing much to bring wisdom and clarity and beauty and love, to do so in powerful ways as you walk upon this road.

Beloved, beloved and beautiful souls, know that you are continually blessed and guided and will be blessed and guided. There is no cause for concern and I do not see any concern amongst you, only a desire to have your place secured in this effort and opportunity of service. And so you are secure, beloved souls. You are secure and blessed and guided and so it shall be now and always. As you seek to be with God, so God seeks to express His Love through you, to guide you into directions that will help and uplift many in Light.

God bless you, beloved and beautiful souls, I am Professor Salyards. I am happy that you come together in your earnestness, in this desire to serve, to love, to bring greater light and truth. We are together in this, united, and shall be within the great flow of God's Love and Truth and intention. From now to the day you leave this earth, so you will be guided. God bless you, my friends, God bless you and keep you in His Love. I am with you often. God bless you.
