Stephen received by Al Fike

Dear Beloved Souls, I am Stephen, known as St. Stephen in your world. I come to encourage you all upon your journeys in life to realize that you are never alone; that no matter what conditions you encounter in your life and indeed, as the world continues to darken and present great challenges to you all, know that God is always with you, that you may rely upon God’s uplifting blessing, His Love, to be with you and to strengthen you. And I urge you to hold fast to your understanding and beliefs, in the power of Love to heal, the great Touch of God to awaken your soul. That even though you may find resistance amongst those in your world who do not know these Truths, I urge you forward, for this Truth must be known. In order for the world to change and conditions to be reversed from darkness to Light, the Truth must be spoken; not in harsh words or insistent language, but in Love.

To be an example of Love in the world, beautiful souls that you are, is the greatest gift you can offer. To be a channel of Love in the world, being used by God’s great Hand to be guided and to touch others in blessings and peace and Love, is a great blessing to your own soul. Walk in Light, beloved friends. Be the Light in the world that you wish the world to be. Walk with your head high and your heart full of gratitude and awareness that you are indeed deeply blessed and that indeed you may show and teach others how this blessing may be obtained. For now is the time for the awakening of humanity. Now is the time for those of you who know this Truth to put aside your reticence. Put aside your fear of judgement. Put aside your lack of self-esteem and love and walk forward in faith, knowing God will guide you, that God will use you as a channel to bring blessings to many souls in need. For there are indeed many souls who require your ministrations as God’s instruments.

Are you brave enough and strong enough to step forward? Many who have done so have paid the price. I did, paid the price in my day; though it is doubtful that you would pay such a heavy price. But indeed, as conditions worsen in your world, you will encounter great scorn and resistance from others. For when humanity is faced with such crises, such difficult conditions, there are those who would deny and hide away from the Truth, those who are angry and blame others, those who are fearful and cannot face what is the reality of today. The great antidote to these conditions and responses is love and strength and Truth.

May you walk forward in the days to come in this new year which you celebrate and make this commitment to be God’s channels of Love and Truth in the world, to assist humanity in its awakening, to guide your brothers and sisters forward into Light. It can be done as you exercise your faith and walk in the Light yourselves, not succumbing to the human condition, but rising above it and walking as God’s channels in a world that needs each and every one of you, beloved souls.  Awaken to your potentials, your light, your love that rests within your souls and all will unfold in the grace of God, reflecting your own inner, true inner desire to be God’s servants and to serve your brothers and sisters in the great Love and Light that is meant to be in the world. Express this. Be an example. Be strong and know that Love will conquer all.

May God bless you. I am Stephen and I come to bring you a blessing, beloved souls, as one of the Angels of Heaven who come to assure you that God is with you. You are not alone. Along with this great blessing of God’s Hand upon you, know that His angels surround you and will walk with you, provided you are in alignment with God’s Will and know the blessing of His Love. God bless you beloved souls, and keep you in this year ahead in Light and protection, Truth and Love. All blessings upon you, all blessings for each of you and through you to the world. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with you. God bless you.
