Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

This is your Professor Salyards. Be assured, my beloved beautiful friends, that there is a plan and that your challenge and your invitation is to be aware, to absorb and express this plan through your mutual endeavors. Much is coming that will indeed keep you all busy and engaged in these efforts to bring the truth of Divine Love to humanity. It will flow, my beloved and beautiful friends, it will flow and be evident without too much to-ing and fro-ing regarding details.

When you work for God it is not so much that it is work, rather it is service and expression and a flow of love that nourishes all involved. In this way you are uplifted, in this way you come to that place of understanding, of clarity, of truth and of joy. So it will come to each of you a sense of direction, a sense of expression, of utilizing your gifts, of stepping forward and being present as teachers, healers, channels of love for your brothers and sisters. It will not be complicated, my friends. I know there are things about your earthly plane that require your attention and your engagement but provided you are in a prayerful state these things will not seem onerous or difficult, rather they will be within that great flow of God's Will and plan, the upliftment of humanity.

So my friends, continue to pray to allow His Will to work through you, to be receptive and open to God's Will and most of all, dare we say it my friends, continue in your prayers for God's Love to enter your souls for this clears that channel of God's communication and makes it something that is vital and valuable to your efforts. All is being given so you will know as you continue on this journey of awakening and of service, you will know your part to play, you will know what you are meant to say and be a true teacher, channel, harbinger of truth in the world.

May God bless you on that journey. May you come to know your true selves as never before and that as you place your trust and faith in God so these things will manifest and unfold in the timing and beautiful harmony that is meant to be in this journey and project of serving humanity. God bless you, my friends, I am with you. Know that I am with you all and many are with you in this great effort to serve humanity, to bring greater light and love, to be God's instruments in the world. So you shall be, so it will unfold, my beloved friends. God bless you, I am your Professor Salyards and shall continue to guide and reassure and try to inspire towards greater light. God bless you.
