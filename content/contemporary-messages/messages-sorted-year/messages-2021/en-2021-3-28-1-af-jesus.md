# Blessing 1

March 28<sup>th</sup>, 2021

General Collection, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Come, my brothers and sisters, come with me and bathe in the waters of God’s Love that we may immerse ourselves in this liquid joy and light and love, that we may truly be in harmony with all that is of light, that we may come to know God with ever deeper perceptions and experiences which open the door to truth, that we may be God’s children together. In this ring of light we betroth to each other our love for one another. We come and find unity in the great power of love. Together we are a force to reckon with in the world, together we come to bring change, to ignite healing and peace and truth in the world. With the power of love, so we are a force for light. In our efforts together we are truly blessed and love reigns supreme within us and around us.

May God bless us all upon this journey, upon our efforts. Together we are all strong and instruments for God. Bathe in this holy Light, beloved souls, bathe in the great blessings of God and know that your souls are being deeply touched at this moment. You are being awakened, uplifted, loved by God. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to bless you this day. May you feel and know this blessing and may it sustain you for times to come. I am with you, I am with you, beloved souls, I am with you.
