# Infinite Ocean

June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here Hafiz

Standing on the shore
 
Of the Infinite Ocean

Wave after wave 

Of uninvited thoughts and desires come

Enough to drown
 
Even the most competent swimmer


And yet one struggles 

To traverse the great sea

To fathom its depths
 
As I float on the raft 

Of Divine Grace

Unafraid to drown 

In His love
 
To merge with the very substance

Of the Eternal One

On the Infinite Ocean
 
Of Love

Wonâ€™t you join me for a dip?
