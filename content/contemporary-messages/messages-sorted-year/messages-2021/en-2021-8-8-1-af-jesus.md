# Be a light in the world

August 8<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to encourage you to dig deep within your soul to unearth those parts of yourself that deeply desire the blessings from God. It is in this deep and sincere longing for God that the powerful blessings of His Love come into you. Each of you continue upon this path in your own way and your own pace and yet our desire is that your pace quickens with each breath, with each day, so that you may come closer into alignment with your Heavenly Father, that you may find yourself in greater harmony with all that is of God's Creation, with the laws of God's Love, so that each day God may utilize your gifts and your efforts to be an instrument of light and love, of healing and comfort for your brothers and sisters. The light will spread with acts of love, kindness, embracing your brothers and sisters, putting aside your own judgments, and allowing the great Love of God to flow through you unimpeded.

In this way you will touch other souls, in this way more will come and join you in prayer. It is the act of reaching out to another soul that opens the door to their acceptance and desire for the blessings of God's Love, for you become his active agents in the world. Do not hide from your brothers and sisters, do not bring yourself to a place of reticence and fear from the conditions of this world. But when you set forth in this world with the prayer and desire to be God's instrument, then you are protected and guided. Your intentions will bring you to many places as your intentions turn and transform into guided action, thought and deed, so that many will be reached and touched with this truth. It may merely be a glance, a smile, a look within your eyes of love, a prayer uttered, a touch of comfort, a small gesture. All of these things brighten another soul.

All of these things, done with the intention of being God's instruments open the door for his blessings to flow. Allow yourself to be a pure and beautiful instrument of God's Will and God will open many doors of service, no matter where you are, whether you be upon a busy street or within the halls of the church or elsewhere. There are many opportunities that God will lay before you, given your attitude of openness and desire to serve. The power of love will enhance all that you do. As you continue to grow in this love, what you do is reflected and brightened by God's Touch of Love. Beloved souls, be God's instruments upon this world, a world in need of love, a world that is lost in much darkness. You are the blessed ones, you are the ones who found their way to light, you have the knowledge and the means to neutralize the darkness around you.

How many in your life do you know who have this knowledge and blessing? How many do you see who stumble in the darkness of their own ignorance, of this muffled desire of the soul unacknowledged and recognized? Yet when you are present as a pure light and channel of God's Love, you help that individual to recognize the longings of their soul. The bell toll comes as you continue to align yourself with God. Recognize and acknowledge that God needs and utilizes your gifts, your presence, your instrumentality to help manifest His plan for the salvation of humanity.

And, as you well know, we are with you to help reinforce the light, to help guide you upon the path that God has designated for each of you, to be with you in your daily affairs and concerns so that indeed those opportunities are not passed by but are utilized to bring greater light to the world.

So much is given to you, beloved souls, you who have chosen light, you who have recognized the power of love, you who have reached God in prayer and supplication, bringing forth the desire to serve humanity. May you continue upon that journey, beloved souls, a journey that is filled with opportunity to serve in love.

We are God's Children together, beloved souls, and we continue to serve God in love and light, channels of His blessings to the world. May we all work together in unison and harmony. The power of our collaboration just begins to manifest in the world and will grow in depth and breadth. It will be a magnificent effort to bring love to the world. You are all part of this great effort as God continues to bless us all and bring us together in these ways and means. You are my brothers and sisters. You are the brothers and sisters of many angels who reside within the Celestial Kingdom and you are a light in the world.

May God bless you deeply, beloveds, deeply. Awaken your souls, come to know your true selves and your true destinies and all will unfold in harmony with God's Will and Love. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you, never to leave, always by your side as we conquer the earth in love and light and truth, in harmony that manifests through God's blessings. God bless you. I am with you. God bless you, beloveds. I love you.
