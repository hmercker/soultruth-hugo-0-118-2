# Our Soul's Desires in Alignment with God's Will

September 17<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Salome received by Al Fike

...I am Salome. How wonderful it is to come and pray together in this Circle of Light, that through your prayers you draw us close, through your efforts you elicit the blessings of God within your Circle and bring greater light to this world. It takes your efforts in prayer, your deep desire to bring God's blessings, to attune yourself to the great blessing of God's Love entering your souls that this Light is possible and that we are unified in these efforts. Though you're limited in your vision, you sense the immensity of this collective effort, not only from yourselves but from many spirits who have deep intentions and desires to bring light to your world, and the Celestial Kingdom that is praying unceasingly for these efforts and the efforts of those who do not dwell upon this Earth but yet are in the physical. It is truly immense, beloved souls, truly immense and wondrous in scope.

And it is all because you have stepped forth in desire, willingness and love to do God’s Will upon this Earth, and so you will, my beloved friends, and so you will, and what is possible through our efforts together is also beyond the scope of your imaginings. But all it takes is one step forward, one effort made, one desire realized, and that is that we will do God’s Will upon this world. The power of this, beloved souls, is what you must teach to others, that when one steps forward in this way, it is an act of faith, it is an act of the soul hearing the call of God to act in light. To be a light, and to express as light and truth and love in the world, in soul to soul response, and reach towards God for that Holy Embrace, soul to soul, that beautiful blessing comes through the instrumentality of God's Holy Spirit upon you, upon your soul.

It is so very simple and elegant and wondrous to be in that place where God's Presence is felt, to be in a place where the Touch of His Love awakens your soul and brings your soul into harmony with His Great Soul. This alignment grows and expands as you continue to reach for it, and we utilize this alignment of souls in order to do our work together. The power of love is great and the power of God's Love is immense. As you continue to draw this power to your circle and into your souls, you increase the possibilities of what may be accomplished amongst you.

You are intrepid voyagers upon a wondrous journey, and you do so because your souls are both intrigued and excited by these possibilities. Your souls sense this wondrous journey and what may come of it, and there is a leaping of joy, of wonderment, of gratitude and love, as you walk upon this path, somewhat naïve, somewhat blinded, somewhat ignorant. Yet it is that yearning of your souls, that desire within you that continues to motivate you forward and bring the impetus that is required for us to be together in harmony and unity. Together with God we venture forward. Together with God we may accomplish many things. For the great blessings of God's Love, His Will, His beautiful energies of the Soul will manifest through each of you and through all of you together to bring about many blessings of light, of peace, change, love, truth, awakening, to your world.

God bless you on this journey, my beloved friends, and I thank you with all of my love from the very depths of my soul for your efforts, your commitment, and your desire. The power of your soul can change the world, in alignment with God’s Will. God bless you, beloveds, I am Salome and I love you dearly. God bless you all, beloved souls.
