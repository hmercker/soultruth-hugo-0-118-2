# Pray with Loving Intention and Motivation

May 16<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

My precious and beloved friends, I thank you for your prayers and your intentions today. My name is Mylora. I have a gift of healing. Deep in my heart, God has created a great sense of compassion and love for humanity and for all the spirits and the angels of our world.

So with those things within my heart and my desires of the soul to bring comfort and healing to many, you have drawn me into your midst. I, in my gifts and my abilities as a Celestial angel, will visit each and every one of your loved ones of those you pray for and minister to them in light.

You see when you put your thoughts towards blessings and love that flow out to your loved ones into this world so you add a beautiful light, and you open channels of possibilities for the blessings of many. We call you a Circle of Light Indeed, in the circle, when unified in this way in prayer and desire and intention, so it creates a beautiful portal of blessings, light, and love that does indeed go out to many places in the world.

Know that your prayers are being answered, my beloved friends. Know that all that you ask for is heard and is known by God. When it is done in the highest way, with the highest of intentions, with love and compassion for all, so you have added your power to these prayers and allowed this portal of blessings to be opened.

These laws must be obeyed. These laws are important to know. It is the power of your feeling, your intention, and your thought which adds to this outpouring of God's blessings to the world.  So you have drawn me and many angels into your midst. In so doing, you have drawn many blessings and upliftments to yourselves.

May you know deep peace this day, my friends. Know the soothing comfort of the Father's Touch upon you. Know the upliftment that comes with His healing Touch.  Know the expansion within your heart and soul that comes with His blessing of Love and all these beautiful bright and wondrous gifts and blessings upon you which God gives in such abundance and serve to add to your spiritual progress and awakening of your soul for as you awaken the soul, the possibilities of your instrumentality, a channel of love which is you, may grow and expand, its power added to with each drop of Love within your soul. It brings an alignment with God and with one another and with your angel friends and the bright spirits who work with you all. The power of Love unifies, beloveds. The power of Love opens, expands, and brings forth the many opportunities and possibilities of God's blessings upon you and upon humanity.

We rely upon your prayers as well, or without your efforts in prayer, without your intentions clear, without your desires pure, it is difficult for us to work with you and through you for the benefit of others. So I encourage you to continue to see within yourself these things which are a barrier to God and to release these things. In so doing, you become less human and more divine as you grow in the Father's Love and allow that transformative power to change your soul, to remake your being so that you are in a refinement, a quality, an expression that is more of the soul as touched by God's great Soul, and less of the courser human condition that so predominates your world.

In time you will become in the world but not of the world. In this way, you become a powerful channel of love, of truth, of light in your world. In this way, as others join you in this light and this transformation, so you will be a formidable force for the salvation of your world, which as you know is God's plan.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Mylora. May you continue to forge ahead in light, to be in love, to truly feel and know the Love of God, to be in that place of joy, that place of knowing, that firm and wondrous sense that you are claimed by God.

May God bless you, beloveds, a blessing for each one of you to bring comfort and healing to your being, to be in the light and uplifted in love. God is with us all. Know this, feel this, breathe it in, and know you are His children. God bless you, God bless you beloveds. Thank you for listening to me today and allowing me to come. My love is with you. God bless you.
