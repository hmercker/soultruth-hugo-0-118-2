We are so very pleased, beloved and beautiful souls. I am Seretta Kem. Yes, I will be spearheading our efforts as I have done in the past and so I will do in the future. I am pleased to envelop and embrace all of you who are interested and committed to this great venture. As our beloved friends have spoken of, it is a deep commitment but is also very much in alignment with your souls and the progress of your souls because as you continue to pray for the Father’s Love to awaken you, so these gifts may come into alignment and be manifest through you. 

The effort made in prayer, which is a deep commitment with each one of you, is the foundation for all work that we do, as those of us in the Celestial Kingdom work with you upon the Earth plane. It must be so for it cannot be manifest or expressed without this deep commitment of the soul to receive and know the blessing of God’s Divine Love, for as you know, this is an incremental and ongoing effort to grow your soul. 

Do not have any illusions, that your souls are completely formed and in that place of harmony with God, and no effort in this way is needed. These are the illusions of your minds speaking to you. Each of you must continue to grow your soul substantially in prayer and effort to be with God, asking God to bless your soul, and for God to bless those faculties and aspects within your soul that will be crucial in the development of this gift. 

It is within your desire and your efforts and the expression of your it that these things will come to be. Your souls know well what it is that they are committing to. Simply put, it is all in service to God and service to humanity. This focus upon specific gifts and manifestations is in harmony provided that your primary focus is upon growing your soul and continues to be at the forefront of your efforts. The combination of your mind’s desire and the acceptance of these efforts of it coming together in harmony is required so as to work with us in developing these manifestations and spiritual skills, shall I say, so that you may assist us in making contact and communication with humanity. 

When we do so in accordance to the plans that are being laid and in harmony with God’s plan which is being implemented at this time, many manifestations and wonderful blessings will come to many souls  - souls that would not otherwise be receptive and open to your words, souls that are curious, souls who are imploring their mindful selves to look deeper into spiritual truths. It is the impetus within the soul that interests us in our work and is a part of your work to stimulate and inspire many to go deeper within themselves and to reach God in these explorations, prayers and attempts to free themselves from the burdens and chains of the human condition. 

You have gone far upon that journey, and you will continue to slough off those conditions that inhibit what it is that you and we wish to accomplish together. This journey will be full of surprises, interesting experiences, visions, and manifestations. It will be a magnificent journey that none upon your world at this time are partaking of. Yet, you have come together and affirmed your desire to do so. So we affirm our desire to work with you and to be with you as you explore the potentials of your soul awakening in God’s Love. 

We are with you, beloved souls. We are very happy with your efforts and your conversation. May you continue to explore the possibilities of coming together and seeking to work with us in a spiritual, material, and soulful way to bring about this gift manifest in all its power and glory and beauty for the benefit of mankind. That all may see for themselves God’s great Love manifesting in light, in wonderment, in joy, in truth, and the embodiment of Truth. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your Seretta Kem. I am with you often and shall continue to work with you all upon the many ventures that you have dedicated yourselves to express a spiritual work, spiritual expression, and dedication, and your love for God, your love for humanity. God bless you. God bless you all. Seretta Kem loves you dearly. God bless you.
