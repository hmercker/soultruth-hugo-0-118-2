# True Happiness

September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, HI, USA

Care Darby Walsh received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the Grace of God’s Love be upon you each. May his most Holy Spirit bring His Love into your souls that you may be with us in the peace beyond human understanding, beyond the busyness of this world, and all its enticements, entanglements, and troubles. I tell you with all the Love in my soul that the more time you spend in prayer, reaching out with your soul for this gift of God’s Love the more everything, every good and perfect gift, will be given to you. What is truth becomes apparent, and what is in error falls away. If you wish for real happiness beyond even the momentary pleasures of this world, all that you need to do is stay open to God’s love. You may still enjoy the world, but consider your priorities.

If I told you that the gift of God’s Love was a zillion times more than any earthly gift, any lottery winnings, any possessions, all of which fall into dust; would you believe me? This wonderful gift is Divine Love, and with the gift of free will you are not compelled to receive it, but what a choice what a treasure it is! Real happiness, real joy, real healings, are yours for the asking in God’s Love. I love you. I am your sister, and friend, and grandmother, and beloved, who once lived upon earth as a barefoot prayer warrior, and now inhabits the Celestial Heavens as an angel, your angel. Go with God, go in peace, bring joy to this world. I am Care.
