Augustine received by Al Fike

Greetings to you all. I am your teacher, Augustine. May the Father’s Love continue to flow into your souls, beloved and precious souls of light in the world. You are important because you have attuned yourself to the highest and most powerful truth in the universe. You have come to acknowledge something that is so important and so powerful that it can change the world.

Yes, many will come to you and many are seeking. As God continues to pour His blessings upon this world, so the souls are ignited and drawn. Like a magnet, they are drawn to you who carry the key, who come with the simple message of the truth of God’s blessing to the soul.

So, you will find as conditions intensify that many more will be drawn. I urge you to accept their desire to connect and be with you, to tell them the simple truth, to be a harbinger of this truth and love for the blessings and benefit of strangers and loved ones alike. How else can this message come, than with a kind word, a gentle touch, a look within your eye that says, *“I sincerely hope and desire that you come to understand the redeeming qualities of God’s Love within your soul”?*

There is much that you can convey in a short period of time. As we work with those individuals who are drawn to you. Indeed, there are times when you may follow-up with those individuals and have further and deeper conversations, even building a bond that may last for a life-time and beyond. God will put many souls on your path. God will clear the way so many souls may indeed come close.

There is always a blessing to be given, a connection to be made soul-to-soul without words, without acknowledgment in a conscious way. Within your sleep state, you are connecting with many souls. You are being used in many ways. God’s plan for the salvation of humanity is such that He utilizes all avenues, all opportunities, all possibilities to bring light to His children.

The greatest barrier is that of the conscious mind accepting God and accepting the Truth of His Love. This is so perplexing for us in the Celestial Kingdom to see how so many reject this Truth, not only in your world but in the worlds of spirit and in the heaven of the Sixth Sphere, so many who are engaged within the mental reckonings and do not completely legitimize the soul by its awakening and opening to God. This is not only the way of the world but the way of many worlds for humanity insists upon its own power, glory and glorification through what man has built rather than what God has created.

Yet, there are those souls who feel the draw, the magnetism of the Light of God’s Love within another. How gratifying it must be for you who make this connection and there is an acknowledgment. There is a bond created between you. Come to know that God has made this possible and that almost in all situations, He has sent an angel to assure that this connection may be made.

We see the light in others. We see their souls. We understand their soul condition. In this, we see the possibility of connecting one soul to another. We work diligently to expedite this potential. So, when you walk through the world, you are signaling to God, to your celestial angel friends, and to those who are seeking that you are available to be a channel of His Love and Truth in the world and that indeed, there are times when God will take advantage of this possibility and open the road to connection.

When a soul truly desires truth, God will find a way to bring truth to that individual. You may be one of the instruments that God will use for this to be so. When you can bring another to this truth, is this not another jewel set in your crown? Is this not another accomplishment that will engender greater light within you and within your journey? Consider the possibilities, beloved souls, the opportunities that God sets before you to bring this truth.

You may broadcast many seeds upon the Earth plane. Some will be absorbed and germinate within the individual while others will cast this aside and not appreciate your efforts. Do not judge those who reject this truth. Rather, know that you are engaged in God’s work and that you have done your part, willingly and with love for in this, the world will be changed, the truth will grow, and many will come to know this in a conscious way and practice it overtly and powerfully within their lives.

Someone brought you to the truth, beloved souls. May the chain of truth continue through you to another and another and another so that the whole world is ablaze in love, in light, in joy, in the freedom that comes with a soul awakened. So, the world will be transformed by the great blessings of God’s wondrous Soul, imparting His Love through the Holy Spirit to another who desires this Touch.

May you all receive His Love at this moment, His blessings upon you all. God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am happy to come to you today to encourage you forward for now is the time to be God’s instruments in the world, to step forward with courage and bravery, clarity and love for the benefit of your brothers and sisters. God bless you and keep you strong, keep you in the light, envelop you in love. God bless you.
