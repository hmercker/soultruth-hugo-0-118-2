# Love of God opens the Heart and Transforms the Soul

April 26<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I come in the presence of the Most Holy God of all. The God of love. For is it not love that brings you here? Is it not love that heals? Is it not love that lifts your soul up? Does not this love of God bring faith? Is it not the answer to your hopes your dreams your desires to be transformed in love, to be changed? 

It is love, the love of God, that opens the heart, that transforms the soul so that at some point you are lifted above this world, lifted above your material concerns in the bliss and glory that is yours for your souls asking, your soulsâ€™ longings. It is this great love of God that permeates this circle of light and brings many, many, many, in the spirit world, attracted to the light. And although some would not hear me in the spirit world they come to this realm attracted, as I say, to the light and the love here in this circle.     
     
I say to all, allow God to open up your souls with His most Holy Spirit to bestow this gift of love that you feel in this moment, in this Presence. Have faith, trust. For God so loves all of you and showers you with this great gift in this moment and beyond. Your intention is true. May the great peace and glory of the love of God be yours and all here. I thank you my dear ones. With all my love and blessings from Above. I am your friend and brother in Christ. I am Luke.
