Blessed be the children. It is easy to have empathy for the little ones because you can feel their innocence, their curiosity, their lack of certain filters that adults possess, and the lack of those walls that we (adults) have built for protection. Children are like open books and when you engage with them in love you are always on the right page in the perfect part of the story. Parents begin to see their lives in terms of their children and wonder, will they be safe, will they be blessed, will they succeed? And for those of you in Divine Love, I know you wish for their spiritual needs to be fulfilled, for them to be touched as you have been. It is only natural to wish material success for those you love, and for all to have food, and shelter, and safety. These things are not unimportant.
 
When one is preoccupied with survival in one sense it is very hard to focus on anything else. And yet when you look around the world, those who live in poverty, those who are on the margins of society, are often the most connected to God. They, having realized their needs, reach out and often those prayers rise above their material needs to a simple: *“Dear God please help me, please bless me, protect me.”* This draws the Holy Spirit of God to bring His love, and all of God’s loving embrace, compassion, and mercy to them. If only we could see all regardless of age, color, creed, sex, status, as God’s children.
    
In His Grace, in His Love, it is impossible to not embrace all. My brothers and I, we did this with great joy. Our vows of poverty bringing us the great riches of the Love of God, every good and perfect gift, all our needs met, many healed, blessed, and so it continues. May your gifts awaken for the sake of the world, for the children, and as this one’s song goes, *“For we are all God’s children, and one in His Love.”* 
  
  
You may feel you are small in number but you are not. And for every blessed soul there is a thousand who benefit. May you each carry this in your walk to all. I thank you. I am your brother in Christ in the eternal Love of God, I am Francis. May God’s Love be with you.
