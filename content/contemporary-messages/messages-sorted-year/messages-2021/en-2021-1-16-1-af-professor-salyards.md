Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

And I am Professor Salyards. I am very pleased that many have a curiosity as to what we are proposing, we in the world of spirit and those of you upon the earth plane, this coalition of forces and gifts and beautiful souls wishing to work together within the Will of God, expressing their talents and gifts to bring the truth of Divine Love into the world.

My friends, we will not let you down. We will not turn away. We will not judge you nor reject you for all those who are willing and wish to join this collective group of bright souls are welcomed and are blessed. We will do our utmost to support you, encourage you, protect you, and help guide you towards the outcomes which are within Godâ€™s Will and plan for you and for all humanity. Do not doubt this, my friends, but know that you are in safe hands, hands of love, competent hands, hands which wish to see the fulfillment of your purpose and destiny in the world.

And so we will give to you what you require for God has blessed us and guided us to do so. And so we will. As we progress together so we will mark our path towards greater light, greater truth, and greater love. So we will walk together in harmony and peace. This is our declaration to you, our beloved friends. May you make this declaration to one another and to God for in this heartfelt desire will come the outcomes that are anticipated and longed for not only by your souls, but all of humanity longs to be released from their pain and darkness, their ignorance, and their struggles. You have the key, beloved souls. You have the key to encourage this journey of liberation and truth, to teach others how to love--love themselves, love creation, to love God. And so you will be set upon a journey of teaching and liberating, of showing the way so that you may truly be the bringers of light in your world.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your Professor Salyards and I play a role within this group to help guide it towards the desire to coalesce and be strong as a group of willing souls to serve God and serve humanity. So we will work together, so we will discover together the great Will of God given to us day by day, moment by moment. God bless you, my friends. God bless you deeply with His Love.
