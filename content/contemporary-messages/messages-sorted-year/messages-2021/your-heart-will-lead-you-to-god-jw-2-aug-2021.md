# Your Heart will Lead You to God

August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2021 

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



May the Grace of our Heavenly Father be upon you as a gentle rain filled with His light and love in the Peace of His Presence. It is indeed simple and yet the human mind tends to analyze. When it comes right down to it, is it not true that you simply wish to feel the Love of God, His Grace, with your soul at one with the Great Soul, letting go of all your concerns, all your issues in the simple bliss of your soul longings connecting with the love of God? I have said before *“This Is the Divine Yoga!”* 

So, though you may wish to reflect upon these moments of Grace, I ask you to simply carry them in your heart. For the mind will do its bidding but the heart shall lead you on this path of soul transformation in Oneness with God. Allow your hearts to open and God will do the rest. Trust, have Faith and be at peace in the sanctity of this circle, this place of refuge from the world on the bridge to the Celestial heavens. 

I am your brother and eternal friend in the love of God. I am Yogananda. God bless you and keep you in His Grace.
