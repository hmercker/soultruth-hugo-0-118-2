Confucius received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my little birds, I am Confucius. I come to bring peace and healing to you, peace and healing to each of you, to calm you and to bring elevation to your emotions and demeanor, to help you come to God, in loving repose to your Creator, to be in alignment with all that is of light, beloved souls. I come to you to bring peace and love.

Beloveds, how blessed you are to have your angel friends and to have God's Touch upon you. Can you imagine life without this gift, these blessings? Can you imagine living a life that is bereft of God? Beloved souls, you have found your way to the great fountainhead of Love. May you feel this blessing infuse your soul and refresh you and awaken you. May you come into the grace of God's Touch so that all is in harmony and joy. May you feel the strength that comes with God's blessings of Light upon you. May you find great peace in the presence of God.

I come to bless you all, precious souls, those who dwell upon this earth, those who are in need of God's Touch, those who at times lose their way in grief, sorrow, are burdened by life's conditions. I come to uplift you, beloved souls, for I am God's instrument and I may come to touch each one of you, beloved souls, for my love for you is great. My love for you is great, beloveds. I come to be with my little birds, so precious in God's sight, my little birds whom I love and I come to nurture and protect, to bring close to my bosom. Beloveds, beloved souls, know that you are loved, that you are truly loved and that I love you. Beloved souls, many love you.

Precious, precious birds, fly to God and sing your songs of praise for you beloved Creator. Precious souls, be in the Light. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you and bring you into peace. Beloveds, beloveds, God bless you.
