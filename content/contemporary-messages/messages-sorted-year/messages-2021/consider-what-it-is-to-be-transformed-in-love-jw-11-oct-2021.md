# Consider What it is to be Transformed in Divine Love

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



My dear brothers and sister in the Love of God, I ask each one to consider from the heart, from their soul, what it is to be transformed in Divine Love, from the mortal to the Divine angel. Though I was considered the first leader of what became the Christian church, I was simply a mortal man touched by the Love of God and a follower of the Master, though three times I denied it.

After the Resurrection and the Pentecost showering of God’s Love, it is fair to say I did indeed become “the Rock”, from Simon to Peter. What has occurred in the centuries that followed this humble beginning is full of light and love and also of sin and error. As your community grows, your church without walls, it is important to remember that each one of you are beloved by God. You have been given much truth, many messages, enough to fill books. You have songs of praise that allow you to open your heart, prayers to carry you. You needn’t depend on any person for your redemption, for your salvation, for your transformation, only God and the truths you have been given. For as in my day and the days that followed, the human nature of men so corrupted the beautiful message of Master Jesus that it took nearly 2000 years to correct it.

Keep the fires burning in your heart, the light in your soul. If you find yourself in doubt, unsure or which way to go, follow the path of love for each soul knows what is love and what is not. The Love of God, may it be your guide in all things, in all ways, beyond the ken of men, the allure of this world, the distractions and manifestations that are presented to you, for in the Love of God, you are lifted above all, beyond this world.

I know of what I speak. I do not wish to demean the work of this one or any other but only to remind you, you are worthy. You are just as much a child of God as any other. Go deep in this prayer. Open your heart that the Holy Spirit of God may open your soul and fill it with Love, Love everlasting.

I shall join you in this prayer and all those here. I am your humble servant, your brother in Christ. I am Simon Peter. Go in peace.
