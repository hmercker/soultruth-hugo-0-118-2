Since you have all been speaking about me, I am here, I am Barbara. I am so pleased to be able to speak through this instrument, my beloved Albert who I nurtured and befriended many, many years ago, and now to see how he has grown into a beautiful light as with his mate, Jeanne. 

How happy I am to see you all come together with a true desire to serve God and to be in the light of God’s Love. I want to assure you that I continue to work with you all, even those who I did not meet in the flesh, please know that I am with you in spirit for I am a very enthusiastic supporter of your work. This work reflects God’s Will and God’s desire to bring the Truth of Divine Love to the world and any effort that you make in this regard, know that many of us are here to support, to uplift, to guide, and to love. You will find this in your daily life as you continue to pray and to ask to be used as an instrument of God’s Love and be God’s servant of Love for your brothers and sisters. 

You will find that an angel will be with you, and bright spirits as well, and all are working towards the fulfillment of God’s great plan to bring salvation to all, to bring enlightenment and healing and peace to all. You will find that as you grow in this Love, as you continue to find your way upon life’s journey and find your purpose in life. Much will unfurl and you will come to know us on this side of life as your dear friends as I knew my angel friends, so close, and who indeed supported me and upheld me even during times of difficulties and times where I was emotionally distraught for I felt things deeply and I could see things that are not pleasant to see in the human condition. It took me a great time to adjust and to be a part of this flow of love in a way that I was comfortable and could work without the burden of the knowledge of what I saw. 

Don’t let your understanding of this material world of yours hold you back from loving, from following God’s guidance and Truth for sometimes it is difficult, sometimes it seems impossible, sometimes we become sorely disappointed in the outcomes of our efforts and prayers. But it is the faith within your heart and soul that will carry you through. For God is always there for you and His Touch upon you brings strength and healing and peace. Those insights will come and as the love grows in your heart there is a deep compassion for all, an understanding of why and how certain individuals act out these dark motivations. Even with them, one becomes compassionate with this understanding and truth. There are great challenges ahead as there always has been in your world, but I wish to say to you that if you persist and you are consistent in your prayers and you build a great faith and love within your heart you will overcome all obstacles and find your way upon the path that God has intended for you. 

I hope that you all support one another in love, for to have this community, this group of lights in the world is going to make a difference in the world and will bring a measure of change in the world and greater light in the world. It relies upon you individually and together to work with God, to bring the healing that is required. The blessings that will rain down upon you and through you to many more.

This is coming my friends, beautiful souls, all of you. I love you all. I love you all and I will continue to work with you all as you continue to seek God’s guidance and to be a channel of His Love in the world. May God bless you on that journey my beautiful and beloved friends. I love you and I thank you all for your efforts and support in bringing about this beautiful organization that is designed to help to support and to bring the Truth of God’s Love to many. God bless you and thank you for listening to me. Thank you, God bless you.
