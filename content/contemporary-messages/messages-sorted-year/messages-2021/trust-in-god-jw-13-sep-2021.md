My dear brothers and sisters, in the Grace of God, I greet you.

You may feel as if you are on a small raft in an infinite ocean adrift at times waiting to sight land. But the Holy Spirit of God is the wind that will carry you in faith to the Celestial shores.

When it is said one must become as a child to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, what is meant, is that as a child trusts in his parents — for safety, for guidance — and humankind must trust in their Creator, the Heavenly Father, that His Will, will supersede perfectly all earthbound solutions because His essence permeates the universe, and His laws are in perfect harmony, perfect equanimity. When you align your hearts in faith, God’s Soul touches your soul and carries it in perfect harmony. How many times have you seen this beautiful grace carry you when you thought all was lost, when you thought your broken heart could not be mended? Through every trial and tribulation when you turn to God there was always a perfect outcome. 
   
One need not deliberate or overanalyze the truths you have been given in a mindful way. Rather take them in with your souls because they do transcend the mind and uplift you into your souls, into harmony, into grace. On earth, it is said: Let go, let God. This is a great truth. I shall step back and join you in your beautiful prayer, for God will shower us with His Grace and His Love. 
    
I am your brother in Christ and eternal friend. I am John. Go in peace.
