# You Rest in the Grace of God

March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2021

General Collection, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Faith Nyquist received by Al Fike

And I too am with you, my friends, I am Faith. I wish to tell you that many angels are with you tonight, that this little circle has a powerful purpose and brings much light to the world. Do not underestimate your abilities and efforts to beseech Godâ€™s blessings, not only to you but to the world. So much can come with a simple prayer. So much is possible when beautiful souls of like mind and whose souls are focused upon service and acting through the Will of God in the world will bring many blessings.

You rest in the grace of God, my friends. Know that I too pray with you, walk with you, and am with you to bring greater light, protection and upliftment to your beautiful souls. God bless you, I am Faith. My love is with you, dear ones, my love is with you. God bless you.
