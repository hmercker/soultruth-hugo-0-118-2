# What if an Angel came to your House

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



What if an angel came to your house

Do you think you’d need all that furniture

That clutters up your place 

To accommodate him? 

No

You would need to remove 

all the clutter

In your heart 

That he may have a place to visit with you

In the Holy Presence 

As a messenger of God 

How else can we spend time with you?

You who are so busy 

Collecting more debris 

We can leap over those walls

That you have so dutifully erected 

But all we ask for is that you unlock the gate 

That leads to the garden 

Where everything blooms 

In the Love of God

In Praise 

In Joy

In Ecstasy 


Come and sit with me

Let your soul 

Be opened 

By the Spirit 

That God 

May Come 

And His Holy Presence 

Have a place in your home 

Keep the fires burning 

Keep a log on the hearth 

Let the flame of Divine Love 

Forever 

In your soul 

Burn 

All impurities away 

When can I come and visit you again ?

# Buried treasure and the King

Are you still looking for buried treasure?

That illusive pot of gold

Hidden in the trunk 

Away in the attic 

Beneath the floorboards

Or deep in the earth 

High in the sky

Are you still looking for buried treasure?
 

Why Don’t you ask the King 

To share his riches? 

The King of Kindness

The King of Mercy

The King of Compassion

The King of Love

Would he not gladly share his riches

Feed the Poor

Prepare a place for you?

You who have been wandering homeless 

All you needed to do was ask 

And

as is said

Every good and perfect gift will be given

For the King 

Is always sharing

Always giving 

To his loyal subjects

So dear to his heart

Where are you going ?

(and)

How will you get there?

Would you like a lift ?
