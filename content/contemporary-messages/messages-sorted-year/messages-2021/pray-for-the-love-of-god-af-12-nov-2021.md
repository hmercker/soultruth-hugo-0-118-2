God bless you, precious souls; I am Matthew. There is great despair in your world. Many souls feel a sense of bereavement and loss because they do not feel a true connection with the flow of their lives and purpose for their lives. Instead, they find comfort in materialism and the pleasures of the flesh. Yet, this does not circumvent the terrible angst within the soul of so many upon your world. Among those who are lost and in this terrible condition, there are many who are coalescing into the Light of God and feeling a stronger connection and awareness of God. In them rises up a great joy, certainly, a sense of purpose and a sense of direction. 

So you posses two different realities in your world and these conditions, one of light and one of darkness. It is of various proportions and depth in accordance to the ways in which humanity chooses to overcome or circumvent their grief. Every soul is meant to be in alignment with God. It is not that God insists or forces this alignment, but God invites in every moment, every breath you take in the world, a beautiful connection of Light and Love. Whether the individual comes to this in a conscious and mental way, often it is their souls which know and are yearning and find this connection. Yet, it is a great comfort to many to know the truth, this simple truth that they are loved by God.

For the individual to come to recognize this and rejoice in this truth, then so much more can come to them in blessings, in God’s Hand and Touch upon their souls and their beings, opening up the many doors that will bring deep insight, great joy, and purpose in their lives. As God’s Love floods into them, so the awareness and the understanding of the direction of every soul created and born with a fleshy body, which then transforms into a spirit body in time, will come to see the reasons for this and the purpose of this awakening and flow of spiritual progress. 

You have each come to this reality, and many of you wish to share this truth with your brothers and sisters. Some are open and willing to hear you, others are not. But know, even with your presence, without words but with love, helps to awaken that individual to this truth. Some reject this outright and cannot reconcile their true selves with their mindful understandings of life, and they embark upon a road that is more difficult and less fulfilling. They have a tendency to categorize, dissect and intellectualize all that they experience. Their minds are powerful and active agents creating their material reality. Their souls languish because they are not recognized and the aspects and those perceptions and feelings that come with a soul that is active within the individual is lost and they feel alone and isolated in its own condition and sense of disconnection. 

As you continue to connect with God, so you strengthen the truth within you. So you strengthen the light and love that emanates around you and through you. In this way you affirm the truth and become a living example of it. I ask you, beloved souls, to continue to pray for this world, pray for your loved ones, pray for those whom you encounter in the world. This prayer, this desire for God to touch the many souls upon your world is a powerful catalyst to open many doors, possibilities and blessings for your brothers and sisters. 

Are you able to release those conditions within you which hold you back from this true relationship with your creator? Are you able to walk in the light without veering this way and that toward that which is not of light? Are you able to release your pain and those conditions within you that bring pain? The great blessing of God's Love strengthens you, awakens you and directs you so that you are able to move beyond this human condition, to release those things within you that hold you from God. 

When this is done in a way that there is light and there are openings and cracks and fissures within that shell that surrounds you, those encrustations that hold you back from God, you begin to sense the possibilities, the openings to greater freedom and release from pain. You come to know the joy of your own soul, the joy of God’s Touch upon it. You will find yourselves basking in the glories of God’s Love, His Touch upon each of you. 

May we come together in unity, in that clear understanding that we are here to be with our Creator, our Heavenly Father, to open ourselves to all that God has to give, to release all that holds us from God. In this way, we may rejoice together in this bond and experience that is God’s Blessings upon us. Be at peace, my beautiful friends. Know that you are truly loved and that we pray together for this great purpose of liberating the soul and awakening you to all the glories and wonderment that God provides for His children. 

God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you in His Love. We are here now in the Light of His Presence. Feel His Grace upon you, beloved souls. Know His Touch upon your soul, and feel the great joy that wells up from this beautiful blessing. God bless you. I am Matthew and my love is with you all. God bless you.
