…I am Seretta Kem. Many more Portals of Light are being opened in the world because of your efforts and prayers. As you continue to reach out to those you love in various communities and areas of your world, so the opportunity to establish a Portal of Light is made possible by the intentions of those who are connecting with your circles and your efforts and support in prayer towards those individuals. So, the work expands and the Light expands in your world through this simple and humble group of beautiful souls wishing to serve humanity, wishing to serve God. The power of these portals is great, it brings many more possibilities of blessings and Light and influence to these areas of the world which you all inhabit.  Indeed, there are those places that you are not so aware of and yet, there is a connection being made because of your work.

Do not forget that within your sleep states there is much happening and many connections and bonds being formed with those who are also in their sleep state.  Eventually, they will come to the conscious recognition of your work and be guided forward. And, there are many who are coming. If you multiply what you are doing now exponentially, you will come to know a great fruition of the work that you do in the world. Have great faith that you indeed are contributing to something wonderful and beautiful, that the Light is indeed expanding in your world and the Light is expanding in your souls. And I urge you to continue to pray for this gift of God’s Love.

Take time each day when you are alone, when you have a moment, when your thoughts are wandering, direct them to God and ask for this gift of Divine Love. In this way, the Light within your souls will expand, and the great potentials that come with your combined efforts in the world will multiply and flow in a powerful and direct way out into the world. So much can be accomplished by a few dedicated souls and indeed, there are more than a few in this group. I ask you to continue to dedicate yourselves to these efforts, to continue to pray for your brothers and sisters, for your loved ones and for all who are in need. For it is this intention, this desire, your prayers put forth as an active agent of your soul to God, who responds accordingly, in harmony with the Laws which He has put forward for the upliftment and journey of awakening towards Light for each individual soul.

You are beginning to harness the Laws which God has set forth and you will see in a clearer way what that may bring, those fruits of your labors, the fruits of your knowledge, the fruits that come with Love. These things are benefiting you now and will benefit you greatly in the future. May you consider your efforts as a dedication of love to your Creator and to all of humanity. For with this in mind, you reach many and many benefit.

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. My love is with you. There is an angel with each one of you and together we are working to expand this great network of Light and those Portals of Light that are being established in the world. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls. My love is with you.
