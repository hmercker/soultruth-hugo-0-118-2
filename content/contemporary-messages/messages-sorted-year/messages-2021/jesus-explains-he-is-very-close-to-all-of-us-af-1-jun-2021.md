I am with you all, beloveds. I come. I am Jesus. I come because I wish for you to know that I am close to each one of you. Even those who do not know me well, understand that I know you very well indeed and that I am close to each one of you. All those children upon Earth who come and pray to be with God, to receive His Love are my special brothers and sisters upon the Earth and know that I have a great love for you all and a sense of your struggles, your personalities, and your life. I know you and I know your souls for I walk as God’s agent of love as do all who belong within the Celestial Kingdom. I walk as a living example of the power of God’s Love within the individual. I come to you as your brother and friend and I am truly your friend. 

Do not think that I am too removed from the Earth and all who dwell within it so that I would not come to you for I do, beloveds, I do. I kneel in prayer with you. I come to uplift you. I come to bring blessings of healing and light to each of you and  your loved ones. I come as well because you have brought the possibility of my coming through your prayers into your life. You have opened that door and so I step through in joy, love and desire to minister to you all. So I come to be with you at these moments of prayer and other moments where you are in need and you set forth a prayer to God to ask for His blessings upon you. 

At times I feel called to you. At times I come to you to bring a blessing, upliftment, and healing so that love may flow freely around you for God and His angels are at your beck and call, beloveds, always. Know that we never leave you. We may indeed have times where we are called for other duties but know that an angel is always present for those of you who are sincere upon this path. For you are dear and precious children all. You are loved deeply and dearly by us in the Celestial Kingdom. Surely you know that you are loved by God beyond all measure and reckoning, that you are loved by your Creator.
So we bring love, the power of love to heal and bring greater harmony to you all. May you come to know that this great blessing and resource in your life is the highest and most powerful agent for light, change, healing, upliftment and peace. You are all deeply blessed. May you come to know this. May you put aside all that is in contradiction to this faith that you carry and this knowledge that you have that you are loved. We are with you, beloveds, always we are with you, never to leave, always to uplift, to protect, to guide, to teach, to embrace in love. 

May God bless you on this journey, beloved souls. My love is with you and there are many angels with us today as we continue to pray for your world and for all who dwell within it. We continue to pray for peace and harmony, that all that is meant to be in this world will come to be, that all that is within this world may come into greater harmony and light. So we pray together. So we are God’s agents, working for the benefit of humanity, working to bring forth greater light and harmony, working to teach others and demonstrate to others the power of love, the great Love of God’s Soul that can indeed transform your soul and all souls upon this Earth and within the worlds of spirit. 

These blessings come with your prayers, with your desires, with your efforts to reach to God and be within that great light, that blessed and Holy Touch that is the Holy Spirit upon you who are seeking for the inflowing of God’s Essence. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. God bless you.
