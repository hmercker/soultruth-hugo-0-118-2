# Entering a New Phase

September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

...I am Seretta Kem. Tomorrow in the dark room you will experience something different from what has been the case in the past few weeks. It will be a taste of what is to come in regards to the next level or phase of development. We will be able to accomplish this development without your physical presence in the coming weeks and months, provided you arrange for a particular day and time to come together. But this time within that room will be a catalyst for what we intend to do in your development phase.

It may feel somewhat strange, certainly different, but all is going according to plan and will awaken various gifts within you, capacities to see and know, healing will spring forth a gift of healing will spring forth for each of you. Deeper knowledge of truth will open within your consciousness and love will continue to grow and expand within your soul. The days of preparation for your true instrumentalities are not over, but continue on in their intensity and direction, and much will open to your conscious self, awarenesses, experiences. You will not lose this sense of camaraderie but this will too intensify together.

Think of one another through your day, send your love to your brothers and sisters, embrace them in your heart. And those who are outside of this group working towards the same ends, who are a part of God's plan, they too are your brothers and sisters in the world. Love all you meet. Accept the differences of thought and know that there is a commonality of soul that you share, this truth burning within you. Be patient with yourselves and with others. Be loving and true in your endeavours.

We continue on the journey, a journey as you have come to know, will never end, only milestones upon this road as your gifts open and reveal themselves. We continue as always in service, in truth, in love, serving our Creator, expressing love to humanity, helping to bring greater light to your world. It all flows in accordance to God's plan. So we shall walk this road together, and together we shall make great headway, great headway, as we are used to express Godâ€™s Will in the world.

May God bless you, my friends. May love be your expression always. I am your servant, your friend, your guide upon this journey. God bless you.
