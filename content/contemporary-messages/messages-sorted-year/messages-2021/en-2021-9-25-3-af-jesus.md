# Closing Message for Retreat

September 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Yes, I am with you, I am Jesus, shall continue to be with you upon your journeys of life, as you are my true brothers and sisters who carry the Truth as a light around you, carry God’s Love as a beacon within you, carry all that is meant to be embodied within you, beloved souls.

We thank you for your efforts, for you have made great progress. Progress that we have desired to make in the world for millennia, and you reach the threshold, beloved souls, beyond which is a whole new world awaiting you.

God’s gracious blessings will bring to you untold riches of the soul, untold light. May peace be with you beloveds. Know that we are ever grateful for what you do, and we see what you will do and this gives us greater joy. God bless you. I am with you always. God bless you.
