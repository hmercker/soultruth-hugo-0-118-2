# The Greatest Impediment to Light in Your World is Ignorance and Apathy

July 11<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Aaron received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my beloved brothers and sisters. I am Aaron and I come to acknowledge my beautiful charge, sister in light, who continues to grow and strive for greater light and love. I acknowledge you, dearly beloved, and I'm with you often as you continue on this journey of light and truth.

My beloved brothers and sisters, the greatest impediment to light in your world is ignorance and apathy. These two aspects of the human condition seem to come together, allowing much of the conditions of your world that are not of light to proliferate. And it is for each of you to battle those conditions within yourself that would bring apathy and ignorance to yourselves. For it is in the active soul, the soul who is willing to push beyond the condition of darkness that is so prevalent in your world and be liberated in light and love, the great love of God that pierces the soul and insists upon the mind that it cannot wallow within the dark conditions which are so common in your world.

As you continue to pray for the Father's Love, you cannot rest in this condition that is of darkness, for within the blessing of the Father's Love comes a great challenge, a great sword that pierces the soul and the consciousness of the individual so that they come to realize what is in harmony and in alignment with God. In this, one must act, one must choose, one must be strong and faithful and desire to be in the light of truth. You are each striving for truth and for light and you have found that the way towards this is love. And I say to you, recognize what love truly is, recognize the power of love, recognize that great and unique blessing that is God's Love upon your soul. In this way you will be liberated from those conditions of darkness. There will be no apathy. You will be activated in love and ignorance will fall away, for you cannot live in a state of somnambulance when one is awakened in love. Your being is charged with love, your mind comes to experience true love, the love of God and the love for yourself and for your brothers and sisters.

How can you walk in a world without this expression, touching every aspect of your life, releasing all judgments and pain and ignorance and all of those things that make human life so difficult. You will know liberation, beloved souls, each and every one of you will know the liberation of the touch of God upon your soul and will find yourself in the joy, an awakening and knowing and feeling and understanding that comes with the soul that has truly been touched by God. You will be His children truly in alignment, truly in this love, bathed each and every day by this blessed touch upon you that God is so eager to give. God has such a deep desire to benefit each and every soul with the touch of His Love so that they may awaken and slough off those conditions that keep it from truly being with their beloved Creator. You are each charged with truth and know the truth. I urge you to live this truth with every moment, in every breath. I charge you with the responsibility to be the example of love and light in the world, for each of you are capable of this action.

Each of you are in alignment with God to some degree and this alignment will only become firm and sure within you and between you and your creator. There will be a deep understanding, a deep connection, a deep flow of love that will only intensify as you grow and become stronger. As you become spiritually mature, you will be the instrument of God's desire and Will to bring greater love and light to the world. You are His children, beloveds, and you have come to recognize and acknowledge the wonderment that is life, life given and blessed by God and greater life given to your soul from God's great Soul. May His Holy Spirit continue to awaken your soul, beloved, beloved children, may you come to see with the eyes of your soul, know with the understanding of your soul, act with the wisdom of your soul, that love may proliferate in your being, your consciousness, your life and in your world. This must come to be, beloved souls, for you are truly, truly touched by God and will come to know God as your beloved Father, as One who is close at all times and will give to you with the guidance, the blessing, the instruction that you require to be His instruments of love upon the earth.

Beloved souls, I come to encourage you, to charge you with this endeavor, to be lights in the world, to disperse the darkness wherever you go and to teach your brothers and sisters what being truly alive is, and can be, in this world. May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Aaron and I come to bless you and to guide you, uplift you and encourage you upon the road of light, of truth and love. God Bless you, beloved souls. God bless you in the light of God's Touch. God bless you always.
