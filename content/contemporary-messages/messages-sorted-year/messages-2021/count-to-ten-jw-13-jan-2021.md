I am here your brother Francis. I come in the Love of God and in the peace that passes all understanding. Allow your hearts and your minds and your bodies to be at peace. Allow the Love of God to illuminate your soul to dispel the darkness and the troubling clouds, so that you may be a ray of sunshine. When confronted with negativity speak love; speak love. Be at peace. Do not allow your hearts to be troubled for we are with you and protect you. 

Whenever you are disturbed take a moment to count to ten if you must and go to God: *“Dear God, bring me peace, open my soul to Your love, calm my heart, alleviate my fear, my doubt. Let me truly turn the other cheek with my soul when confronted.”* 

How difficult this can be in human nature and yet it is a simple gesture when you are in God’s Love, when you are in Grace, when you feel the glow and this peace that does indeed pass understanding, human understanding, because it is a gift from God. I stress this to all those here and beyond in this time and these trials. Be peace, be love, be prayer, be still. Allow your light to shine upon and dispel the darkness. This is the gift you have been given and it is real. It is a gift from God from Whom all blessings flow. It is a good and perfect gift, and it is yours to share. 

Know in the depths of your soul that you are truly loved beyond this world but also in this world. Walk in love. I am with you. May God bless you with a great abundance of His Divine love now and always. I am your brother and friend in Christ. I am Francis. Go with God.
