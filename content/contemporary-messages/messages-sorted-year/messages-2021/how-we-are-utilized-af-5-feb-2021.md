Received by Al Fike


Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. Today we have gathered you together to create a light that will benefit the world and benefit yourselves. In this gathering above the Earth plane, we have drawn you into a condition, a space, a place where you may all come together and become a sort of chain of light that has been arranged by us, so that there is a great flow of light and blessings through you to the world. 

In this gathering of beautiful lights of which you are, you have served God to bring blessings and light not only to those close to you but to the World, helping to alleviate much suffering, bringing harmony to your Earthly plane and allowing the angels to work in a harmonious way with you and through you for the benefit of many. The benefit that you have received my beloved friends is that you have been purified to some degree within your physical body and your spirit body. You have once again felt the upliftment of the blessings that you have prayed for and those responses that have come with your prayers. 

Yes we may utilize each of you in many ways provided you are willing, open and desire to be a channel of light in the World. There are many complicated situations in your World, situations that bring disharmony and suffering to many. So we must utilize you in ways that may bring alleviation and harmony in those complex conditions. 

We thank you all for being a part of this effort and we would encourage you to continue to be prayerful, to be in greater light, to expand your soul in God’s Love and Light so that you may be more powerful channels and instruments  that will flow out into the world through your prayerful efforts together.
May God bless you, my beautiful friends. May you carry this light that has been generated with you as you engage in your daily life and be aware that God may use you at any time and in any circumstance to be a channel of light in the world, an instrument of healing, of peace, upliftment, to neutralize the negative conditions, the thought conditions that are so powerful in your Earthly plane. 

Yes there is much that can be done and certainly much that must be done to help brighten your World. Your efforts, your time, your dedications are greatly needed and greatly appreciated. Indeed, God blesses those who are willing to be servants of blessings for others. So I say to you, continue to reach up for the highest of all conditions, to be a light in the World and to allow God to use you as his instruments to enlighten the world. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem and may the great Essence of God’s Soul infill you soul with ever greater love, awakening all that is within you. God bless you, my love is with you. God bless you.
