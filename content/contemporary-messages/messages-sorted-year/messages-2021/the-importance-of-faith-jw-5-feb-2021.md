# The Importance of Faith 

February 5<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


I am here Clare. How important it is to have faith. I spoke about courage and today you mentioned having a leap of faith. When you take that leap, which is a courageous thing, and you walk in faith, and you open to the Love of God, all things fall into place in God’s time and in the flow of harmony in His universe, on earth, and in the heavens. When you align yourself in faith in love all things become possible. 

This freedom that you so wish to have is yours. Make use of it. The deeper your prayer, the more time you allow and make for it, the more the wonder of its blessings in the response from the Creator will astonish you. Just as you are somewhat amazed that you have picked messages to read that seem to be in harmony with each other, you will evermore be amazed to be walking in the flow of God’s grace and love, seeing things not though dark glasses but through the prism in the clarity of God’s love. May this gift be yours. 

I am your sister in the Love of God and in Christ. My dear kind mice I wish you every blessing. Go in peace, go in grace, go in the love of God my dear ones. I am Clare of Assisi. God bless you.
