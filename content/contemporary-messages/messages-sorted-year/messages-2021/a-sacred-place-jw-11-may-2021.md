# A Sacred Place

May 11<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



It is I Clare. I come into this circle of light, and I do not wish to disturb this peace but only to remind you to keep this place a sanctuary. A place not only of learning the truths but a sacred place where you can give everything to God without fear of reprisal or judgement.

All are lifted up that wish to be ascending on the ladder of love. This circle of light is a jewel in the crown of prayer. For as the longings of your souls reach out like so many arms raised to the heavens, allow your hearts to open. Allow your souls to receive. As the saying goes “seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all things will be given.” Though you may have busy lives with many interests and all kind of material things that must be dealt with, when you come into prayer, when you come together, I ask you to remember those words. 

May the Love of God be with you on this journey as we walk together. I am with you as are many and I love you. I am your sister and friend and guide in the Celestial heavens, a transformed soul in Christ. I am Clare of Assisi.
