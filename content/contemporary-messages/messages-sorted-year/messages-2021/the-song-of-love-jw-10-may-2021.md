I am your friend and I come in the love of God, I am Yogananda. As you come into this circle of light, each one being reborn in spirit, each soul lifted in God’s Love, coming here with your deep desire to be at one with your Creator. To be lifted above this world if even for a moment in the love that has no boundaries that knows no bounds that permeates the entire universe. God is the Master musician and each part of creation is vibrating<sup>1</sup> in song. 

The vibrations of love create harmonies, dispelling the darkness, and opening the heart. As the soul awakens and begins to see the effects of sleep, and here I am referring to spiritual sleep, the endless distractions and unrestrained desire for material wealth, for self- gratification, and even worse, for revenge it begins to see that these things which are of the lowest vibrations, need love, they need your light, they need your song, they need your smile, they need your touch, they need your helping hand. When you reach out in God’s love it is like a beam of light in a dark room. 

The gentle rain of the love of God is coming into this circle, falling upon the earth, nourishing your souls, that you may all blossom like the sweetest flower. I encourage you to be aware of your amusements and to choose wisely those that are uplifting, bring joy, peace. Is this not why you are here in this moment in the radiance of this circle?  I tell you, that you have drawn many here. We all come in the love of God and with our love for you and humanity. Choose wisely, go in peace. May God bless each one. I am Yogananda.
