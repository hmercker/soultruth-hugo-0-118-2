# Encouragement to Tell Friends and Family about God's Love

August 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

...Augustine. I hear your prayers for your families, your loved ones, those who are close in your life, and as we have said many times, the light that you carry has its influence upon those around you. It is like a lit passageway where many of your family and friends pass by and they notice that indeed there is some light. But often that light is taken for granted or is forgotten quickly, so the effect and influence that you have upon them is short-lived and they continue to go back to their somewhat unlit lives, which is the case for many. It is important that you speak the words of truth to your loved ones, not to preach and cajole and insist upon certain ideals and behaviors that they must follow. Rather, a simple statement such as: “My beautiful brother, my beautiful sister, my beautiful friend, God loves you and you can receive this Love within your soul, provided you are willing to pray and ask for it.” Who could be offended by this? Yes, then the choice is upon that individual whether they will take your advice or not, and indeed as you pass by, this simple phrase given once, maybe twice to your friends and loved ones, is sufficient to implant within their soul and their mind, the truth.

There are times when those close to you ask you about your life and your interests and the things that you are embarking upon, and indeed this opens the door for you to tell them openly and honestly. Some of you are concerned that you will be rejected, that your friends will turn away, that they will project certain ideas upon you and assumptions regarding your spiritual life, but underneath these judgments is a great deal of fear, and underneath the fear is a soul desire to have what you have, to be close to these blessings that you receive. But the mind continues to put up its roadblocks, those things that hold the individual back from acknowledging God, acknowledging God's Love for them, acknowledging their true heartfelt desire for this blessing. So it is good to occasionally remind those whom I speak of to remember that God loves them, to remember that God's Love is a gift freely given to them if they do so desire and if they are open to receiving it.

Yes, you walk as an example but when you keep your mouth closed, your communication guarded, your truth hidden, you may indeed have a light that shines, but it is often passed by because you have not gained the attention the focus from those around you. Take some time to speak gently of God's Love, not in a way that preaches and insists, but in a way that tells your friends and loved ones the joy that you feel because you have discovered God's Love and the power of this Love to uplift, to heal, to bring one to God in all of God's Glory and Light.

It is simple and it is a gift that you may give to others. A gift that may not be well received at times, but a gift nonetheless that is launched within the mind and the soul and will in time, bring its fruits, its blessings, its light to that individual. Yes, be a light, beloved and beautiful souls, be a light that gives with all humility and grace, the truth, so that you may share this amongst those you love and you may speak of this to those who you know could benefit from this gift.

Many blessings come in many different ways, and at times, even when you do not speak, there is a touch upon the soul. But you must help to release the roadblocks that are within the mind towards that soul understanding. God gives you the opportunities and if you are unsure of what to say, ask God to put the words within your mouth, to speak them clearly and simply. With a loving demeanor, who can fault you or turn away? They may not accept your words, but indeed within their souls there is great joy of recognition and desire.

May God bless you as you continue to uphold and support your loved ones, your families, and those around you. For this is how God works, this is God's Light shining through His instruments, His channels of Love. May you blessed as you continue to be those channels of Love for God. You are beautiful in your souls. You continue to merge and integrate these truths within your whole self, a blessing a truth and a light that manifests through you as the power of God's Love continues to work its blessings upon you. God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you in His Light.

I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to pray with you, I come because I love you, I come because I am just one more of the angels of heaven who look upon you with great love and desire to minister and uphold you. God bless you. God bless you beloved ones. My love is with you. God bless you.
