# Jesus ushers in a new era

September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

...I am Jesus. I come because you, together with your angel friends and all concerned, have created a great light in your world, and with this great light will come a river of opportunities and possibilities that are opened to you because you have drawn a great blessing to each of you; a blessing that will endure, a blessing that is permanent within you. What comes with this blessing are the open doors of many opportunities and gifts, unfolding of God's intentions through you.

Every soul in the world has hidden within them many possibilities and gifts, but few come to open this door and allow what God wishes to express and manifest through you into the world. You have willingly allowed yourself to be aligned with God's Will, to be aligned with all that which is within you that may reflect God's Will, provided you choose for the highest and allow the highest to manifest through you.

Let yourselves be carried by this flow, this great onrush of light that will bring about many events, much that is intended that is in harmony with God's plan and desire for the upliftment, healing and salvation of humanity. Through your efforts and prayers you are now deeply committed to this and will find your way and your expression as God's true instruments in the world. Feel the joy within your souls, beloved, beloved lights in the world, and know that God's Hand rests firmly upon you, and in this you will know His Will.  You will be a part of His plan and much will be expressed through you.

You have been called and you have answered.  You have responded with love. You have opened yourselves as wide as you can to allow God in, allow the Grace of His Touch to touch your soul deeply. All of these things that have come to you in these precious moments together and all that you have built through your prayers over many years, is now coming to fruition, will now manifest in powerful ways. You will see what you might call little miracles in each day. You will be God's instruments in deep and profound ways. You will come to know your true purpose on this world.

Your efforts, your accomplishments, your light , your beautiful souls, give us all great joy. To see in the world such dedication and profound desire to do God's Will and work, gives us great hope for the future, brings to us a resounding joy that comes from God's beating Heart of Love resounding through the Celestial Heavens. In this we know that Light is coming to the world, that there will in time be an end to all the unnecessary suffering, all the turmoil and error and darkness. It is coming to an end, beloved souls, and it is because those of you on Earth  and we in heaven and the bright spirits of the spirit world and the brothers and sisters of other worlds, have come together in prayer in a concerted effort to awaken humanity through God's Touch upon them.

We are all a part of the unfolding of a wondrous era, a beautiful time in the history of humanity where much will be discarded and much will be gained in love and light and truth. You are the forerunners of this effort upon the earthly plane and you will have all that you require to do the work that is needed, for as I say, God's Hand is firmly upon you. In this way, all that obstructs, all that is of doubt or care or resistance will be washed away with love, and you will find yourself in great freedom and joy, rejoicing with us all that the time for great healing in your world has begun.

Rejoice with us, beloved souls, let the joy in your heart spill over into this world. We rejoice with you. Many, many souls rejoice with you as the new era is ushered in and the old is swept away. Love will be the currency of this world of yours in due time, and truth will come to the hearts of humanity. They will come to understand, much sooner than you might realise, what is important, what can be amongst humanity, what is in true alignment with God and His Laws of Love. And you will speak these truths, share them with many and walk in such light that your words will be heard and acknowledged and absorbed by the souls of many.

May God bless us all upon this journey, this awakening that must come to humanity. For, do I not see amongst you, souls awakening from their slumber, truth burning in their hearts and wisdom being expressed in all that you do? You are truly God's children, His servants of love, and we join you, beloved souls, upon this great path of service. We are with you and we are all with God in His Glory and Light and Love. May God bless you, beloved souls, keep you in His Light. Beloveds, beloveds, I am with you. God bless you.
