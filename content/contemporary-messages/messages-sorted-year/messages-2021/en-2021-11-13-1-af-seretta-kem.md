Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. You continue to elicit the blessings of God and the blessings and help from your angel friends and what you call your stellar friends. Much support and upliftment are given to each of you as you continue to grow and awaken in a world that is contrary to this path and trajectory toward the soul’s fulfillment and love.

Indeed, much is expected of you, my beloved and beautiful friends. Our hope is with you and those like you in the world who are able to step beyond the conditions and mindful concerns of earthly life and reach forward to that highest of blessing of God’s Love, that you may live your life in the light of truth, in the peace of God’s Touch upon you, in the joy of God’s Love within you. In this path of awakening the soul, so your perceptions will deepen, your understandings will widen, your knowledge will be more profound and yet simplified in many ways.

This is not the journey of the mind, beloveds, but the journey of the soul and the awakening of the soul mind which can bring to you much insight and perception of truth. May you continue to consider that it is the awareness of the soul that will bring the truth that you seek, the understanding that is needed, the power to step forward which is required for if you do not step in the light and truth of love, then you are at arm’s length from God. This is the human condition and the great challenge that you face, to embrace God fully within your hearts and souls, to walk more resolutely upon the Path Divine, to seek fervently your relationship with God which comes with His blessing of Love.

This has been the challenge and always will be the challenge for you and for humanity to reconnect with their Creator, to truly discover the power of love, and how that may indeed change the world. The truth of love is simple. It is direct. It is without those mindful complications that you upon the earthly plane tend to attribute to this journey. Those of you, when you are attuned to your soul, understand this and see the difference between the expectations of your mind and the knowings of your soul.

Part of your challenge is when you apply this soulful knowledge to your mindful condition and earthly expectations, it is a back-and-forth struggle between the two. Indeed, often your emotions, your judgments, your thoughts and expectations get in the way of that pure relationship with soul and your soul’s pure relationship with God. Allow yourselves to sink deeply within your soul putting aside those earthly concerns, being in the Grace and Love of God. In this way, all that you seek to know, desire, to understand will be given, given powerfully, clearly, joyfully to you.

We are here to uplift you, my beloved brothers and sisters. We are here joined with you in a great venture to bring the Truth of God’s Love to humanity in such ways and means and avenues that it can be understood and recognized by all upon your world. This does not require great mindful extrapolations and explanations. It requires faith, commitment, and dedication to prayer and the awakening of your soul.

Know you continue to aspire to mindful clarity and understanding and wish to apply this to your efforts thinking this is the way and means of communicating and connecting with many for it makes sense that in your world there is a great mindful condition, the condition of thought which insists upon truth that is understood through the mind and the brain. You see that without logical expressions and efforts on your part as God’s instruments that these things will not reach their mark, that this truth will fall flat and unrecognized by many. Indeed, on this level of understanding and communication, you are correct, that without mindful and intellectual contribution, you cannot be considered by others as being a valid channel of truth for truth is understood by the vast majority of humanity as that of the mind and the inclinations of the mind.

Yet, if you overcomplicate the matter when communicating these truths, then you open the door to much interpretation and extrapolation that comes with this condition. It is best to keep the truth simple and clear. It is best to communicate with great integrity and honesty and to have faith that God will do the rest, beloveds. God will instill within the soul of the individual a desire to know the truth and to know God.

As you continue to beat against those doors of resistance from your brothers and sisters, your efforts are not wasted as you continue to repeat the simple truth of God’s Love. You are within the flow and alignment of God’s Will and His plan. It does not require complex and convoluted efforts to arrive at truth. Truth is easily derived from the soul, a soul that is awakened, a soul that knows, a soul that realizes truth when it encounters truth.

Yet, the great contradiction of this is the very fact that I must use words and use intellectual concepts and paradigms in order to communicate with you all through this instrument. Yet indeed, it is important that you live a life that is in alignment with God and in alignment with your own soul, constantly growing with the inflowing of the Divine Essence. As this transformation takes place, so the knowings and the communications and the way in which you perceive and experience life will change and will be transformed as the mind of the soul and your material mind merge into the great vessel of knowledge, of capacity to communicate with love and clarity and truth.

These things come subtly. It is a day-by-day process. Each of you are being challenged day-by-day as you encounter the conditions of your world, as you encounter the conditions within you, as you try to reconcile this truth with your life. I urge you to walk in faith and to understand that these transformative qualities, aspects of yourself that are being touched by the Love of God, your soul awakened, does not come in an instant and cannot be realized with great analysis and dissection of the mind but comes with the power of faith that is the reflection of the soul in alignment with God. In this way, you may walk in the world with humility and grace and a power that is not common in your world, the power of God’s Love flowing through an individual to many.

It is the truth expressed and the truth lived by the power of love. May you all come to know this power. May you all come to see within you where the true source of light and knowledge and understanding comes and that you may honour this source, that you may truly love that part of you that is your soul and acknowledge that it is your true self. In this way, you circumvent the many pitfalls and barriers that your mind may erect as you continue to awaken and truly become yourself.

May God bless you deeply, my beloved friends. May God guide you along this path of light and truth. May be freed from the constrictions of your mind and awakened to the possibilities and expansiveness of your soul.

I am your brother and friend, Seretta Kem, and I come to you to uplift and inspire. I am your true brother and I am with you all as you continue to progress upon this path and seek to serve God as part of His plan for the salvation of humanity. We join together in unity, beloved souls, and shall strengthen these bonds with each day that passes, each moment in prayer, each thought and desire to serve God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. My love is with you.
