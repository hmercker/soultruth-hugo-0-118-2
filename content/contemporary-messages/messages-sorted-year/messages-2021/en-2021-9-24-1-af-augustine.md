# Congratulations on creating a beacon of light

September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

May God's Love continue to awaken your soul and bring you to that place of clarity, of deep spiritual vision, understanding, that through you may come great waves of love as God continues to use you as His instruments in the world.

You are pioneers, beloved souls. We have come together and journeyed together to places that until now, have not been realized or come into being: collaboration between material mortals, Celestial spirits, those from other worlds, and bright spirits in our world. This has involved a great many souls in collaboration and has come about because of planning and consideration amongst all of these many groups and collections of souls who are very focused upon bringing light to your world.

All this is made possible because God blesses each and every one of these souls, all of us together, so that we may be in that harmony of light and love, so that we may all work together to be a channel for God's Will and expression in this world and in the universe. For, the light that has been created and opened through our collective efforts has reached deep into the universe and has been noticed by many who have the vision and spiritual progression to recognize this light.

So in this regard, you have made history, my friends; you have opened a door never before opened. This comes as each of you, in your own ways, your own gifts, your own unique souls, have come together to create such a beautiful mix of light and intention and love, bringing great harmony amongst you. So we are able to stretch what you call the boundaries of our abilities and capacities to interconnect and communicate together, to bring blessings here-to-fore unseen upon your world, to bring our friends who have come a great distance in the galaxy to assist us all in this endeavour.

How blessed we all are to have come together in this way. You, in your efforts, will ensure future endeavours and collaborations that will indeed bring greater light to the world. The light of God's Love, the light of His blessings, the light of all that is good and brings life, is throughout the universe. The universe is impregnated with this light, with God’s Love, with all of these things, infused in every creation, everything that is, not only in this universe but in all the layers and dimensions of God's creative forces and expressions.

You are coming to learn about these layers, these different dimensions. You are coming to see them expressed within yourselves. You are coming to understand what life truly is, which is an unlimited expression of God's creative forces, to the minutest detail and element, to the great expanse of the material universe and beyond. This truth will be taught as times change and your brothers and sisters are willing to open their minds and their hearts and their souls to all that is in God’s Creation and all that is that God wishes to give to His beloved children of Earth and the spirit world. You are the forerunners, beloved souls,  who have opened doors that will bring greater understanding to humanity and to the souls of those spirits who cluster around the earthly planes. In this way, you will ensure that greater light will come to your world and to the worlds of spirit.

As God's humble instruments, you will bring blessings and knowledge of such power and wonderment that it will change the world. This is accomplished through the power of love beating within your heart and souls, a gift from God, a blessing from God to each of you and all who are a part of this great venture. For, those who are involved extend beyond this Circle of Light to other circles and individuals who are truly part of this venture and time of prayer and efforts.

There is much more to come, beloved souls, there is much more work to do. As you have seen and recognized through your life that the spiritual journey does not end, and the spiritual work that comes as a result of your individual lights and development, soul awakening, will increase and expand and encompass much that will assist humanity to evolve beyond this rudimentary stage and come to recognize the full capacities of each individual, what is possible, what will be within the life of the individual upon this world.

Yes, you forge the path. Together, we provide the impetus as channels of God's Will, His Love flowing into everything that we do together. You will find yourselves opening up to guidance and collaborations that will surprise you. You will see the fulfilment of your soul’s purpose expressed in such wondrous and surprising ways that indeed, the gratitude that you feel towards God and all that has come about to this time and place, will be small and diminished compared to the overwhelming sense of love and gratitude towards your Heavenly Father as you witness and are a part of the magnificent undertakings that are to be expressed in this world of yours. As God's plan unfolds, as you grow, as love infills you more fully, as you experience more of the grandeur and wonderment of God and the possibilities of your own beautiful selves, so many doors will be opened and much light will flood through.

My beloved friends, we are so very joyful of what we have accomplished together and what can come from these accomplishments. You will find yourself upon a golden road lit by love. Every football will bring joy to your heart, wonderment to your mind and love to your soul, and this will be expressed and manifest in beautiful ways upon this journey. You are truly blessed, my beloved students, you are truly blessed, and we rejoice in your accomplishments. Yet in many ways, this is just the beginning. So much more to come. And we require your further dedication and focus upon these things, for the time grows short, the labourers are few, and much needs to unfold if God’s plan is truly to take hold in your world.

You are needed always, beloved souls. This time together is merely a taste of what is to come in your collaborations. The bond that you have created together in this loving time of prayer and development of many gifts will continue to unfold in ways that will not only bring you together in the flesh, but in ways that will utilize your gifts and blessings in future times and collaborations, to bring greater light to the world.

You have prepared yourselves. You have come together with deep desire, and have complied with the requests and the efforts made from our side of life. You have done what we have required, you have done so willingly and with love. Yet, there is much more to come, beloved souls. I'm sure that each of you feel this and know this within your heart, that you merely step upon the threshold and will continue to walk forward, guided and protected by God, awakened ever so slowly, ever so beautifully, within your souls.

There will come a time when your beloved Jesus will manifest through each of you. There will come a time when his presence amongst humanity will be seen and recognized, though not of the flesh and yet not purely of the spirit. Of this expression of what is called photoplasmic manifestation has been developed amongst you, but indeed it takes time for maturity and for the appropriate circumstances for you to see and experience this gift. Though I know that many of you are eager to experience this manifestation, and we will continue to strive with you as you meet together from your homes in prayer, development will continue to take place and we will hone those gifts within you and the collaborations between you and us and others, so that when the time is ripe and God’s Will be done, this gift will indeed come through and touch the world.

You have certainly not wasted your time, beloved souls. Indeed, every moment you have spent together, every prayer that you have made, every effort to be in harmony with God’s Will and with the needs of we in spirit, have brought much in the way of blessings to you and to the world. A great light has been established, a light that together we will sustain, a light that will influence the world in many ways and in many layers and dimensions. This light has never been seen before upon this world, and it is great, wondrous to behold, and it is the beacon in the galaxy indicating that indeed, the birth of a new world begins. A world that is emerging and growing, transforming, a world that will truly come about because God wills it. A world that you will all see in time and participate within. The time comes, beloved souls, for great change, for great light, for the wonderment of God’s Creation manifest in light, harmony and love.

Beloved children, you are truly loved. You are appreciated by many, many spirits and angels. You are known by many and you shall be known by many on Earth. This comes in good time. Blessed be those who seek truth. Blessed be those who are wedded to God in love. Blessed be those who serve in light, and blessed are you, beloved souls. May God bless you. We are all with you in love and shall be evermore. God bless you, I am Augustine.

My love for you is great. God bless you.
