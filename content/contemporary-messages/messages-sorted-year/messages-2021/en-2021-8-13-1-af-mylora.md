# A Garden within You

August 13<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

May God's Love awaken your souls, my beautiful friends. I am Mylora and I come to bring my healing touch along with God's healing Touch to help uplift you all, to bring peace amongst you, to bring a joy that is a soul feeling close to God, a joy of all the beauty that is within you yearning, yearning for its expression, releasing all of the light into the world. Beloveds, beloved souls, you are lights. May that light burst forth into the world as a channel of God's Love, as an expression of the beautiful souls that God has created, each unique, each residing within you--that beautiful, beautiful soul filled with so many potentials, possibilities and gifts to be awakened.

There is a whole garden within you, a garden that God has created, a garden that is waiting to be alive and expressed in the world where many can come and appreciate how beautiful you truly are. How wondrous is this garden unique to you, beloved souls. How glorious is love expressed and flowing through you as God's instruments. Your gifts of healing and comfort, of love, of wisdom, of joy expressed with each unique flower of this garden bursting forth, bursting forth in the beautiful grace of God, the wonderful joy of life. May you be truly blessed today, beloved souls, truly blessed upon this journey of greater love, greater light, greater beauty, greater joy. It all comes to pass as you continue to pray and come together with God for His blessings upon your soul.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Mylora. My love is with you and healing touch upon each one of you. God bless you, God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you.
