# Prays With Us for Greater Balance and Harmony

I am White Cloud. I come to pray with you for this planet in which you live. I come to be with you in your efforts to help correct those things, those wrongs that have been done to your world and to one another. I am only one in many hundreds, in many thousands of angels and spirits that are with you in these efforts. For without these efforts made, will your world be healed? No, it will not be healed, unless all of the peoples of the earth change their view, their ideas, their perceptions of what the world truly is, the home and the womb for all those souls who come and incarnate and live within it. A great gift from God, a great gift indeed. But like all of Godâ€™s creations it is part of a life, a wholeness, that is truly set in motion with the intention of creating greater harmony and balance and beauty. And so it is for you to be a part of that harmony, to go with the motion of the earth, that flow of energy that is the earth. To be with it in love and appreciation in action and in thought, in all things that are your expression of your physical, spiritual, soulful self. 

Alignment is necessary for you to be in harmony with earth.  An alignment with God ensures that you are in harmony with earth. For when you are with God and connected deeply with God, then you cannot help but be sensitive and aware and in love with your earthly life. Do not take anything for granted my friends, for each gift that God gives you is to be revered, acknowledged, and loved so that you may carry on upon your path and be within the light, unified and harmonized with all that God has created. 

When I walked the earth, we were in harmony with the earth and it is time once again for humanity to see that they must change and that their attitudes and actions must reflect a deep acknowledgment and love for the earth. You cannot continue to desecrate this place without deep and difficult consequences that will make your life more difficult, more challenging. Tread softly, and tread with the desire to be a light, to be in harmony with all, to be aware of all, so that you might be an example of truly a child of God, truly a child of the Great White Spirit. 

You are all given so much and at times you take so much. It is time to have balance, for that pendulum to come to that center point where all is in equality and balance and harmony. May you continue to seek God, to open yourself to God. To receive this great gift from God which is His Essence, so that you may have the wisdom and the perception to change, to be in greater harmony with all. And we will help you, so many eagerly await the opportunity to uplift, to help, to teach, to inspire. It is for you to desire this, to realize how you need this and how you want this within yourself. Harmony does not come easily. Harmony is worked for, desired, expressed with deep change and release of those things that are not in harmony with God. It takes your effort, my friends. It takes your effort, your discipline, your desire, and your love. 
            
Be with God and the light and harmony of His creation. Be with God within your soul, acknowledging the wonderment that is His Creation. You will find your way beyond the shadows and darkness, which is what you have all created upon this earth. Find your way to the sunlight, the warmth, the love that is God shining upon you bringing His wisdom and strength, insights, peace, it awaits you, it awaits all of you, all of humanity. May you awaken to this my friends, awaken deeply to open, to be with God and all of you and all ways are you to be with God.
 
May God bless you on this journey. That you continue to follow the river of His Love and be thankful, and joyful. Your eyes may shine with all that God has given you and will give. His blessings. His blessings, never ending that will bring harmony to you and to the world. 
Thank you for listening to me my friends. I am White Cloud, I am happy to be with you today as you acknowledge your Mother Earth and acknowledge the Creator of all and acknowledge one another in love and tribute, in life and joy. Thank you. Blessings to you. Blessings to all.
