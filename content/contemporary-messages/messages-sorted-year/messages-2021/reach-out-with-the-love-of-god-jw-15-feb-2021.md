I am here your true brother and friend, I am Francis. How I love to see my brothers in prayer. How I love to hear the sweet music of praise of the Creator and the poetry that lifts up the soul. My brothers as you spend more time in prayer and in the awareness of God in the flow of His grace, in the presence of His love, you see the condition of the world and your hearts are moved. Your arms opened wide to embrace every lost soul, every person who is hungry, who is homeless, who has been forgotten. 

When a soul is in turmoil, when as soul is in poverty you can act with human kindness, to feed them, to clothe them, to provide them company and you can act in the company of angels and give them the food, the nourishment of Godâ€™s love, the prayer to receive it, to feed each hungry soul, to bring a light to the darkness of this world. There is always much work to be done and I commend you for reaching out in compassion and with empathy, and most of all with the love of God in your hearts and the light of His love in your souls. 

You have been told that the rewards will be great. I wish to tell you that that is an understatement, for the more you move into the grace of God, the more you are lifted above this world, the more you begin to feel that your boat is crossing the ocean, sometimes calm, sometime turbulent, to land on the shores of bliss in the Celestial heavens where the presence of God reigns supreme. Go in peace keep the flame of love alive. God loves you. We love you. God bless you. I am Francis of Assisi.
