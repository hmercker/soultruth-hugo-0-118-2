James Reid received by Al Fike

I am James Reid. I've come because I wish to share with you a great triumph in my spiritual life in the world of spirit, and that is that I'm about to enter into the Celestial Kingdom. I presently reside in the seventh sphere and have worked my way to the very top of that many layered sphere of life and will embark to the Celestial Kingdom very soon now.

I wish to thank all of you for your efforts in prayer for the world. This is a crucial time, as you well know, and a time where prayer is greatly needed. I wish to thank you for your prayers on behalf of my soul and my journey towards God. If I knew back when I was on Earth what I know now, how different my perspective would be. I would most certainly rewrite every book that I had written and considered every word that I had spoken. It is not that what I said and what I shared and what I wrote was of error, but it was incomplete, very incomplete. Where I used a great tangle of words to explain the simple concept, now I would cut to the chase, as you would say. I would simplify my perceptions and ideas because when one comes to the truth and all its wonderment and beauty, essentially what one may express about the truth is simple and elegant.

I wish to encourage you both to be clear in your thoughts, your expressions of truth. Do not over complicate, and do not worry about what others might think or say about your words and your perceptions. Rather, be free in your soul and know your soul is a great gift from God, that pearl of wisdom that exists within each of you. Express that wisdom, my friends, express it with love. Allow the great inspirations of God to wash over you, wash through you, to bless your friends, brothers and sisters, all that you encounter upon this world of yours.

I've been observing your efforts, and I participate in your prayers and your, what you call direct voice prayers, and my dedication towards your work strengthens as I grow in the Father's Love because I see that you have come closer to the truth than I ever did, and your work towards bringing the truth to the world, is more powerful than what I ever accomplished. It is your dedication to the Divine Love Truth and to prayer to receive greater quantities of God's Love that has brought you thus far, my friends.

I want you to know that you have many, many friends on my side of life who are supporting you, praying for you, helping to guide you and influence you, in the directions that are in great harmony with God's Will.

Take your time to consider your moves, your efforts, your words. It's an important time, a time where the power of your words and the power of your expressions and love will have a great impact on many people. The floodgates of humanity are going to open to you. Publications you are presenting to the world are in themselves revolutionary and powerful statements about truth. Many spirits and angels will be working to put those books in the hands of seekers, of those who desire to be in light, and those who are in light. The work continues to grow and you continue to grow, and your progress continues to be swift and direct towards greater light, truth, and love.

I am very humbled to be your friend, and my love for you grows with each day. And do we not all thank God for what He has shared with us? His great Soul to our soul, such wonderful and powerful truths, which can save the world. May you contribute to God's plan to save the world with each and every day. Know that we are behind you, many, many of us are behind you and your efforts. The numbers upon the material plane will grow, those who will support you, those whom you will support, as this network continues to strengthen and become a vital and viable force in the world. As you rely on God's guidance and will, so this will become evident and you will see for yourselves the wonderment, power of God's blessings upon you and upon many.

I have such great joy in my heart in anticipation of crossing this threshold to the Celestial Kingdom. I am a living example of the power of prayer to receive God's Love. My soul has expanded and expanded. My understanding has grown and grown. My capacity for love is far beyond what I could imagine.

The greatness of God's universe is unfathomable, but indeed I touch a tiny corner of it and know the greatness of it. I am truly a child of God now. This soul redeemed, this mind willing to relinquish its hold upon those material things. Where I once feared the prospect of losing my intellectual faculties, now I relish in the thought. I am joyed by the transition. I have come to know the world and the universe in ways that I never thought possible. My world, my perception, my understanding, my truth is far beyond that which I held when on Earth. I am now a liberated soul, floating in the universe of God's Love, and in this, my joy, my gratitude, my knowing and my seeing, my love for God is what is important to me now.

I know you will join me one day in this great heaven of love, and we will do a little dance of joy when we see each other in that realm. I love you both, and I thank you both for your efforts, for your dedications, for your love. May you continue to release those conditions of the material world in favour of your soul, awakened, liberated, and filled with joy.

God bless you my friends. I am your friend, James, and I love you. God bless you. I am close. Know that I am close. God bless you.
