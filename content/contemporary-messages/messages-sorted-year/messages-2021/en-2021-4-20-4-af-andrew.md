# The Blessings of God

April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Andrew received by Al Fike

Your prayers have been heard, beloved souls. I am Andrew. We are collecting each one of you, gathering you together into this place that is enveloped with light, beyond the earth plane, beyond those conditions that would detract from these blessings. So we gather you together in this Circle of Light and indeed your souls rejoice in this. Our hope, our fervent hope, is that you will come to recognize, to feel and know this condition which we have built to house you in prayer so that your prayers may go further and deeper to God, so that your souls may open more fully to God's embrace and blessing upon you.

You are precious to us, beloved souls, for you continue to consistently reach out towards the Light and you continue to open yourselves towards the great blessings of God. So we gather you and those who are willing to come together and seek out these blessings. The power of such blessings will continue to entreat your soul to the transformational effects of this gift of Love. This process and blessing of transformation will come forth and heal your minds of all that is of error, all that distresses you and worries you for with Love comes the gift of peace, with peace strength of the soul builds, and faith becomes your friend, for there is nothing upon the earth plane that can truly harm you when you are in alignment with God. For it is this desire and prayer and reaching out that brings the heavenly cloak of protection, a touch from God upon you, each of you, so that you feel the upliftment, the joy, the peace that passes all understanding and you are given the gift of the Father's Essence within you.

We are together, you upon the earth plane and we who come from the Celestial heavens to pray with you. Together we create this place of light, this sanctuary that brings you closer to God. So we continue upon our journey of awakening, of healing, of joy, of love. May God bless you deeply, beloved souls. Open yourselves to all that God has to give you at this moment. In so doing you also open the door for God to use you as a blessing and channel for others so that they may be blessed.

God's gifts flow towards you at this moment. We are in oneness and unity of desire for all the highest gifts and blessings that God can give. God bless you and keep you close. I am Andrew, my love is with you. God bless you.
