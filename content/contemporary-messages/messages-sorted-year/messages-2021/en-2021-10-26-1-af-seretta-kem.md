Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

May God bless you deeply, my friends. I am Seretta Kem. Many of you are challenged by the earthly conditions, continue to struggle with the balance that you seek, that you will be spiritually attuned and in harmony as well as provide for your material necessities. This often presents to you a dilemma that is not readily resolved or given to clear guidance.

Yet, the great issue that is to be addressed is the power of your own faith in God’s plan and Will for you. Are you able to put aside your concerns, to be clear within your minds and release those concerns to God? In this way, it is an exercise of faith within the soul, a clear resolve, commitment to God and God’s Will. Much of your thoughts, energies go toward your worries and cares, your challenges and those conditions which draw you away from God.

Yet, it does not have to be so. Although we in the Celestial Kingdom have a far easier time as we are beyond these conditions and challenges, far beyond them. But still, we come to Earth to be with you, to uphold you, to guide you, to pray with you. We are readily aware of your challenges, even more so than you are for yourself. Yet, we continue to encourage you to release those worries and cares, to let go of the fears and that sense that you are not worthy or doing enough for God.

It is not easy to embrace joy when these things crowd your vision and your feelings. Yet, joy will bring the relief. Joy will demonstrate the power of faith and the blessings of love within your soul. I urge you to allow joy within your conscious self for joy does certainly reside within your souls. Allow this to bubble forth from within your consciousness. Allow yourself the freedom to be with God, to trust in God, to know that all is well despite the chaos around you, despite the challenges that manifest from many different directions. All is well because you have come to God in all earnestness and told God that you wish to serve Him and be with Him.

With this earnestness and dedication and desire, do you not think that God will clear the way so that you may truly serve him, be a light in the world? God indeed has many gifts to give you, blessings to bestow upon you. But as we have said to you many times, it is your resistance, your lack of faith, your fear which holds back many of these blessings and gifts. You must address these challenges directly. Allow yourself to see beyond the fog of these conditions that you perpetrate and are a part of and to go to God in faith, to ask for His blessings and His peace and His Love, to enshroud you in light, awaken you in love.

As we have said many times, it is a day-by-day process and journey depending upon your efforts in prayer, your efforts to discipline your mind and to let go of those conditions that are not in harmony with love. As you do so, so the joy will emerge more intensely and so your perceptions will clarify and be powerful and so your capacity to love not only yourself but others will deepen and become more powerful.

The journey is your journey. The responsibility rests upon you my friends. Awakening comes as you invite it into yourself. Truth manifests within you because you are willing to put aside the human condition and accept and embrace all that is of God. Many would hold you back from this whether they be your loved ones or friends or those you meet in your daily life. Many do not understand. Those close to you are fearful. They sense the power of love to change, to bring healing, to bring deep perceptions and those who carry the burdens of their own pain and misconceptions often wish for you to join them in this.

So, you are struck often within  this dilemma of being detached from these conditions. Yet, the love and bonds you have with your brothers and sisters in the world often demand a price that you must relinquish this detachment and join those who insist upon your dedication to them. I say to you, my beautiful, beautiful friends, you can do both without compromising your own spiritual condition but you must be clear within yourself what it is that you desire and how it is that you will manifest this desire.

When this clarity comes to you, when you are strong in it, in the light of truth, in the light of love, then those close to you benefit greatly from your condition, your strength, and your perceptions. Your capacity to love will grow. Your ability to see clearly through the challenges of life will empower you to make those decisions that are in harmony with God’s Will and God’s plan and His laws.

As you continue to progress upon this path, the path that transforms the soul and in times transforms all, you are at that place of choice. Not that that opportunity to choose diminishes or is specific to one particular situation at a particular moment. Rather, it goes on and on as God challenges you with love. Your soul challenges you with its own awakening.

Because of the conditions of your world, these challenges seem never-ending, and you walk a fine line between engaging in the human condition and engaging in God’s great reality. You will find your way. As you practice day in and day out to walk this fine line and find the harmony that is necessary, there will be changes and results from your actions. Until you are within that clarity and light and love and condition that is in alignment with God, the gifts that you seek, the manifestations that you are eager to bring forth will not be given. Not because you are unworthy but because you are still immature in your perspective, your journey. More growth, strength, faith is needed.

God will not deny you anything but in God’s wisdom, He gives to those who are prepared and ready to receive. So we prepare you and we urge to be at the ready for that which will come. We do not give you some illusions and misinformation regarding this journey. It is indeed a challenging one but one that must be made if you are to fulfill your tasks to be God’s instruments upon the world.

As you continue to progress further and release more that is not of love and carry the torch of truth with you without faltering, without compromise, then all is given and all will flow readily and your struggles will dissipate, beloved souls, and love and joy will be your truth and your life. This comes. It is not unobtainable but it comes in the timing that you set and are willing to proceed within. As you come to acknowledge the obstacles upon your path, those things within which need healing from God’s Love, be clear, my beloved souls, as you journey forward. Be resolute as you encounter the many challenges of life. Be loving as others challenge you.

Each of you has a great light. Within your soul is great light. May that light shine through all of you, every aspect of you, so that you may find with these the journey toward clarity, harmony, and love.

May God bless you on that journey and keep you in His Love always. We are with you. We will never abandon you, beloved souls, but continue to journey with you. We await your choices, your efforts, your prayers, your desires to be in alignment with God more fully and completely.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Seretta Kem and I am with you, always with you to help, to guide, to assist you. God bless you, beloved souls.
