# Reach for Alignment to be in the Highest Condition

September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

Thank you for your beautiful prayer. I am professor Salyards and I wish to talk about your progress to date, how indeed you have experienced many things and perceived many things along this short road that has brought you together. The word alignment has been used by many of you and it is a very appropriate word, for it is in the focusing and alignment of your perceptions, your desires, your gifts, your soul, with God that will bring the most sought-after results. Think of yourself as a lens that is out of focus, that indeed it takes effort and a bit of concentration to focus that lens in the way that all the elements of your being come into alignment, and the light is not diffused but travels almost like a laser to God. With this alignment comes a powerful response from our Creator because you have learned how to use the mechanisms of your soul, spirit and mind to bring about a direct response from God.

When you dwell upon the many psychic and mindful avenues that may come as you pray together in the dark room, this indicates that you are somewhat out of focus, that these things are drawing your attention and bringing you to a place where the observation of these aspects within you is more acute and more interesting than that place of dedicated prayer. There is nothing wrong with this, beloved souls, I am not criticizing you, but I am suggesting that you can go higher and deeper than these aspects that you are perceiving. Though it is understandable that you are caught up in these perceptions and experiences because they are not usual in your life, here we are reaching for the highest. Here we are focusing you all upon the goal at hand. When each of you are in alignment with yourselves and with God, then can you imagine the intensity of the light that beams forth to Godâ€™s Great Soul? Can you imagine the intensity of God's response coming to you and bringing to you a great opening of Love to your soul, a blessing that indeed assists you in greater focus, greater alignment?

It is not difficult to seek God in this way, for each of you do so with your prayers and your efforts often, as you seek out your quiet corner in prayer. Together, especially in the dark room, you generate such energy, such a multiplicity and many layers of energies and heart expressions and the blending of your psychic abilities that it creates a condition that is difficult to move beyond into that greater clarity of the soul resting with God, awakening to the Love that is given.

This is your challenge, beloved souls, this is a great challenge, for you are experiencing many new things. You are focused upon often mindful and emotional aspects of yourselves. Indeed, there is much that gathers and travels amongst you in this regard, making for a powerful condition that is hard not to relate to or notice in these, our prayers together. It is time however for you to go beyond this, to truly align yourself with God, to truly be in that place of deep repose, of peace, of the Presence of God known with you in prayer. In this way, you do not present any obstructions to the efforts and purpose that we put to your circles in order to create and have a material manifestation within it.

This does seem to be a bit of a contradiction, I know, but the less you focus upon this task, the easier it is for us to accomplish those things that are necessary in order to create the right conditions for manifestation. This detachment is important, for you carry with you many conditions that are a part of this environment of the earth plane that are counterproductive to what we are doing together. So, it is best that you be uplifted, clear, simple, and in harmony within yourself, and together, as you pray together, as you are together in loving harmony.

Seek for the highest, my friends, it is the key to everything. Seek for your souls to open to God, for it is in the power of Love, the Divine Love within your soul, that you will reach the pinnacle of these efforts. Indeed, each of you are yearning for this, each of you desire to complete your task together before you leave from this beloved circle. So, we give you this guidance knowing that what you have accomplished so far, what you have experienced and noticed and perceived, has all helped you upon your own personal journey of soul awakening.

Now it is time to coalesce into a clear and beautiful Circle of Light, to be undeterred, not distracted, clear and focused with your prayers. When you come to that place where indeed the distractions are great and the perceptions are intense, I ask you to seek out our help so that you may go beyond this to that pure place of being and knowing, which is communing with God. Allow His Love to flow deeply within you, abundantly. Seek this out in yearning and prayer and desire. Seek for the highest and know that your angel friends are close, that you are indeed stepping into a sacred circle, one with great potential, one that has been developing in these past few days and before that time that you will come together, and will continue to develop as you progress along day by day, month by month, year-by-year. The development is not just a part of a designated time together, it is an ongoing effort that will be honed by your daily practice and your daily efforts.

You are being prepared for a time when the world will be in great need of you, where God will be in great need of you, and we come to nurse you along and assist you in that great effort to reach for the highest, to be blessed deeply in your souls, to walk in the Grace of God so that all that you do, all that you think and speak. All that is within you, is in alignment with God. In this way you will be a powerful and clear channel for God to benefit all upon this world.

Much is still to come, my friends, and much is still to unfold, but you are indeed upon the right track. You are not veering far from this straight and narrow path, and we are here to assist you always, to be your beloved friends who desire the best and the highest, the most beautiful and the most wondrous for each of you.

May God bless you on that journey. I am Professor Salyards. I am happy to speak to you today. I am with you so very close as you continue to pray together and work together. God bless you. God bless your beloved souls with a great inflowing of the Divine Essence. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
