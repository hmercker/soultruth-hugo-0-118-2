# Sharing the Love of God

June 28<sup>th</sup>, 2021 

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here your brother in Christ, Francis. You have been informed that although you can receive the Love of God you cannot put His Love into another soul, for only God can do this. But as you may know when you love others with God’s Love you touch them, you make an impression with grace. 

If you give something out of obligation, for instance, to a church or to a cause, or even if you were to begrudgingly feed someone who is hungry, though it may benefit the receiver, since it is conditional, this does not help the soul to progress. A good deed it is but for you, who are in transition from the mortal to the Divine, we ask you to love unconditionally. 

One does not need to be wealthy in terms of the material world to give. Sometimes a smile can do more for a person’s day than whatever riches you might imagine that they need, whatever material things. Of course it is always good to provide to those in need. I have some experience with that myself and I continue to encourage not only my brothers, but all to feed the hungry, clothe the naked or those in need, and provide shelter. I say if you can do this personally with the Love of God in your heart and soul, that gift will bless both the receiver and the giver and lift you both up. 

When you leave this sanctuary today, I would suggest staying in the glow in the light and in the grace of this prayer, so blessed by God, that you may be a channel of His light and love as you wish to be. With all my love and the blessings from Above. Go in peace. I am your brother and friend in Christ. I am Francis from Assisi, now a Celestial angel. God bless you.
