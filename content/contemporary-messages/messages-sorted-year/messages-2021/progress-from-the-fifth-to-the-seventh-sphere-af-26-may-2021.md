# Progression from the Fifth to the Seventh Sphere

May God bless you, beautiful souls. I am Barbara<sup>1</sup> and I have been with my beloved friends for this evening. I wish to compliment my dear Terry on her efforts in the kitchen. She has learned something and has put forth her efforts in loving ways. How happy I am to see my beloved and beautiful friends together.
I want to tell you that I am now progressed into the seventh sphere. I wish to make some comments about my journey so far as I’m sure each of you are interested in what it will be like for you to traverse these various spheres of spirit heading toward the Celestial Kingdom. 

Oh, how I loved the beautiful conditions of the fifth sphere and all the loving people, joyful and spiritual people that I met in this sphere. I thought that indeed I would be a part of this sphere for a long time for it felt very comfortable indeed, very beautiful and I felt at home. For the first time, I felt at home for I never really felt at home in the physical plane. Because of my gifts, it was difficult to be in the earthly plane but I worked diligently for God and for my own progression in that plane. I earned a place in the fifth sphere which seemed like the greatest reward I could ever imagine, this place so full of love, this place so beautiful and resplendent in all the glorious beauty of God’s Creation and loving Touch upon it. I prayed earnestly and often for my soul to grow, to continue to grow, because as you know and I knew that the progression of the soul continues on and on.

So I progressed into the sixth sphere which is the way which this great journey works. Again I must tell you that I felt out of place, that indeed it felt like I was in some science fiction movie where people dressed and lived in a Utopian environment, where they loved to speak of the things that did not truly interest me. Rather, I felt like I was not truly a part of the conversation or the condition in which I felt myself in. It is not that this place lacked beauty for it did indeed. It had many, many aspects and particulars that were quite impressive and beautiful but it did seem to lack one crucial thing and that was the joy of the soul. How I missed that. It was so prevalent in the fifth sphere but not so much in the sixth and higher sphere.

So, as you have been told by other spirits, and I will reaffirm this knowledge and truth, that those who are more in tune with God and with their own soul do not linger in this sphere that is focused more on the intellectual understandings and the moral teachings and all those things that are of the mind, the mind very much refined and the soul pure, absolutely pure, but not elevated in the Divine Love and so I moved on to the seventh.

Again, I felt such joy, such beauty. I felt so at home in this place where I now reside. Now that I look on to my life in the material world and those experiences and my family and my friends and all whom I have connected with over the years, in the seventh sphere, it seems very far away, like being on a very tall building looking down upon the street and feeling detached from this place. Although indeed, in my heart and all those feelings in me, there is a deep connection with those I love who reside upon the Earth plane.

 I have been with many of you, many times and every one of you here on this screen and in this room, know that I have been with you for I have had a great joy and feel a great purpose in making this connection, in being of service, uplifting and praying for you all and bringing my gifts and my light to help you all. I know and it is fresh in my mind how difficult it is upon your plane. I have come to realize over the years on this plane, how much help I received from my angel friends and those spirit friends who came close and were drawn by my soulful aspirations and desires to be of service to God, to my beloved friends and to humanity. 
 
I drew many to me in this regard. Now I want to be one of the many who are drawn to you, to help you, to uplift you. If I have some bit of guidance to give you, I will do so. I realized when I passed over that I have many gifts that came to light, that it was no longer a mystery or something that was expressed haphazardly. But these things came into clear focus and I was able to utilize these gifts in a more profound way for others. I prayed to God to be able to do so. Indeed, many very helpful teachers and spirits in the fifth plane and higher came to help me, to help me adjust and to help me come to know myself more clearly and the beautiful gifts that God has laid within my soul so that they may be awakened more fully and my understanding of these things, deeper and richer in my life’s experience.

So, to you this journey may seem quick. But for me, in these planes of spirit which have no sense of time, it feels like another lifetime has passed. I have learned so much and experienced so much in this time in my progression. Indeed, in your time when you come here you will find the same that there are many things that seemed hidden or half hidden to you when you were on the Earth plane that will come to light more fully. You will sense a great joy, a wonderment at what God has created which is you and your beautiful soul. 

You will find that there are many things within you that have been activated and have indeed have had their expressions upon the Earth plane but it is clearer and deeper and more alive within you when you are in your spirit body and when you come to truly know your soul, for it is in knowing your soul, my friends, where the great revelations come and the understanding of all those teachings that our beloved angel friends have given us, come alive and are truly a part of you and your conscious self. 

Your consciousness shifts from those concerns of the material world, those worries and  cares that fall away as you come into greater alignment with God and you are not burdened by a physical body that distracts you and a physical world that often lures you away from your true self. You come to know that wondrous creature filled with great gifts, great light, and great potential that will continue to unfold as the teachers say, like petals of a flower and its true beauty revealed.

Continue to pray for God’s Love, my friends. I will come and pray with you. My wish is that you will feel me close, that you will come to know me as a helper and a guide, as a channel of love for the benefit of your journey and progress towards God. Indeed, I want you to pray for this world of yours which is in such need of peace, comfort and love. So much, so much needs to come to your world. It requires those who are strong enough and able, filled with soulful love to reach out to your brothers and sisters. Embrace them, and tell them that they are loved and that God loves them more than they can imagine or understand.

It is the power of love, my friends, that will heal the world. It is the power of love that connects you all, one to another so that you have a sense that you belong, that you are a part of a family. It is God’s Love that heals the inner wounds. It is God’s Love that opens the vision. It is God’s Love that brings you together in unity. It is God’s Love that will guide you forward into deep, deep progress, understanding, joy and true insights into yourself and into everyone. 

This power of Love is what we come together to pray for. This power of Love continues to stimulate the progression of many spirits until they too come to that place where they are a part of the great family that exists in the Celestial Kingdom and all those wonderful insights, perspectives, experiences and a depth of Love that comes with a redeemed soul.

I am on the verge of entering this kingdom. I have such a great love and appreciation of our Heavenly Father, and how God has made this possible for if it were up to me, I would not know how to make this journey come to fruition. But it is God in His wisdom who has guided me and guides you and will show you the road to take, will allow you to see with eyes of the soul this unfolding journey, the opening doors, the beautiful light. 

My friends, we are all on a journey to God and in this journey we will indeed find fulfillment, deep, deep fulfillment and joy. May you come to see this more clearly every day, my friends. For every day God sends his angels to uplift you. Every day you have the opportunity to awaken and grow in Love. Be with God now, my friends. We are all in God’s Grace, the peace that passes all understanding. We are all together in this place of light where God is putting His Hand upon each one of us and saying, “You are my child. I love you. Come and be embraced by your Father who loves you so and know the peace in my embrace.” We are here together. We are here to receive His love. So, we shall, my friends. So we shall. 

God bless you. I am Barbara. I am so happy to be with you today through my beloved son whom I love so dearly, who has learned and grown much over the years and his light continues to grow as with his mate, as with his sister, his two sisters, my dear sisters. God bless you all. God bless you.
