# This Longing

April 11<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh<br />    



You stand in front of the door

Peeping through the keyhole to the beyond

The key in your pocket 

your hand on the doorknob.<br />
   

You don’t know 

that you hold the key

Or even that the door is unlocked

But somehow 

You restrain yourself 

from the delight of turning the knob 

And pushing open the door

though it is your hearts Desire.


Your soul sitting in limbo waiting on 

the arrival of something 

that you already possess. 

This longing is all you have ever needed 

to walk through the door 

of the Creators Abode 

Where love reigns Supreme.


Take this step

To infinite Grace

and a place of no regrets 

In God’s Embrace 



I am Hafiz 

Go in Peace my brother
