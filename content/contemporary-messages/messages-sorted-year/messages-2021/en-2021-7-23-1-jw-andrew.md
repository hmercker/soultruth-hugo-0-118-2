Andrew received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the blessings of God's Love sweep into your souls, beloved and beautiful souls that you are, who continue to gather together in light. So you are blessed according to your dedication, the sincerity of your prayers, the depth of your desire to be with God, so you are blessed. And for those who do not feel these blessings, I say to you that you will in days to come feel this blessing from God and know it as your friend and your helper to awaken your soul and to bring you into alignment with all that is of God. Do not despair, beloved souls, but rejoice in this great gift that is God's gift of love to each one of you. Do not shrink away from God but step forward and beseech God to bless you mightily within your souls for this is God's desire, that you may be blessed and uplifted and in the Light of His great grace and presence.

You are His children and you indeed have earned a place at the great banquet of His blessings and Love. It comes to you because you have desired this, because you have prayed for this, and so it shall be that all that your souls desire will come to be in accordance to God's Will and God's plan for you. Indeed, you know this within yourselves, you know your true self, you know that place within you that seeks to be in harmony with love, with God's Laws of Love, with all that is of God. This thirst that is never quenched will continue and bring you to this mighty table where you may drink your fill of love and know your true self in this blessing.

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Andrew and I am with you often in your prayers, in your times with God. I am with you, my love and blessings for each of you. Beloved souls, you are truly loved and shall truly know love beyond measure, beyond all that is of the mind, that you may be indeed be in alignment with your soul and with God. God bless you, God bless you dearly. Andrew loves you.
