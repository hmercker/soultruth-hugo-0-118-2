September 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice Retreat, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. You carry forth the light and the blessings to your fellow seekers of development for the Direct Voice in other parts of the world and those who are in a supportive, prayerful place with you at this time. We have joined you all together into one cohesive Circle of Light, and in this you will feel expansion of your circle, the expansion of the light that is a part of your circle. Indeed, there are many more spirits and angels and others who are supporting you and a part of this great effort. In this way you are able to bring greater light to your world, greater blessings to one another.

This interconnectedness of various groups and individuals in the world will continue to be forged and strengthened. You will all feel a kinship and a sense of direction together as you strive to open those doors of great light and great purpose, for the blessings of humanity to come forth, the blessings of God given in abundance. So we lift you all up into this beautiful condition of light. Together, we are in prayer. Together we seek these blessings. Together, we are all God’s instruments upon the world.

May you seek and know this great blessing upon you. May all of you sense the depth power, respond together in love. May you see that it is not just your small circle but many others. Indeed, these circles will multiply, encompass the Earth in time, helping to bring the light and the healing that God intends to give to all in your world; part of God’s plan to uplift humanity.

Beloved brothers and sisters upon the earth plane, may you continue to seek for the highest, the blessings from God in all that you do, that His Love may shine forth within your souls, around you, through you, channels of Love, beacons of Light. You are blessed, beloved souls, deeply blessed. I am Seretta Kem and I embrace you all. God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you.
