I am here, John the Apostle. I am with you as you engage the longings of your souls in prayer to receive the Love of God. There is an expression in the world, *“All things will come about in good time”.* This was adapted from the original, *“Allow all things to come forth in God’s time”,* and you are all in God’s time in this circle. When you are engaged in the world, in all the material things that are necessary and you fall out of harmony because you are overwhelmed with concern, fear, with doubt, take that time of your engagement with the world and turn it on its head. As soon as you feel the separation between your soul and God’s soul, call out to God. Be conscious of the separation and ask to be at One, ask to be brought back into God’s time, God’s grace. 

When you do this, we are dispatched for your needs whatever they may be, to assist you in whatever way we can, but first and foremost, of surrounding you with love that your soul may be brought back into harmony with its Creator. Secondarily, we assist on the material plane but generally those tasks are given to progressive spirits for we in the Celestial realms, our task that we have chosen is to always bring you back to God’s love. To influence you, to inspire you, all the while respecting your free will. So, call on us and know we will never abandon you. Remember to be in God’s time that you may turn around an inharmony into a grace. I shall step back to be in this prayer with you in God’s time. Will all my love and blessings I am your brother in Christ always. I am John.
