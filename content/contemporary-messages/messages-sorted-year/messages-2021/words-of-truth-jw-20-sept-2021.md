May the peace and love and grace of God be upon you. When you pray and you open to the love of God, no doubt, no fear, no worry is present. Only grace and this Peace. May it be upon you all, peace unto this world. 

I am Mary; sometimes referred to, not only as the mother of Jesus, but with the words *“The Immaculate Conception,”* and I am aware that there are those of you who have received the truth of Jesus’ birth that I was not a virgin, and that Joseph is indeed his father. Some have found those words, *“Immaculate conception”* as being an error, assuming they are referring to my son’s conception by the Holy Spirit of God.  

I should like you to consider another point of view, to not be at odds with those who refer to me as such. For my son was born into the world without sin, a unique soul, and therefore he did not carry the sins of his father’s forefathers and ancestors and can be considered one conceived immaculately and free from sin. 

All these terms such as *“Holy communion”*, *“A state of Grace”*, *“Baptism”* and *“The Light”* may have been in corrupted in error by those who perhaps did not understand but who wished to convey truth from their understanding or lack thereof. 

These terms do carry real truth for we are presently in Holy communion with the Heavenly Father in a state of Grace and Baptized in His Love. You may use these terms in truth, and they may be quite helpful when you wish to express the truths of Divine Love and the path to the Celestial Kingdom to others, especially those who you may consider orthodox or part of organized religion. For their aspirations are true but they lack the understanding of the simplicity of prayer. 

Each one here can become a catalyst and an inspiration by bringing the light in your souls and God’s love to others. Be not afraid, be in grace. And all that is not in harmony will disappear in the light of God’s Love. I open my arms to you with all the love of a mother, with the deepest wish for each one to receive the blessing of God’s Love, to be changed, to be One. May the Love of God be with you. Go in peace. With all my love, I shall step back and now be in prayer with you. I am Mary.
