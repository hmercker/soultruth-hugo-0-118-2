Guardians of the Light, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus & Orion received by Al Fike

**Orion** is here. Also, your beloved brother Jesus is here. Together, we form a powerful alliance of light and love focusing our efforts upon your world, focusing love to those who are making great effort to rise above the human condition.

I will answer your questions and do so to the best of my ability when the time comes. My beloved friends, do not worry about what may come through but have faith that the energy and channel will be opened in order to accomplish the task. It is important that humanity comes to know the wonderful variation of creation that is God’s universe, comes to know that there are friends who are available to you, who reside on other planets in the universe and yet are accessible because of their accomplishments and gifts of the soul which allow this communication to take place.

We are multidimensional in our existence. This comes with soul awakening and development. We can travel at will, vast, vast distances, for within the dimension of the spirit world, travel is easily done depending upon the conditions and opportunities that exist.

So, I will assure you that we will continue in our collaborations, that there will be much given to you, dear daughter, in your desire to share the various truths and understandings that we wish to give to humanity. It will not be so difficult when you are settled within the flow and routine of your writings. As you have already noticed, you are receiving much information now. I would urge you to sit with your pen in hand and paper and ask to be guided with the flow of words that will connect and communicate with others, those who will be reading these words.

You need not worry about giving others a disclaimer for these are not your words, for in essence, they are. We merely communicate with you telepathically in order to help you come, to lay down the flow of words in such a way that you convey the truth of the matter. We may also come when you are together in this place and deliver messages that may be added into your books that are relevant to the topics at hand. Thus, a collaboration between this instrument and yourself will help expedite your efforts in publications.

I am open to your questions at this time if there are any queries about your collaborations together. I will give you a moment to think if you are so inclined to ask something of me.

*(there is a brief pause in the audio)*

So, I assume then you are clear on the matter and you will proceed accordingly.

Now I will give way to my beautiful brother Jesus who wishes to speak to you as well.

Yes, I am with you. I come. I am your brother and friend, **Jesus**. I understand your dilemmas in regard to sharing my name with your writings, beloved daughter. There has been such harm done in my name that you do not wish encourage others who might read your words to associate this error and difficulty in reconciling who I am with what I have reportedly done in the world or those things that have been done in my name that are of gross error. So, you need not worry, beloved daughter, in regard to this issue.

Claim the words for yourself. Speak as one who speaks truth. Be a channel of light. It matters not that others must know of the source of these gems of wisdom and love that are shared. It matters not to me. It only matters to me that these things are shared, that the truth rings forth throughout the world. I do not claim this truth for this truth is of God. I am merely His instrument as are you. So, we travel this road together as instruments of God, as His beautiful channels of light and truth and love.

I relinquish all concern and responsibility and even guilt that you may accumulate through sharing these writings without acknowledging the source of them. If all is done in love, then what is the harm? When all is given in truth, then how can you suffer the consequences of compensation if you do so in the name of love and truth and your love of God? We must all move forward in the ways and means that will expedite sharing of this truth to the world.

Each of you has your part to play. Each of you is gifted in certain ways, unique ways that will help to bring a certain perspective to those who are receptive and desire to learn, to grow, to be in the truth, to be in light. This is not hard work, beloved, beloved friends, to bring the light of truth to many. This truth is simple. Yet, because of the many conditions of your world and the way in which humanity has evolved, there are many aspects and implied conditions which have been created by man.

So, for humanity to understand these things, these conditions and complexities need to be addressed so they may see that they have created such a structure, a paradigm of existence that they are not free of and are not within the flow of pure love, unconditional love and harmony. This structure contaminates the minds universally upon this world of yours. So, you struggle as well, my friends, you struggle to see beyond these human paradigms of thought to that place of soul purity and innocence and truth.

But it comes as you continue to grow in the Father’s Love. You awaken slowly but surely as you trod your path toward God. As you continue to exercise your free will, your desires, the intentions of your soul, so you draw the angels and others into your midst to support and uplift you. This is part of God’s laws. The Law of Attraction and the Law of Love bring their benefits, bring the blessings to you which assist you in releasing yourselves from these constrictions and structures of thought that clutter and restrict your journey.

As you continue to release these old conditions and concepts and ideas, so you will feel the challenge of this. It will feel difficult. It will often give you a sense of confusion and doubt for the mind continues to insist upon its well-formulated ideas and structures and patterns. Yet, the soul knows with greater wisdom a truth that is somewhat foreign to the processes of the mind so the mind does not trust these perceptions, this new way of being. The mind fabricates excuses and thoughts that harbour doubt, even heavy emotions which make the journey difficult and burdensome.

You must understand yourselves, beloveds, how these things work and how you have inherited the burdens of your forefathers. They cling to you as well as the experiences you have had in your earthly life that have formed your mindful condition and patterns of thought.

As you continue to grow in the Fathers’ Love, so you will release these things. It is inevitable. These things cannot cling to you forever. As you continue to pray and ask to be cleansed of all that which is not of love, all that which is of error, all that which binds and constricts your soul and your mind, so these things must fall away for God hears your prayers. God continues to reach out and soothe you and comfort you with His Love, heal you of these things that are hard and burdensome.

Indeed, love grows within you. You begin to accept love for yourself and love for your brothers and sisters, love for God, love for life. This grows and strengthens while the contrary conditions weaken and dissolve. This is the process of the transformation of the soul. You are truly well within that process. Be true to yourselves, beloveds. Be true to love, to life, to all that God has created. In this you will know deep joy and peace. You will know fulfillment and wisdom. You will know what it is to truly love.

May you continue to grow upon your journey to God. May you share your wisdom with others in whatever way will reach them. You will be guided. You have God’s full Love, support, blessings upon you. When you come up against error, if it is within you or another, you will know, you will see, and you will correct this as the wisdom of your soul informs you, as God’s blessings upon you ensure the truth will grow within.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Jesus and I am with you in your efforts always, always with you, beloved souls. God’s blessings upon you, a mighty flow that will never cease. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you.
