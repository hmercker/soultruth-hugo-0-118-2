I am here, your brother and friend in the love of God, I am Yogananda. Be at peace my brothers and sisters for we are all children of God. I encourage you to radiate love as the Creator brings this love into your soul, as you open your hearts, in this peace. You are a receiver and a transmitter to those who are suffering. So radiate love and picture them whole. What you focus on will manifest, therefore it is important to focus on love, to focus on peace.  To speak and walk and talk and sing with love. 

It is the magnetism of God’s Love that has drawn each one to this circle, each soul wishing to be lifted up, awakened, transformed and healed. This magnetism can transform each soul for it carries with it the essence of the Father. This essence, this gift, is joy, is bliss and it is magnificent beyond the world, and yet in the world you are. 

When you focus on that which is less than love, when you are troubled, when you indulge in negativity, you draw that to you. So many in the world find themselves in what seems a never-ending circle of despair and loneliness, anger and helplessness. Turn the light in your soul on. Let it shine on every being. When clouds of doubt come around, go to God, for He will dispel them as the rays of His love enter your soul. Be still and know you are worthy. We are all God’s children; Let no one convince you otherwise. 

Each one here is a beautiful heart. I can see the glow and we here can feel your intentions, so we come in love and peace and prayer. Open and allow the great gift of Divine Love to change you that you may be a blessing in this world so in need, so in need. God loves you. We love you. May the joy and bliss of the Essence of the Creator be yours. With all my love and blessings, I am your brother and friend in God’s love. I am Yogananda. Go in Peace. Go in peace.
