# A Little Drama Goes A Long Way

James Padgett received by Jimbeau Walsh

I am your brother and friend James Padgett. As always, I give my blessing to this work and I am honoured that you have chosen my life and my work as a template for presenting Divine Love to the world.

Iâ€™ve already made more than a few suggestions through my dear brother Fike and I would add this: as an attorney when I considered presenting a case and I wanted the jury or the judge to be in sympathy with what I was presenting I had to consider the facts as you have, the make-up of the jurors, and you can read that as emotional, spiritual, physical. But at the end of the day, I wanted to leave no doubt about the innocence or guilt, the legality or illegality of anything in question. So, it is important to inspire and as I have recommended previously to use excerpts and at the end of the day ask yourself what is it, I wish to convey? What truth do I wish to share and make a deep impression? You can only do as much as you are able and because you all have rather amazing gifts, I would suggest that this shall be rather easy and should run smoothly. Only to add never forget that the Love of God and what you wish to convey be of the highest. A little drama goes a long way.

With all my love and blessings and deep gratitude, I am truly your brother and friend and the Grace of God. God bless you. I am James Padgett.
