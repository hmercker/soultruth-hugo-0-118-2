Mary received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Mary. I want to assure you that the world will come into light in time. That though there may be dark periods ahead in the evolution and events of your world in the future, the world will come to light. Each of you is holding and becomes a great stanchion of strength and light, holding this great light within the world, this Lattice that continues to grow. In your persistence and strength, you will hold this light in place. No matter what conditions may prevail within your world, you will hold this light in place. And your strength, your prayers, your dedication will be blessed and upheld by God.

May you continue to be a part of His plan. May you see with your own eyes, know with your souls and your minds that you have a part to play and that you will hold the light in place. You and your beloved brothers and sisters, dedicated to light, will hold the light in place. And you will provide through your efforts a sanctuary, a refuge for many souls seeking light, and comfort, and peace, and truth, that love will prevail where you are in the world. You will be a channel to bring this blessing of light to many.

You have become the pillars in place to hold this great fabric of light. May you truly know this. May you truly come to accept your part in this dynamic and transformative time in the world. Dedicate yourself to God, beloveds, dedicate yourself to the awakening of your soul in prayer that the shifts of truth may come into your mind and change your perspective because your soul has begun to awaken and has brought truth into your consciousness. As you receive more of God's Love so you feed this change, this transformation within, and all will unfold in beauty, in joy, in love. Wisdom will flow through your lips. Light will shine through every part of your being. Love will be a great cornerstone of your life. This is the power of Gods' Love to heal, to awaken, to transform and to bring truth through you as a great channel of light which continues to develop and strengthen. Through you is the opportunity that God has to reach others. Allow yourself to be a humble servant, to be simple in your ways, to be steadfast in your effort, to be true to God's Will.

And so the journey continues to unfold and you continue to walk upon this Divine path which will be your journey for all eternity. We are with you, beloveds, we are with you never to leave, the stalwarts of light upon the world. May God bless you, beloveds. I am Mary. My love for you is great. God bless you and keep you in His Love.
