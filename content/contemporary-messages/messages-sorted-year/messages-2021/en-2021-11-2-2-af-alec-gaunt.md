# Comes to Reinforce the Message from Jesus that We are All Needed

November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Alec Gaunt received by Al Fike

…to you, my beautiful friends, souls who carry the Truth of the Father’s Love within them. I am Alec and I come to reinforce the message that you received this morning, Jesus calling you all to step forward and bring this message of love and truth to humanity.

When I walked the Earth, which was not that long ago, I too committed myself to step forward and bring this truth to others, and I was somewhat successful in my efforts. But I also received a lot of criticism, and a number of people turned away from me because they thought my message was too religious for their liking. Yet, the message that you carry and what I carried was not, in my mind, particularly religious, for I see religion as doctrines and dogmas that men have put forward to describe the spiritual journey. Yet, the spiritual journey is in essence, a journey taken by each individual to God, and that in a way, cannot be described or standardized amongst people. Rather, it is your own testimony and your own vision and experience that creates the understanding of the journey.

Each of you will take this journey in a unique way and see it from unique perspectives. Some of you will apply your religious background and label things reflecting this. Others have ideas and concepts that they have borrowed from other perspectives. Yet all of you continue to come together time and time again to seek the Father’s Love, to seek this great blessing to enter into your soul. That is the one message, the one deep truth that requires the simple explanation that prayer is the key that opens the door. The desire of the soul enters through that door and is expressed to God, and in this expression and prayer comes God’s response. All the other ideas, concepts and structures of truth you have come across upon this path, are merely a reflection of absolute truth that must come to the soul when the soul is ready to receive it and to understand it. In this way, true understanding is an experience, rather than an arm’s length observation of something that is believed to be true.

The soul, when experiencing truth, feels a sense of joy, is awakened to truth and knows that it is God that has given this truth. In this way, the entire experience is difficult to convey in words, but indeed it is important that you try to share your experiences with others, to open that door and say, “Come in; this is a beautiful, tranquil, loving, peaceful place where God resides and we are in communion with our Beloved Creator.” No other way will suffice when it comes to truly knowing what it is that God wishes to convey to you. Indeed, it is important that you ask God to open the faculties of your soul so that you may come to know God and know the truth, know the truth of God’s Creation, God’s Laws, God’s Love, all of these things that are a part of the soul’s experience and journey toward atonement with God.

Yes, you may read many books, and we have channeled many messages containing many words. This I know, has helped many of you, has inspired you, has helped to keep you focused and on this path of love so that you are not distracted too greatly and stray too far from this path. I am not denigrating the words, I am merely suggesting that if you go deeper, you will go to that place beyond words. You will find the truth that is expressed within the soul and truly understood by the soul.

God whispers to you, my friends. He whispers His guidance and truth and love. He whispers to your soul. It is when you have the ears of the soul, the eyes of the soul, the mind of the soul, all in alignment, the truth may rush in. Sometimes like a mighty wind. Sometimes like the gentle song of a bird that whispers His sweet truth, sings it in harmony and melody that is gentle and joyful. So much is given to a soul that is open. So much comes when the soul is open.

So I encourage you my friends, to continue to pray for the Father’s Love to enter your soul, with all earnestness and desire and longing. For In this way, those things that I speak of today will become a truth within you and will live within you in a conscious and powerful way, so that you will not be confused or distracted or come away without that beautiful inspiration and joy that comes from God’s Touch upon you.

May God bless you my friends, I am Alec, and I continue to walk with you as do many in the Celestial Kingdom, come with you upon this journey in loving harmony, in loving intention, so that you may come to know the truth in all its dimensions and glory and light. God bless you, my friends. My love is with you. God bless you. I am Alec. God bless you.
