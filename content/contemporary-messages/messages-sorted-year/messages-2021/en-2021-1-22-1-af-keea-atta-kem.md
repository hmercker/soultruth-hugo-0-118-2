Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

God bless you beloved souls, I am Kea Atta Kem. I am happy to be here with you today as you continue in your dedications of prayer, desire to come together and bring Light into the world. And I urge you, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, use the power of prayer to help save your world, to elicit the Laws that come with this power so that you may open up the avenues and Portals of Light to bless many. As is so often with your understanding and perception of these Truths, you do not realize the power that you may wield with your efforts in prayer. The power of your soul in alignment with God brings forth this channel of Light to the world beseeching God to use you as His instruments, beseeching the angels to be close, beseeching the Holy Spirit to touch your soul. The very foundation of all of these things comes with your effort and prayer to awaken these Laws and powers of spiritual touch and awakening of God's Blessings upon the world.

Indeed, prayer needs your thoughts and your feelings; your desire to be in alignment; your desire to be a channel of Love; your desire to bring healing and balance and Love to your world. Be clear in your desires and do not just recite a prayer because you think and feel you must say certain words. Recite a prayer from your heart where deep feelings reside and send this to God. Whether you verbalize this or it is just a feeling, send it fourth. For the power is in those feelings not in the mindful constructs which help to articulate the feeling but are not the feeling in itself. It is important that you go deep and know within yourselves these true feelings and know within yourself those heartfelt desires. Indeed, as you continue to pray, know that it is an art and a science so that you may continue to discover the many aspects of prayer and hone these skills, this expression towards the soul to God.

In this way, you clear the channel between you and your Heavenly Father. And you continue to open this channel with your prayers, your intentions, your desires to bring Light into the world and into your own self. So much hinges and your effort, the clarity of your prayers, the heartfelt beauty of your prayers and the Light that comes with your prayers. Whether that prayer is for many minutes or a few moments, may they be pure and powerful and clear. In this, you will experience what prayer may bring to you; the great insights of the soul that may be ignited by your prayer and desire to know your own soul, those great blessings of God's Love which come with heartfelt prayer and the great inflowing that may come in response to great desire.

So much is reliant upon your efforts, my beautiful and beloved souls. It is at once a release of the control of your mind and an opening to the consciousness of your soul. Allow yourself to melt into this beautiful place of prayer and contemplation and be truly uplifted and blessed by it.

You are given a key. Each time you pray, you turn the key and unlock the door to God. Be with God now my beloveds. Know His gentle yet firm blessing upon you. Be uplifted in Love and be a channel of Light for the world. Blessings to you all. I am Keea Atta Kem and my love for each one of you is great. God bless you beloveds. God bless you.
