May the blessings of God’s Love be upon you. You who have traveled far and yet have found yourselves at the very beginning of a new life. When one embarks on a spiritual quest, it is often beyond their scope to be able to perceive what it is in fact they are seeking except to say that ultimately it is union with the Divine, with their Creator, with love. In the case of my dear brother here, my spiritual grandson, he has only just become aware that he started life as a very exuberant, abundantly energized, physical child with a very curious mind with a deep desire in his soul to find the highest. And so in relation to what you were reading earlier from Judas, in this one’s life, his growth went from a very physical being to an intellectual being to befriending his soul. Prayer and music played a large part in this as it does with many. But he sought manifestations. He wanted experiences that he did not find in the church he grew up with. He did not know that he wanted to experience God’s Love but he knew there must be something higher than this and so he read about me and my teachings and my interactions with students, and my constantly reminding them that the world was in a deep sleep and that humanity must awaken and that the conventional beliefs of who Jesus was, who he is, fell far short from the truth and were in fact mostly in error. I myself traveled to many lands, had many teachers, sought out the ancient and the eternal, and came to a place of spiritual awakening and a consciousness of the treasures of prayer. Constantly I sought guidance, and constantly I received it. And so I wish to touch on this subject of manifestations and spiritual experiences. 

The desire of one to be changed, to be enlightened, to be free, to be love is at the core of all seeking that is spiritual in nature. You may be aware that teachers have often used certain substances or chemicals to shock their students into a state of awareness of their mortality and hopefully an insight into immortality. This also can happen to one who has experienced deep trauma or loss in their lives. But to those who linger in sleep and find spiritual life to be no more than another entertainment or amusement, a teacher will often go to extreme lengths to awaken the somnambulant student so that one might begin to see.  I am not in any way recommending that you all go out and try some drug or another or put each other’s lives in peril, but I am saying that those who seek out manifestations are really looking for an ultimate connection with their Creator. All of these experiences, all these manifestations, whether they be the opening of the third eye with spiritual visions, or the perception of lights, spirit visitations, kundalini energies, and so forth are not to be equated with the experience of praying for and receiving the love of your Creator. They may lead to that place of true soul longings and it is always our great hope that this is so, but do not mistake the road for the destination.
     
And you, my dear ones, who have chosen this road on the highest path, I encourage you to make your day a prayer, make your journey a prayer. Talk to God and find a small, still place where you can hear His answer and feel His great love for you. I’m very pleased that I was able to deliver this message and I hope it will reach many and I thank you with all the gratitude of a grateful grandfather and one who is a transformed soul in the Heavenly Father’s Kingdom. May you all go with the grace of God and know I am here for you should you call. I am your brother and friend, I am Papa George, George Gurdjieff, God bless you, God bless you.
