# Implores us to bring greater light into the world

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Francis of Assisi received by Al Fike

...for your prayer and may God bless you deeply my friends, I am Francis of Asissi. I come because your beautiful world suffers greatly. In many, many different ways, there is great pain and suffering upon your world. The press of humanity upon your world is creating such a force that it is if not equal or greater than the power of nature that is upon this planet, and there is a great struggle between these two forces. The will of man and the Will of God are at odds, my beloved friends. It is not that man, or at least many, are consciously fighting against the Laws of Nature, but as a single body it is a formidable force creating disharmony and difficulty in the natural world. This you will come to see as very evident and will bring great waves of resistance and power to neutralize the condition of man in the world. You will all feel the impact of this. It is coming and it is now in your world.

How we look upon this beautiful world that God created and have great love for this world and for all of you, have great concern and sadness for what is evident at this time. Man has always turned against man. Man has imposed great suffering upon himself. But now, he is such a great force that he turns against the entire world in such a way that the creatures of the world suffer greatly. The creatures of the world continue to be confused and disoriented by these unnatural conditions that are brought about by man.

This is quite a dilemma, my friends. How do you act and respond accordingly? For I know that all of you within your hearts, desires harmony in your world, harmony in your lives, harmony within your hearts, and yet the dilemma persists, the suffering persists upon your world. Each of you have been given the invitation to change your ways, to walk in the world more gently, to be in harmony with God's Laws of Love rather than comply with man's laws that are created out of distortion and a lack of love.

Yet, often we come and bless you and uplift you, we come to encourage you and guide you, to inspire change within you, and God blesses you greatly with His Love, which is the highest agent of change in the universe. Yet, after you receive these blessings, you go about your daily business as if nothing has changed, although we understand that it takes time to absorb and come to acknowledge the truth that you have been given and to live by it. You are human, so we do not expect a miracle as you would think, of you, and a complete reversal of your attitudes and efforts in the world.

But indeed, you are required to choose and to make that choice each and every day, each and every breath, in order to establish harmony within yourself and establish harmony within your lives. How else will change happen in the world, my friends, but by those brave souls who wish to stand up as an example of change. Not to shout from the rooftops, to point fingers, to pick arguments, to call out those whom you see as in error. This is the way of man; to exact change through force, to bring harmony or at least supposed harmony, through the imposition of laws and edicts and efforts to sow guilt and shame etc., upon their fellow man. This is the way of man and it has not brought about harmony, rather it has done just the opposite.

The way of God is to awaken to love, to bring love wherever you go, to allow love to enlighten your thinking and your doing. Harmony comes with the inclusion of love with whatever you do. When you come within your mind and create edicts and judgments about the world, about individuals within the world, and all that is of mindful conceit and desire for dominance and power, you join the human condition and reinforce it. How many have walked the Earth in love? Certainly, our beloved brother Jesus did so and many If his disciples did so. Our beloved brother Gandhi did so, and there were other leaders in the world who did so, and their memories endure. Their examples were considered and written down for posterity.

Yet, the vast majority of humanity, though they understand and know that to take the higher road is to bring greater harmony, but often they do not. Often you do not, although you try, certainly we see this and we encourage this. But if there is true change to happen in your world, then there must be commitment towards change in such a way that there are powerful examples of this in the world and that those examples are examples of love in action, love pouring forth through the souls of individuals to all the souls upon this world and the next, love towards the creatures of the world, love towards all that is that God created, love towards God Himself.

It is love, my beloved friends, that brings the deep and great peace to the world that is so desired and so needed. Peace comes when you are in harmony with God's Creation. Peace comes when you are in harmony with yourself, in harmony between your minds and your souls, in harmony with the laws of God. Peace comes when you walk the Earth and express yourself in love and acknowledging and all the beauty and wonderment of creation.

Peace must come to this world, for the world has endured much and now it requires peace, and peace will come one way or another, my friends. If it is through the imposition of the natural world upon man in order to humble man, then so be it. It is man’s choice to live in this way, to be the detractor from peace. Yet, we give messages all over the world through many individuals who are inspired by the higher spirits and angels and by God, to bring the message to humanity that it is time to stop all that which is not in harmony with love. It is time to stop it within your minds, within your hearts and within your souls, that you may truly embrace love; love of yourself, love of all those around you, love of the Earth. It is needed in order for peace to come, in order for harmony to be truly a part of your world.

It is time, my friends, do you not feel this? Do you not see this? I implore you to open your eyes, to come to see that which causes you such heartache and pain and disharmony, to come to make that choice within you that you have had enough, that it is time to be in harmony with God, to receive His great Love in great abundance to such an extent that you are truly changed within your heart, and that this change will be exemplified through your mind and your actions in such a way that others will take notice. Do not hide away and be separate from the world, believing this is the only way to be a child of light and comfortable in that skin. I say to you, my friends, be a crusader of light. Be one who brings the truth of light to the world.

Though you may have many detractors and many will turn away, there will be those who hear you, who are inspired by you, who will walk with you. Not because you have given a political message or even a religious message, but you have given a truly spiritual message, one that is of the heart, one that is completely sincere and pure and clear, as you speak and act in the name of truth, in the name of love. Be a child of God truly my friends, and God will guide you and show you the way to be His instruments, to be a channel of love and truth, to be an agent of change in the world.

May you stand beside the likes of Jesus and Gandhi and the many others who have walked the world and been an example of love, these beautiful souls that have done so and whose footsteps you follow are with you in this effort, as are many millions of bright angels and spirits who are with you at this time, and implore you to walk in this light of truth, to be the example of this light of truth.

May God bless you on your journeys. Know that you are loved, deeply loved by God and nothing can change this. For, God's love for you is present for every moment of every day. Is your love for God's Presence in every moment of every day? May it be so. For, in this joining of love comes the answers to all dilemmas and all that is needed to transform your world so that it is truly in harmony and grace and light.

God bless you on this journey, my friends. I am Francis and my love for you is great, as it is for this world of yours, as it is for all of God’s Creation, as it is for my Heavenly Father, whom I love. God bless you, my friends. God bless you on your journeys. I love you. God bless you.
