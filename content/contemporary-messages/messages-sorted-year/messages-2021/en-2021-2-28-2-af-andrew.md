Andrew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Andrew. Today we are doing something somewhat different from our usual gatherings together, uniting you together in a condition of light that brings upliftment and blessings to you. Today, each of you remain in your place upon this Earth and have with you several angels who are gathering about you and uplifting you in this light. In so doing, you are being used as an instrument, a channel of light for those areas in which you live and those individuals which you are connected to, and some who you do not know but are indeed connected, soul to soul. So we multiply our efforts together, helping to reinforce and increase the expanse of the Lattice of Light that is destined to cover the world.

You are being deeply blessed at this time and also used effectively and powerfully as Godâ€™s instruments. The effectiveness of these blessings that may flow through you is determined by your desire and condition of the love within your soul. In this way, the power may be amplified, the blessings may flow and all my come in deep and powerful waves of light. May the blessings continue to flow within your souls and through your souls for the benefit of your brothers and sisters in the world.

God bless you beloveds, I am Andrew and I too pray with you. Always I am here and with you in prayer. For it is important that humanity comes to God and seeks the blessings of God. For how else will the deep healing of this world take place than with the intentions and efforts of each individual to seek to change, to be healed and transformed in the Grace of God, in His Love. So it will come and change you all and bring deep peace to the world.

God bless you beloveds. My love is with you, my prayers are with you. God bless you.
