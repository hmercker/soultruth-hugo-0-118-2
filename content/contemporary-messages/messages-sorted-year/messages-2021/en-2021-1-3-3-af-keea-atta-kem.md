God bless you, dear souls, I am Keea. You desire a transformation of your soul, and I am here to say that this is well underway. For it is by the Grace and the workings of the Divine Essence, the very substance of the Creator that lives in your soul, that changes you, causes the transformation, brings a great awakening and strength to your soul, and profound change. This is underway in each and every one of you. You recognize this change where, if you were to look back on the year that you have all come through, from the beginning until now, and observe and reflect upon how the Divine Essence has brought forth harmony into your daily existence, helping change your perspectives, broadening your views, opening your mind to greater possibilities, it is then easier for you to observe the permanent change that has occurred. If you continue to draw this Divine Essence into your soul, its workings will continue to perpetuate further change.

When the mind resists change, it hinders the soul’s ability to express itself in your life. It is as if you inhibit the soul from exercising itself in a way that brings forth Truth and harmony, and has the ability to inform your choices in both your thoughts and actions.

We are working with each of you to help you open your mind and guide you in your thought patterns, these reflexive responses, whether inwardly holding judgment towards oneself, towards others, or situations.  This part of you is what inhibits the light of your soul from its expression, and there is a bondage around the soul. However, through the Essence of Divine Love, it aims to strengthen the soul and bring grace to your material mind, guiding you to take responsibility for your thoughts into loving action.  These workings will allow the opening of the soul in its expression in your life.  You will come to recognize your true essence, that being within you that holds your purpose, that is here on a mission for humanity, bringing peace, love, joy, acceptance, harmony, and loving support.

The dynamic of the soul in its expression contains all of these qualities.  And you can feel, to some degree, the desire within you.  Each time you exercise, allowing the presence and love that you hold within your soul an opportunity for expression, you are expressing harmony.  You are allowing love to flow.  You are allowing God to move through the essence of your soul up into your material mind and flow through your body.  

It is a beautiful thing to witness the harmonization of soul, mind and body.  For one aspect alone cannot express fully what you are here to do.  Your soul has been gifted a mind, and in its highest essence, the mind aligned with its soul, with the soul aligned with God, brings forth the purpose.  The importance of the body lies in the unfolding of its manifestation of purpose. So, with the soul informing the mind, the mind informing the body, these three aspects of you working together are beautiful to witness. As you continue on your journey, strengthening this ability, you will cultivate an alignment between your soul, mind, and body.  There will be great ease in your life. Life is simplified, yet in these simple actions, there are profound outcomes.  For the soul aligned with God is within God’s Will. Mind aligned with soul is in God’s Will, and body aligned is within God’s Will.  The manifestation of God’s Will comes through you in a full and profound experience.  This is developing within every one of you, and be assured that exactly where you are at this point is where you need to be. There is no rush, but there is a need to prioritize. There is a need to align and focus. Having all these aspects come together allows the Will of God to flow through you, bringing forth the manifestation of your purpose. There is much potential, and as your purpose begins to show itself through your soul by the Grace of God, many potentials and opportunities will come before you. Through Grace, courage, and the strength of your soul, your life and its expression become one of light and joy. So, dear friends, this is the transformation that you all desire, and you all are in the midst of, for it cannot be any other way. The Law of Divine Love works upon the soul, transforming that which is not in harmony into harmony. When your whole soul, mind and body are in harmony with God, life flows in miraculous ways.

Set your sights on your transformation, and we are here to serve you and help you. I am Keea Atta Kem. My love is with you, and may each one of you receive a mighty inflowing of God’s Essence as you enter the realm of the Divine Essence. God bless you.
