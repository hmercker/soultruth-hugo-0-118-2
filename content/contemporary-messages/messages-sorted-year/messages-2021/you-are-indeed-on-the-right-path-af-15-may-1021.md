Indeed there is a plan, beloveds. I am your teacher Augustine and as we have indicated, that your efforts will coalesce into a great stream of service and love for many in the world. There is nothing for you to concern yourself with in terms of allowing and nurturing that stream forward for we are firmly in charge of this outcome as God's Will is working here.

You need not worry, but merely play your part to accomplish those things which need to be done, to open those avenues of communication, and to be loving to all those who may come into the fold of your work for there are many who are waiting in the wings. Waiting for you to accomplish these tasks, waiting for you to declare yourselves and the service that you have to give in your dedication to God's Love and Truth. You will soon open the floodgates, the doors of service, and much will be manifest in each of your efforts. You feel a desire within your souls to serve and to bring this truth to many. You know the great need for humanity to awaken to the truth of God's Love, to shift the consciousness of each individual soul upon your world toward greater light and truth. Indeed this is a mammoth task that requires step-by-step perseverance, application and dedication as you continue to pray to receive God's Love to strengthen your souls, for it is of the utmost importance that you continue to go to God in prayer consistently and fervently in order to be prepared and strengthened for the work that is to come.

Indeed this work is tremendous and will be very taxing upon you all provided you are willing to walk this path of service and accept that God has many tasks for you to perform, many opportunities and doors opened for your instrumentality, your gifts, your capacity to teach, to heal, to comfort, to bring many together into a great family and circle of love and light. Beloved souls, you are indeed on the threshold of many things and you continue to be focused although I know at times you are weary, at times you find what is asked of you challenging and taxing. But I say to you that the rewards will be great and as you walk in faith and prayer, so you will receive all that you require in order to do the work that you need to do and respond to God's guidance so to see it clearly and to express it in love.

As these things come, so the path widens and you come to meet many souls upon that path and God will guide you forward upon it with the angels accompanying you always. When you are in need of inspiration, merely ask in prayer and it will come. Though you may have difficulties interpreting and understanding some of the guidance that comes, I tell you my beloved students, you will come to clarity and there will be no confusion, no cross purposes, no barriers to speak of. Rather a great flow, a great opening and a great coalescing of efforts and intentions, desires and soulful gifts will bring about a beautiful light, a beautiful outcome that will touch many souls. You are destined to walk this path, to be a part of this great journey of service, to be greatly attuned to God's Will and God's plan and so it shall be as you grow and expand in the great gift of God's Love. So it shall be, and you will know such a sense of fulfillment and joy in your service, your work and all that you do in the name of truth and love.

Beloved souls, continue upon your trajectory. Have faith that you are indeed upon the right path. Know that when the time is ripe, doors will open and opportunities will come to you as there will be such an outpouring of love from many towards you with an appreciation, acknowledgment and desire to continue to tread the path of truth and love in their lives. There are many who are eager in their souls. It is for you to awaken that eagerness, to be inspirations, to be examples, to be beautiful lights in the world. In this way many will find their way and will come to join you within this gathering momentum, this great path of many souls seeking to do God's Will, fulfilling God's plan. It will come in surges, in outpourings, in great inspiration and in a sense of wonderment as God continues to guide you forward.

May God bless you, beloved souls. May God bless you deeply for it is now more than ever that your prayers are needed, your efforts to be with God in preparation for the next steps of this great plan for the salvation of humanity. God bless you, I am your teacher Augustine. I continue to uphold you as do many angels. We are with you, beloved souls, fully with you in your efforts. Continue to seek your own soulâ€™s knowledge, wisdom, love and all will be well, beloved souls. God bless you.
