I am who many have called the Archangel Michael. I am known by many names. I say to you that even we who are involved with the workings of the universe will come to assist you in this crucial time of transformation. We do not concern ourselves with the daily affairs of men but indeed, all resources are called into action and engagement with this time that is fast approaching. 

You will be able to rely upon our services and our efforts to uplift humanity for it is not that we are immune to  feel love for you, for we do love you as we love all of Godâ€™s creation and all of the universe. It is that we have our place and our roles to fulfill and know that in the case of these conditions and situations that are forthcoming that we will walk with man and bring the powers vested within our beings for the upliftment and awakening of humanity and this world.

All are being called, beloved souls. All are being called. The clarion call of God is heard by all and there will be a response like none other. You will see and witness many miracles and blessings upon your world. Many of you will be instrumental in bringing these blessings forward. Be assured, my beloved and beautiful friends, children of God, that all that is required and necessary in the coming times to assure the awakening and survival of humanity will be given. God has decreed it so and so it shall be given without restriction and so it shall be given in great abundance.

God has involved all the powers of the universe to ensure that His plan will be successful and that the world will be transformed. Be assured, beloved souls. Be assured that this shall be the case, that you may trust in the Will of God and the actions of God, your Creator, our Creator for all that is forthcoming shall indeed be.

I proclaim this to your world; that the world shall be healed and awakened and that life shall be awakened in ways that have not been awakened in the past, that light shall be present in ways that have not been present in the past, that all shall come in the glory of God, the Most High and Wondrous Creator.
God bless you, beloved souls. I am Archangel Michael. I have not spoken through this instrument before but I come with this message. I urge you to bring this message into your hearts and your souls and your minds so that you may truly believe. God bless you. God bless you all.
