I am your brother and friend in the love of God. I am Yogananda. Dear brothers and sisters who have come to this circle of light to be in the peace and the safety of Godâ€™s embrace, allow your hearts to open, that God may open up your souls, to fill each one with the glory of His love, the radiance of His light and the peace beyond human understanding.  

When you give your heart to God you are blessed with the treasures of heaven. Often people live in fear of what they might lose, what they might have to give up, all these attachments and allurements that this world offers. And yet, when you become attached to God, those things that once drew you in, distracted you, occupied so much of your mind and troubled your heart, fall away. 

For you will one day discard this physical body and journey on in spirit in realms of light. The more you allow the blessing of God, His love, His light, His peace, the freer your heart and your soul will become. Imagine if only for a moment, to be free of earthly concerns, to be lifted into the Love of the Creator? For the world will surely break your heart and I say let it break it open that you will flood this world with love and empathy and compassion. For every soul is a precious child of the Heavenly Father. And though they may be hidden behind a wall of misunderstanding, let your love reach out that they may know they are loved. 

In this place, in this sanctuary, you can allow your concerns and your troubles, your prayers and requests to go to God and be lifted up in His Love. What a wonder it is that you come together! There are many watching over you and I wish to remind you as I often do, that when you call, we come. We will never abandon you. 

May each here and beyond this circle allow the embrace of our loving Creator and open up to His Love. All else will be given to you. May each soul be blessed and transformed in the Love of God. With all my love and the blessings of all here in the grace of the Almighty glorious loving Creator, I join you now in silent prayer. I am your brother and friend in the love of God and in Christ. I am Yogananda. May God bless you. Peace.
