Confucius received by Al Fike

I bring a blessing of healing for you, beloved souls, I am Confucius. Precious and beloveds each, precious souls here, a part of the great string of pearls, God's beautiful souls strung together with love. So you are blessed, beloveds, and blessed in this world for you have come and accepted this truth of God's Love into your hearts and souls. And you have come to God beseeching Him to transform you in Love. And so all the angels of Heaven are called upon by God to protect and nurture these precious souls upon the earth, those who are making great efforts to bring truth to themselves and to their lives, to bring truth to others. So you are precious to us, beloveds, very precious indeed.

May your great potentials of soul awaken and come to be known in the world as you desire to serve humanity in love. May all that God has implanted within you be awakened and expressed in all its beauty and glory and light. God bless you, beloveds, I am Confucius and I come to assure you how loved you all are, truly, truly loved, beloved souls, truly loved in the world.

God bless you, beloveds, God bless you. Peace be upon you, joy in your hearts, understanding and insight that comes from the soul, bubbling forth into your minds. Beloveds, beloveds, God bless you.
