I am here John. I am known as the Beloved. This was because I understood with my heart, and I allowed the Love to touch my soul. I also had visions but what became of my writings of those visions resulted in much of what I did not write, many interpolations, distortions and even imaginations. I was very close to not only to the Master and his dear mother Mariam as well, and this bond has remained all these many years.
 
Where I dwell it is always present for it is beyond time, as is the love of God. We dwell in Grace and so much beauty. Someday, in the not-too-distant future, you too will join us, beyond your worries, your physical concerns, in the perfection in beauty of the Kingdom of God’s love, the Celestial Heavens. 
  
May the love of God touch you, heal you, free you from concern, lift you up in joy, in light, and awaken your soul forevermore. Be at peace. You are loved, deeply loved. I am your brother in Christ, a redeemed soul who inhabits the Celestial heavens where we await your arrival beyond time and space and in God’s Grace where we are all One. Go in Peace. 
   
I am John. Go in Peace.
