May 18<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

...I am Seretta Kem. I come today to speak some words on your instrumentalities and the power and instrumentality of this circle which you have created together, in these consistent and earnest prayers together. God wishes to manifest His Blessings upon this Earth for the benefit of many of His children, and He eagerly awaits those of you who are in a heightened condition, a light, a development of the soul, where these blessings may manifest through you and help inspire your brothers and sisters who are seeking and yet, have great barriers to the Laws of Love and the alignment with God and His Love.

You are the resolute examples and expressions of this Law, the power of love within the soul manifest through you. Depending upon your level of progression, so the power of these blessings flow forth through you. It is our hope that one day, we too may manifest through you, that those upon the earth plane may be able to see us and hear us and recognize that indeed what to them is a miracle, but in truth is just the exercise of the laws of spirit and the material plane put together in such a way that these manifestations may take place.

There is much that can be accomplished through you who are dedicated souls who continue to pray for the development of your soul and the alignment of your soul with God. In your efforts daily and together in these times during the week, you inch towards these possibilities so that they may be manifest through you. Some of you are continuing to entertain the idea and the practice of creating what we call Direct Voice, and I say to you that the angels are with you in this and that a great deal may be accomplished in your dedications and prayers for this gift to manifest.

Much is happening now amongst you, encouraging and guiding and supporting you in this work which we have all band together in loving dedication and desire to bring greater light to this world, to bring the truth that God loves all His children, and that Love is a real and palpable expression of His Soul conveyed to another soul.

We beseech you to continue to seek for the highest and to express the highest in your lives. Do not compromise with those things that are tainted by the human condition and by the mindful conditions of those who would project and imagine certain truths which are in fact half-truths and distortions of truth. It is important that you test for yourselves what truth truly is, and within you and your prayers and your soul perceptions there will come an acknowledgment, an experience, an awakening to truth in such a way that you will not falter nor be confused by what is truly God's manifestations and creations in your world, the truth of Godâ€™s universe acknowledged and known within your soul. In this way you do yourselves a great service in your ambitions and desires to serve God and to serve humanity.

It is that journey of the soul awakened and in alignment with God that will bring you to that place of true service, clear and pure, loving and bright, in the world. For, each of you has this great potential, beloved souls, each of you is capable of doing wondrous things for God and for God to manifest wondrous blessings through you. There is much yet for you to discover, every one of you here and the many more who are a part of your groups, for God has such a kaleidoscope, such a wonderment of truth, of blessings, of gifts and experiences to give to each one of you on your journeys as you walk this Divine Path. So much will be revealed, provided you are open to this, not so much within your mind but indeed your mind plays a part, but within your soul and the great power of your faith in God that allows God and permits God to bless you and to enlighten you.

So much comes through a simple prayer, a prayer that is earnest and deep and abiding to the laws of love, the laws of God's blessings to each soul, and those laws are obeyed in prayer. It is not difficult nor complicated, it is merely a dedication, a trust, a faith, a belief that God will truly bless you, and so He will. As you walk the Path of Truth and Love, so He will, and all will come in great waves and revelations, truth and knowings, as God envelops you with His Love, uplifts you with His Touch and brings you into alignment, both mind and soul, with His Great Soul. So it shall be as you walk this beautiful path flanked by angels, protected, enlivened and enlightened. As your soul grows in the blessings of His Love, so your faculties that lie deep within you will awaken and come alive, and in this you will know a great joy, a deep and abiding joy, and a knowing that will be unshakable, and the capacity to share with your brothers and sisters, blessings and truths, love and light, that all souls upon your Earth long for, yet know not what they long for. You will show them the way, beloved souls, truly show them the way upon this beautiful path, sharing your experiences, your love, your insights, your instrumentalities and gifts for the benefit of all who are willing and eager to partake in the great and wondrous blessing of God's Love.

God bless you my friends, I am Seretta Kem. You will all find your way and find your gifts and find the expressions of these gifts in all the uniqueness and beauty that exists within your soul. Open, open wide and drink deep of these Waters of Love, and so all will manifest and be a powerful expression and example for others. God bless you. God bless you. Your friend, Seretta Kem, always by your side, continuing to assist you in your development and the opening of all good and wondrous parts of yourself which are in alignment with your soul and with God. God bless you. God bless you beloveds.
