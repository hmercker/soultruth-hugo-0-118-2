There is such a condition of deprivation in your world that it requires all of your efforts and prayers and the efforts of many more to bring the blessings of God down to your Earth, to comfort the many souls who are feeling alone, fearful, confused, and in darkness. Though you may pass by someone with a smiling face, often underneath that smile is a sense of isolation and disillusionment, for the vast majority of humanity upon your Earth do not know their own souls. They have a sense of being in the world which is dominated by the mind and some sense of that greater part of themselves flickering in a corner somewhat recognized but certainly not fully understood.

Now is the time on your Earth plane where humanity must come to recognize its true selves, must come to sensitize themselves to all that is within them and around them for those surface experiences and recollections of life are not in any measure giving the individual a complete picture of life. It is time for a deeper sensibility to take hold and to be a force within them that motivates and awakens them to greater truth and understanding of what life truly is.

Until this can be in your world, until humanity awakens to something deeper, this terrible deprivation of the human condition will continue and continue to proliferate. This is why it is important for all of you to continue to pray, to open up your sensibilities, your soul, so that you may see beyond the superficiality of the mind’s illusions and senses to that of a soul knowing and seeing from that deeper place. Indeed, there is a great hunger out there in the world, a hunger of the soul seeking love and validation, seeking God, seeking one another in a true and powerful connection. This is what is needed, for without satiating this hunger, it will only lead to further darkened conditions and deprivations for the mind is lost in its distorted view of the world. The mind needs to be educated by the soul and by God.

Allow this education to take place within you. Allow yourselves to feel deeply, to know with a piercing gaze and an intuitive understanding that comes from the soul. In this way, you will be able to be guided and directed upon a journey that will bring you to many other souls, that will satisfy the deep longing within you and infill this hollowness that so many feel in your world. Seek the Love of God above all else. Seek to love your brothers and sisters. Seek to love yourself. Make love the overriding power of your life, that which informs everything so that you may be guided in the ways of light, in the ways of serving your brothers and sisters and be free from these shackles that humanity has built, one to another, surrounding this Earth in a great pall of being and feeling lost in the world.

There is so much to gain in your efforts as you reach out for God. As you gain in strength, so you will be a channel of love and light in the world. You will see through the illusions, the errors, the darkness. Your consciousness will light up with the consciousness of the soul and thereby being a fount of wisdom, of strength, of love for your brothers and sisters. The world is in need of enlightened souls. May you come to that place. Feel the impetus and the blessing of God guiding you forward. There you will assist the world to acclaim itself and be in greater harmony with God’s Laws of Creation, with what is meant to be in the world.

May God bless you on that journey, beloveds. I am Andrew. I am happy to be with you today in prayer, to pray for this world of yours for it is in such need of prayer, of love, of light, of wisdom and truth. God will provide these things to those who are open and willing to receive. So, it shall be given in abundance, in waves and powerful blessings upon humanity. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. I am with you all in your prayers. God bless you.
