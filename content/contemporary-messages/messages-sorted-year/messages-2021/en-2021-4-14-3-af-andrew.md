# Have your Soul nourished

April 14<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Vancouver Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Andrew received by Al Fike

The breath of God's is upon you, my beloved brothers and sisters. I am Andrew. I come to pray with you today to have my soul nourished as you seek to have your soul nourished. For as we pray together so this great gift from God, this bounty of His Love flows forth upon us all. And so we walk together brothers and sisters, a family of love in the Light of God's Touch and breath upon us. And we exercise the faith of our souls in prayer to receive this great gift that is God's Essence upon our souls. In this we are healed and uplifted, gathered together in Light, and bring the awakening and knowing that we are truly connected and a part of this great Lattice of Light that continues to grow and be strengthened by our prayers, by our intentions, by our actions in service to God.

May we continue to be God's servants that God may open the doors for service and Love to flow through each one of us, that we may truly be aligned with God's great Soul and come to be in harmony within our own soul, brought about by the gift of God's Love which lifts us ever higher into the Light, into the Light, beloveds, we walk together into the Light.

May God bless you, beloveds, and keep you in His loving embrace and show you the way to at-onement, the bliss and joy of this great merging and awakening that is your soul to God. God bless you, beloved souls, I am Andrew. I am with you always, God's servants, God's bringers of Light, God's beloved children upon this journey of true soul awakening and blessings. God bless you. I am with you and I love you dearly, your brother, your friend who walks with you upon the great path of Love. God bless you.
