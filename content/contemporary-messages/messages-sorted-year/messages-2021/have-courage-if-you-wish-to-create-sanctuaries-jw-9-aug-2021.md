I am your brother in God’s Love, may it be upon you. You have a great opportunity to create a spiritual community that will withstand the test of time, because you have based your path on the eternal principal of love from the Heavenly Father. Empires come and go. This is the way of the world. That which is not built on a firm foundation will eventually dissipate. 

The inventions of humankind have given the world much promise and yet the actions of the powerful have prevented the possibility of peace on earth. So, you come together in these beautiful circles of light, lifting your hearts and allowing our Beloved Creator to fill your souls. The emanations of His Love truly reach out around the earth and connect in light to the Celestial Heavens. Do not lose hope. Let this love in your souls bring faith that you may act from your souls and the light therein beyond fear. Much has been given you and much is required from you. 

You know the saying of dear Gandhiji, which is now quite popular around the world “be the change you wish to see in the world.” I met Gandhiji while I was on earth and I had never seen such powerful conviction in an individual, so focused on remaining peaceful and bringing about a transition of power in my country. And yet his life was cut short by a religious zealot. So, it is vitally important to bring the peace of God’s Love out into the world from these beautiful circles. 

Some of you know, but many of you may not know, how much light and Divine Love you have received and carry out into the world. Those who wish to form places of refuge, sanctuaries, sustainable spiritual havens for your children and your children’s children, those of us here, encourage you. Encourage being the word because the word courage is key, and courage is required. This courage comes from your faith and from the knowing in your soul that there is no death and that your future is glorious. So, while on earth do what you can, each one in their own way to bring peace, sustainability, healing, good health, and above all the truth of God’s love, to this world. May His love bless each one in this circle and beyond and may this community of Divine Love ever grow more abundantly to embrace the earth that all may see you as an outward sign of Grace. 

With all my love and blessings, I thank you. I am your brother and eternal friend in Christ. I am Yogananda. God bless you.
