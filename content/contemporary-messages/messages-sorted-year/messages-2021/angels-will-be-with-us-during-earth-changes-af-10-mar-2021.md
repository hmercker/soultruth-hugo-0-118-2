# Angels Will be with us During Earth Changes

March 10<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Gibsons, B.C. Canada Vancouver Prayer Circle

Received by Al Fike


May God’s Love enter your souls that you may receive this gift in great abundance. I am your teacher Augustine. I come to assure you that no matter what the circumstances, no matter what may happen on your Earth plane, we will continue to forge our relationship with you and be there by your side, provided you continue to seek the highest gift, the gift of the Father's Love, for your own. 

I think back to the origins of this group that came to be so many years ago, in all its permutations, with all the collections of individuals who have come together in Circles of Light for all these years, and there are many; almost 70 years to be precise. (1950's) There have been many prayers for Divine Love in these Circles of Light in this city upon the globe. There are not many cities that have this distinction and have carried on somewhat consistently with the effort to continue to pray for the great gift of God's Love, and to come together to hear our words, to commune with those from the Celestial Heavens who continue to be with you. 

Together we bring a blessing to this world. Together we are united in a gift of Love for this world, brought about by your prayers and our prayers, brought about because of the power of the unity, a singleness of purpose that has been with you for all of these decades. So we will continue, beloved souls, for many years to come. We will continue to gather in this way to bring this Circle of Light into the Light, into the Grace of God and receive these blessings. This we promise you, and in this we continue to abide by our commitment, our desire to nurture you, to help to teach you, to inspire you to look heavenward, to look to your Heavenly Father and receive His great blessings. For this is the key to your salvation. This is the key to the healing of your world. This is what will make a soul awakened and come to know itself, and to express itself in all its beauty and glory and wonderment. A soul beloveds, a soul is what God loves. It is your soul, and His Love for your soul is deep and abiding and will never leave you, never leave you. 

Many will find their way to these Circles of Light as you continue to proliferate, to make efforts, consistent and powerful efforts to bring the great gift and Truth of God’s Love into the midst of your brothers and sisters, that they may come to know this gift, that they may come to see and recognize the yearnings of their own soul, to receive what God has to give to them, to open themselves even when they are vulnerable, even when this is difficult, even when they must face the multitude of barriers that come within habitations upon this earthly plane. 

The dear souls continue to seek this gift, to come to be healed, to be awakened and loved. This shall be forevermore upon your world. This Truth shall not be lost, it shall gain momentum as each successive generation finds their way to God and commits themselves to discovering the great gift that God has to give to them. So you will come to pass this torch of truth to others who will pass to others, and in time, the world will know of this great gift. The world will then have the opportunity to make the choice. Each individual soul will come to know that there is indeed a choice and that they may choose at-onement with God and God will fulfill that desire and commitment to be in alignment with the Great Oversoul, the Heavenly Father, the Source of all Love. It comes with a simple prayer, and indeed you fulfill this edict, this promise, this truth, by your prayers and desires to be with God and to receive His Love.

May God bless you on that journey. May we continue, beloved and beautiful souls, we in the Celestial Heavens, you upon the Earth, and all the spirits in between and therein in the spiritual realms will come to know this gift, will come to see the light and will come to be blessed, because they recognize and have come to understand this truth. God bless you beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine and I am with you in your prayers, as are many. God bless you. God bless you beloveds.
