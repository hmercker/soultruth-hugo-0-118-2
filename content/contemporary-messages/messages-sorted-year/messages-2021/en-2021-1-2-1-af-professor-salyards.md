Lightbringers, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

Oh my beautiful friends, if you could only spend a day in heaven and understand those things which we speak of.  I am Professor Salyards, and I know you have your challenges living in this earth plane. We understand, for we too were challenged by those conditions that are so prevalent in your world.

Do not feel frustration or inadequacy or a sense that you must do this all perfectly and perfectly in alignment with God's Will, for we understand this is not a possibility. But we encourage you, my friends, to strain yourselves, reaching for God and coming into that alignment that is so needed within you and with all of humanity. In this alignment, the teachings, what must come through you and touch many souls, will be clear and powerful and beautiful. It is coming. Allow yourselves love, patience and persistence. Be with God as much as you can. Pray and pray some more and all will unfold in glorious and beautiful, loving expressions.

May God bless you, my beautiful friends. I am your servant, your teacher, your loving supporter. Your own Professor Salyards is with you. God bless you.
