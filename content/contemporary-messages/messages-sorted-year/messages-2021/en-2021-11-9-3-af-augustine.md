# Service in Love is the Highest Road

November 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

May God bless you deeply, my beloved and beautiful students, I am your teacher, Augustine. For those who aspire towards greater light, often their foundation of spirituality rests upon the deeds of charity and goodness and service to humanity. That many who are deeply religious, as you would call them, feel that their faith is exercised in the good deeds towards others, in their moral thoughts and behaviors and all things that are sanctioned by religious teachings. In many regards, they do indeed increase their own light and bring light to the world through these deeds, provided they are pure in intention and loving.

I think you would be surprised to hear that these deeds in themselves, will not awaken the soul. These acts of kindness and charity in the world are an expression of a mind that is focused upon doing such acts and deeds for the benefit of others. Indeed, this is a blessing and a beautiful expression of the individual in the world. But indeed, the soul is not particularly touched by these acts and deeds. The soul needs something more substantial and beneficial in order for it to awaken to any degree. And that, as you well know, is the blessing that is the Divine Love, to receive this gift from God, to awaken the soul.

Now, the mind that is in a condition that is of light and that condition is reinforced by service to others, may indeed be receptive to the blessing of Divine Love. For, in this heightened condition of the mind there can often be an opening, a realization, an awareness, of that deep part of the individual, which is the soul. If these acts of kindness are followed up by prayer and desire to serve God, then there is often an opening, a blessing that is given. Unfortunately, many of the concepts and ideas of what is called the Christian religion are focused upon the mind's mindful considerations and actions that are deemed good and wholesome, with the suggestion that God approves and will bless the righteous and those that are in goodness.

Often however, many enact these deeds and kindnesses out of fear or out of a desire to be recognized, and their intentions are not as pure as you may think. For in many regards, the Christian religion leans heavily on edicts and “thou shalts” in order to motivate individuals to act accordingly. There is a large component of guilt, a great impetus to control and often, manipulate the individual so that their actions, their thoughts and their efforts are directed in certain ways so to reinforce the beliefs and structures of the church.

You, my beloved and beautiful students, are not subject to these conditions and these expectations. Rather, we urge you to pray for the inflowing of the Father's Love into your souls, to do so earnestly, that your desires are in alignment with this truth, and that in this alignment and in the blessing of this truth, this Love inflowing into your souls, so there is a desire to serve in love, to serve your brothers and sisters in many ways. Indeed, these ways are not so different from your brothers and sisters who are in service for their church and for the congregations of their church or for others who are in need. But the component of love that you carry within your soul, provided it is expressed freely through you, and clearly, has a deeper impact upon the individual. whom you are serving. And you are more receptive to being guided by God and the angels in this service. It is a more direct, powerful, and clear expression of love in the world.

I do not mean to denigrate your brothers and sisters who are blinkered by their ideas and concepts of loving service, often predicated in judgment and as I say, fear. Indeed, they are making efforts, they are trying to bring light, to be loving, to express God’s Will. But they are at a great disadvantage because they are not attuned to their souls in the way that you are attuned your soul. You walk a higher road, beloved souls. I do not mean to say that you are superior to your brothers and sisters, but there is a greater clarity and light that comes as you are in service to God through your soul awakening. The quality of the service, the quality of love expressed, the quality of the light, the power of what may come through you for others as God’s servant, is different from those mindful acts and obligations that come with the preachings and teachings of those on the pulpit.

Beloved souls, you are free of these things, and I'm sure you are grateful that your life is much simplified and has a clarity and a joy within that many, many upon your Earth do not experience. May you walk with a spring in your step, a joy in your heart, a beautiful desire and intention to be loving channels in the world. In this way, often you do not have to go out of your way to serve others, instead, God brings the opportunities to you and those opportunities become self-evident. What you may do in response to those opportunities is determined by the understanding and intuition of your soul seeking to serve God. That expression may be simple indeed, or it may involve a series of steps and events that will help uplift and bring that individual into greater light.

You will not know what God brings forth in a day until you are willing to step forward into that day with a desire to serve, with an effort to bring love and light, often in a silent and simple way, and at times, with words of wisdom and love and reassurance to your brothers and sisters. Whatever may transpire in a day may indeed be informed by God's Will and desire for you to act as His servant. And as you grow in the Father's Love, so you will hear God's Will and know God's Will in a definitive and clear way. In this, life becomes simplified and more direct in its expression of life, love, service, gratitude, joy. Much will come your way. My beloved and beautiful students.

As you continue upon this path, God will bring many souls to you. God will open many doors for you. God will provide the ways and the means to serve in a variety of ways. Be a light with every day. Ask God to guide you with every day, and ask God that you may be His servant. As you continue to pray and grow in the Father's Love, so that expression of service, that beautiful light of your soul will shine forth with greater clarity and power, beauty and grace. Love will abound in your life; beautiful and pure love expressed in a myriad of ways.

May you have a strong faith within you, a strong sense of purpose, a clarity of direction, a true understanding of God's Will in your life. In this way, much will unfold and you will understand fully, what it is to be God's servants, to walk the path of light, truth and love, without the expressions and projections of the human psyche and mind towards certain expectations and directions which must be followed in accordance to these edicts. You are free, beloved souls, free to serve, free to love, free to be your true selves, and may you find your way into greater freedom. greater light, greater love.

Beloved students, I am your teacher, Augustine.  I come to speak and pray and be with my beloved charges, who are lights in the world, beautiful lights, souls shining bright. May you continue to do so. With all of my love, I am with you. God bless you.
