# My New Home and Life in Spirit 

January 20<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike


May the Father bless you with His Love. I am Barbara.<sup>1</sup> I come to be with you and tell you, my beloved friends, that I am close to you often, that really in essence I have never left your side, but in my prayers and thoughts and all that I am, know that my love is with you, that for every moment of every day that the love bond between us is never broken, but is full and rich and we all carry this beautiful bond together.

I want you to know how happy I am as I have entered my new home in the spirit world. And I want to say that all the descriptions and anecdotes that are given regarding these places are a shadow of what really is. To use a phrase that I was often happy to use, it is mind-blowing. You cannot imagine how beautiful it is.

When I look back at my life and some of my struggles and indeed at times, a great loneliness because of my perceptions and gifts, it was all worth the effort. It was all worth the pain, because now I have received a great reward. And there are more rewards to come, I know. 

But for this time, I am settled in such a beautiful place, such a beautiful home with lovely gardens, and yes, all of my beloved pets are with me. Those souls whom I met in the Earth plane and have a bond with are here, so we come together and pray as you do, and many more, many new friends have I met. And how at home I feel to be comfortable in this environment, an environment that is in harmony with my true soul’s nature and all the gifts that I have of perception are commonplace where I live. So I am truly home and I know that I will continue to progress up that ladder of light to greater light and ever greater light as I continue to pray for God’s Love and as I continue to grow in God’s Love. 

There is always more to know. There is always more to come. And God is always blessing us, provided we are open and willing to receive. My friends, be aware that all the efforts that you make today will bring its rewards tomorrow. There is nothing to fear. I realize this now. There is nothing to fear, but God has you firmly in His grasp, carries you upward in light, blesses and protects you and does so with all who are in that frame of mind and soul to be with God, to be in that place of great faith and desire and love. 

The bliss of God’s Touch is but a breath away, my friends. The beauty of God’s Creation is awesome in scope and nature and we are all blessed to be on this journey together. Know that I walk upon this journey with you. And if you could but see all the beautiful souls, all the beautiful angels who are walking with you, who are there to uplift you and support you, who are doing God’s bidding for you, to bring light around you, to protect you from all darkness, to bring to you inspiration, to help you in your desires and prayers for growth and upliftment. Oh, how you would be awestruck in this perception and knowledge of the many angels and beautiful spirits who are working together to uplift humanity. 

You are very blessed, my friends. I was very blessed and so are you, to know this truth, to really know this truth so you may utilize it daily, that you may express love daily, that you may help others who are downtrodden, in the darkness, desperate and in great need for love. These things you can give to another. These things are important to recognize in the world. For if you do not uplift the very lowest, how can you uplift all of humanity? It is important that you walk in the light and express the light, to have great compassion for others. Put aside your judgments and your fears and be in the Grace of God’s Love. You will find yourself there, truly find who you are, what your gifts are, how you can walk in light, freely and know the joy of God’s Touch upon your soul.

How loved you are, my friends. How beautiful you are. And I know many of you struggle like I struggled, though your struggles may be unique. Still, all is worth the effort, all is a great gift to the soul, and you will find your way. I promise you, you will find your way. The rewards are great. The light is great. God’s Love for you is great. And all of this will come together to uplift you, to change you, to heal you and bring great peace and love to you. 

My love is with you. I am happy to be a part of this circle. And my dear and beloved sister, how dedicated you are to help others. And my love and assistance and appreciation for who you are continues to grow. As I observe you from my side of life, so I see more deeply, more profoundly, the beauty of your soul. So it is from this place in which I reside, when I come to Earth and I am drawn to those in light, I have come to appreciate so much more the efforts and struggles and journeys that you all take to find God. And my prayers and my love are with you all as you continue on this journey of love. 

May God bless you with His Love, this beautiful Peace, the beautiful Touch from God. It is for all of you. It is for all of humanity. Continue to pray that humanity will be touched by God, deeply, profoundly so. God bless you, my friends. Know that I am close, closer than you think, and will continue to help you be uplifted in love. God bless you, my friends. I am Barbara. I love you. God bless you all.

**Note 1** Barbara Davies, known to all as Barb, was a very long time mainstay of the Divine Love movement in Vancouver and a mentor to the medium, Al Fike for most of his life. 

Barb first mentored Al as a 22 year old. Barb began hosting Divine Love prayer circles in her West Vancouver home probably in the late 1970's or early 1980's which carried on until 2020 when that home was sold after her passing, but her spirit lives on through Terry Adler who continues to host these prayer sessions. 

Al Fike received additional information at the time of this message from Barb which is now shared below:

**Al’s conversation with Barbara after the prayer 01-20-2021**

She told me after she spoke, that she wants me to write her story though dictation. I will give that a try, see how it goes. But she said, *“Oh no, in spirit, we don’t have kitchens or bathrooms or bedrooms. It is kind of one big room”*, although she said there is a dining table where we sit around and eat these fruits with water, beautiful water that is there. And we talk, we have conversations. 

She said she has all of her beautiful objects there, the native art and all that Is there. And she said it doesn’t look cluttered or look out of place. It is all in harmony there. And she said, the animals, she was naming them off, her pets, the ones that I know of anyway. There are a lot, probably 50 different pets she has had over the years. They are all there and everyone gets along, it’s fine. She said she goes for walks and all the pets follow her as she walks down the road. 

People actually have great deference for her because there aren’t many who were greeted by Jesus on their passing and it is well known there that she had that in passing. She said: *“When I passed, there were 1000’s of people there and I felt like I knew everybody. And she said, there were some that I helped, the homeless that I helped that had passed. They weren’t in very good shape, they weren’t light-filled.”* 

All the exalted angels were there, and she said it was a whole group of people and everything in between and she was kind of overwhelmed by it. And Jesus was kind of leading her up this incline, up to where she was going to go in spirit, and there were people all along the road, as if a queen was visiting. It was pretty amazing. 

She gave me a lot of information there, just beautiful. She looked lovely and radiant, beautiful. The scene behind Florence (Florence’s Zoom background, a photo of a small garden potting shed surrounded by rose bushes) is similar to Barb’s little house, not large, but beautiful.
