# We Are Awakening!

September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Direct Voice, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Andrew received by Al Fike

We are all deeply blessed with your guides and presences in our lives. They have been especially selected to ignite your gifts that will help in the awakening process, this transformation that is taking place. Together we are generating a great force and catalyst that is awakening many things within us, uniting us, and opening our perceptions, and our true sense of self.

This has never been done before in the way it is being done today and together. We are as much an experiment as we are a group deeply blessed. Indeed, what has been accomplished to date has been well worth our efforts and yours. We are awakening. We are awakening. Yes, it may feel a slow process to some, but indeed, it is happening in a way that is in harmony with your particular personality and needs, and that we all need to be patient in this process and trust in it. Some will have powerful experiences. Some will come to see things that are extraordinary. But all of you will come away from this experience changed deeply. But I warn you that you can revert back to your old life quite readily if you allow it to be. You may slip back into the old and familiar ways.

What is being given here is an opportunity to truly change and to be that beautiful soul that you are in ways that you are meant to be. It does not mean that you will change your personality, that something fundamental will be lost. No, my friends. It means that you will come to know yourself more fully and express yourself with greater clarity and at a higher level of awareness and expression and light and love that will bless and benefit many, many souls.

Do not underestimate the power of the soul that God has implanted within you. Do not underestimate the multiplicity of gifts that reside within each soul. Remember that each soul is unique, that each journey is unique, and that we all walk hand-in-hand. Yet, you are not lost in this commingling together, rather, we are strengthening one another, awakening one another, and honouring one another for their unique selves.

God bless you. I am Andrew, I too am a part of this effort as I am the one who has journeyed with this soul for many years. God bless you. God bless you all, beloved souls.
