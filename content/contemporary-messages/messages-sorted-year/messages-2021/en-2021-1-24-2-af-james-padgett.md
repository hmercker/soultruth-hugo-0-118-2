# Encourages a Planning Group for Padgett Messages

James Padgett Study Group, Gibsons, BC, Canada

James Padgett received by Al Fike

Blessings to you my friends, I am James Padgett. I have certainly been with you during your conversations and heartily approve of your approach and your dedication to bring the Truth of Divine Love to humanity. When I did my work which was led by our beloved brother Jesus, they were different times indeed. In those times, book reading was a major past-time. Spiritualism was of great interest. The world lived in a slower pace and there was a great deal of opportunity to communicate, to talk to one another, to consider many subjects. Now your times are very different indeed, and the intent of individuals to take a substantial portion of time to read a book, to have long discussions about deep matters, is rare. 

So you are faced with quite a challenge here. A challenge to reach the hearts and imaginations of your brothers and sisters who live upon a world that is full and replete with many distractions, mechanisms, ways in which they are receiving tidbits of information. So their minds, their brains are used to this flow of information which is often incomplete but very concise at the same time. For you to reach these individuals, you must tailor your message in accordance to what others are used to and are a part of in the flow of information that comes in your world these days.

So I would suggest that you not take full messages and read them and study them. Rather, take portions, the most important portions, and speak of these things. Ask your brothers and sisters for their thoughts and opinions regarding these matters. It is important that you excite the imaginations of those who are part of these groups. This is more important than insisting on setting forth concise and complex information which is often soon forgotten by those who are not used to such a way of study.

You are not enrolling others in what you might consider advanced studies, rather, these are rudimentary in nature and require simple, direct and concise sharing. There are many elements within what you call the Padgett materials which you may extract and share that will indeed excite the imagination of others. I would encourage you to do so. In time my hope, and I'm sure it is with yourselves, is that they will be inspired to read these volumes and study them. But this is for you an opportunity to render down the knowledge that you know, expressed in conjunction with the experiences that you have had upon your journey of Divine Love and make a narrative that is understandable, simple and inspiring.

Indeed, there are many gifts amongst you and many possibilities of presenting things in imaginative ways. So, I would encourage you to consider this and to be in harmony with one another, setting forth your goals that are not in essence lofty, but simple and humble. In this way you will find that many will feel comfortable in expressing their own ideas and will find what you have to share to be interesting and appealing to their minds and their souls. What more can you do my friends, than to bring another soul to God, to show that individual that these things are real, tangible and are useful for oneâ€™s spiritual journey, to reach towards the highest, the greatest blessings for the soul? Even if these individuals do not acquire the information mentally that you have to share, certainly you have sown seeds within the soul of each individual you encounter. Even if it is for one meeting, you will have sown that seed and done your work. For is this not God's work my friends, to be a channel of Love and Truth in the world?

You will find your way. It is not difficult and it does not require great strain and stress and worry, merely faith and a joyful commitment to reach out to the souls that God will put in your path and bring to them the most valuable and highest Truth that can be brought to any individual upon their journey. Awakening spiritually, mentally, soulfully; these things come. You will be inspired my friends, and you will have joy upon this journey.
 
May God bless you on this journey. I will be with you, inspiring you and indeed, with our dear brother who participates I will speak through him to give some of my anecdotal information and to add to the story of my journey and the story of the journey of Truth given to humanity in such unique and creative ways. God bless you my friends, I am James Padgett. My love is with you. God bless you.
