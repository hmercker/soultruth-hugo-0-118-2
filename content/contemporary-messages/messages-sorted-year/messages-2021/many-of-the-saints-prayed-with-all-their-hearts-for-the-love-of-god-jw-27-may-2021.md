# Many of the Saints Prayed with all their Hearts for the Love of God

I am here your brother and friend and humble servant in the love of God. I am Yogananda. Our dear brother James Padgett has allowed me to step forward today. 

I should like to begin by saying that I was not aware of what James Padgett received during my time on earth, but I am now. I have read many of the messages he received, and I also visit these groups in the Divine Love community. Even though the Divine Love is available in every tradition, James Padgett was the first to clarify the difference between the natural love and the love of the Creator. 

If you were to read the lives of the saints, in the Catholic tradition for instance, you would find that many of them, though they believed in the traditional dogma of the church such as the vicarious atonement, the trinity, the virgin birth and so forth, all of which are in error, yet so many of these saints prayed with all their heart with all their souls for the love of God and they transcended those beliefs as did many of the Hindu gurus, Jewish rabbis, Sufi Muslims. 

If you read between the lines, you can find this longing for the Creator’s love in the writings of all that I am referring to. So while the Divine love truths and teaching is not limited to any group, the Padgett messages are the most comprehensive and beautiful expose of the truths that the Master Jesus wished the world to have in declaring the difference between the two loves, a topic which you have explored today, and may I say, quite beautifully. 

There is much more to be discovered on your journey to the Celestial heavens but one essential truth that supersedes all others is to pray with sincerity, with all your heart, with all your soul, to receive the love of your Creator. This my dear ones, is the transformation of the soul from the mere image, the mortal condition, to rebirth as a Celestial angel. This is your destiny should you wish it to be so. 

I thank James for letting me speak today, for this one taking my message. It is my honor and privilege to be your brother in the love of God. All of us here wish you every good and perfect gift from the fountainhead of God’s love. May it be yours. I love you. I am Yogananda. May God bless you.
