Direct Voice, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Beloved and beautiful friends, I am Seretta Kem. For all of you who are insistent and desiring to come to be a part of this Circle of Light in the flesh, I say to you that all barriers will be dissolved in prayer, that you must indeed beseech God to remove those barriers and to open the way for your journeys to this designated place for the development of this gift of Direct Voice.

We continue to be with you as we have promised, each of you have with you a retinue of spirits who are continuing to work with you. Indeed, there are adjustments that each of you must make in order to further align yourself with this goal and purpose . Development is beginning. As you continue to pray and be open to the process of this development of the gift required, I say, please pray diligently. Please continue to follow your heart’s and your soul’s guidance. Please guard your thoughts. Do not allow negativity to enter therein, especially in regard to these efforts for negative forces will indeed find cracks and fissures within your thinking and your emotions and try to drive wedges into those cracks so that you feel uncertain and possibly fearful.

This is also a test of faith. Faith that this will be the case, that you will indeed step forward in this great arena. Know that God will indeed dissolve the barriers in your way for each of you have responsibilities. Each of you reside within a unique condition and situation that requires some effort to bring into alignment with this purpose. Be strong in your faith. Be loving toward yourself. Do not let ideas and thoughts that say you are unworthy or incapable to come and be a part of this great Circle of Light for these things of the mind are irrelevant.

I urge you to put aside any such thoughts. When these thoughts arise, say a prayer, beloved souls. Say a prayer to God. Ask Him to remove these thoughts from you. Ask Him to increase your faith through receiving His great gift of Divine Love. Ask Him to wash you clean of all conditions that are not in harmony with love, to truly be His instruments, clear channels in the world.

When you set your desires upon such a course, when you open the avenues and channels to express your soul as God’s instruments in the world, so the way opens and much can be accomplished through you because you have nurtured an attitude within your mind and a condition of faith within your soul that allows for a clear channel of light and love and God’s Will and intention manifest through you.

There is so much that you can do with every day that is given to you as a gift. As you align yourself with the opportunities and possibilities that God places before you in any particular day, so you come closer to the true goal which is to be God’s true channels of love and light in the world. The Direct Voice gift is just one manifestation of this. I dare say this is not the most important aspect of your instrumentality. Rather, it is that daily pursuit, expressing love in all that you do, being God’s channel for the moment to bless many.

These things lead to the fulfilment and opening of other gifts such as Direct Voice. It is the laying of such a crucial foundation and it is in not delaying your thoughts and ideas toward being God’s channel, waiting for that moment when something as gratifying as Direct Voice may be manifest. Rather, it is the application of your daily efforts and prayers that is important at this moment. This assists God in clearing away all those barriers and darkness around you.

Indeed, you live in a dark world so it is a constant vigilant to remove any conditions that are wayward and that nurture that which is not in harmony with God. You indeed keep your angel friends and those bright spirits who work with you very busy in their efforts to assist you in this regard, in their efforts to help build light around you at all times.

For some of you, even in your daily environment, there are aspects of darkness and challenges that beset you. I know that these challenges can serve as a great testing ground and can open up deeper insights, wisdom and discernment so that you may grow in your souls and in your consciousness, that light may flourish within you and around you.

Remember that any circumstance, provided it is not willfully created in order to extinguish the light may be neutralized and blessed by God. For those of you who have deep challenges in your life, I say to you, you are deeply blessed, that these challenges are indeed a blessing, that you are true and beautiful lights as you confront these conditions and, in your prayers and efforts, bring light to them.

Each of you, as I have said, have your challenges. Each of you have your strengths. Together you form a very powerful body of light among you. This is our goal, to bring you together into this body of light that may be utilized in order to develop and nurture this gift and many gifts within you. For, it is not just the gift of Direct Voice that will be seeded within you but those gifts that lie within your soul will continue to awaken with prayer and your efforts together and your efforts singly as you prepare for this time.

The prospect of Direct Voice is merely an avenue in which God may inspire and you may be motivated to reach greater light and truth and love. I am not suggesting that we are manipulating you, for we are not. Yet indeed, we view this gift and your ambitions towards it very differently from your perspective upon the Earth plane. God’s plan for the salvation of humanity will manifest in many, many different ways and will come about whether you are successful in creating and manifesting Direct Voice or not.

Indeed, this effort together is a marvelous opportunity to bring you together in a powerful condition of light. For we in the spirit world to work upon you mortals who are willing to sit in this light and energies in order that we may work to help you unleash this wonderful gift, there is so much to be accomplished. It is like building a new structure and each step must be carefully considered and put into place precisely so that you have as the end creation something wondrous to behold.

So, I beseech you, my beloved friends, to treat each day as a wonderful gift, a gift full of challenges, a gift full of surprises, a gift full of many blessings and love. The more you focus upon this gift and nurture gratitude for having this gift of a day in your life, an opportunity to serve God, an opportunity to come closer to God, then you will have prepared yourselves well for the day in which you come to be a part of this Circle of Light.

This is not a trifling matter. We are not making mere suggestions. We are imploring to seek greater light, to make greater effort towards the light. It is not an impossible task. To apply yourself in this way will bring untold blessings to your being and will nurture a light of joy that will grow and grow within you. This too will open the avenues for your soulful understanding and perspective for it is in the shifting of your consciousness from solely of the material mind to a blending of your mind and your soul so that we may work with you more effectively.

When this gift is realized, and we may guide you clearly so that there are no missteps for as we implant the gift within you with God’s blessing so we are trusting you to carry this great gift with humility, with wisdom, with integrity, with love, and with grace for we do not give such gifts to those who are immature and not able to carry such a responsibility and think of their own gain and needs rather than God’s Will and plan.

You must put what you call your ego aside and come to God with all humility. God, as you well know, will know whether you are sincere and serious about your intentions. I urge you, beloved friends, to consider your intentions, to project ahead regarding what your life will be if this gift is realized within you. It would mean that you will have to give up some things in your life that you value greatly at this time.

Many of you desire privacy and anonymity. I say to you that if and when this gift is realized, such things will not be possible. Many, many souls will come to you, insisting upon your attentions and your dedications to help humanity come to greater light. Indeed, this may be challenging for some. So, I wish to encourage you to consider where the barriers lie within you. What holds you back from releasing your will to God’s Will, from allowing God to guide you each and every day? When God guides you each day, know that you are nurtured, your families are nurtured, that all is in harmony, that even though you may give up some of those things that you hold dear within your minds, I say to you that these things are somewhat irrelevant, that indeed, this is the great venture of a soul awakening and a soul seizing its destiny in the world. This destiny may be far different from how you imagine it. It is a soul’s journey and a soul’s awakening that will inform your steps.

As the Earth changes and things shift upon your Earth, so your steps will be different and come into greater harmony with these changes. God will guide you with each step. God will bring you to the realization of your true self. In that, you will realize many gifts and capacities and possibilities that you never realized were within you. There is so much within you that is yet to be discovered.

But I tell you, each of you is capable of carrying this gift, of realizing this gift, of expressing this gift in guided ways and that when that time comes when you are called, know that the angels of heaven will gather about you, that God’s blessing, His Hand will be upon you, that all will flow in a magnificent and wondrous outpouring of love. You will find the deepest joy and satisfaction in your flow of service, the outpouring of love through you, the truth that will manifest through your gifts.

But it will take some doing for each of you to get to that point. So, each day will be a challenge for you. At times, you will feel that there are elements of darkness within you which need to be expunged for the act of releasing those conditions around your soul continues in each of your lives. The power of God’s Love will ensure that the darkness is expunged provided that through your faith and your efforts to acknowledge this that it may be released.

There will be days when you wake up with joy in your hearts, a beautiful day of joy and love and an expression of all things beautiful and harmonious within you. Each day will be different. Each day will be a gift and a blessing. Each day is important. Whether that be a day where you struggle or a day where you feel liberated, each day is important. Consider this. Do not walk through your days asleep but be aware and awake, my beloved and beautiful friends.

Know that you have been and will be a part of God’s plan. In this, you carry responsibility. You are charged with carrying the light of truth. However simple that may be, it carries a great power to transform the world. So, you are the bearers of truth, the bearers of light. It is important that you live up to this responsibility and comport yourself accordingly.

We will not tell you what you must do day in and day out but we give the parameters. We give you the guidance forward. We make great efforts to encourage you forward for we see your true selves and we see that you are all beautiful lights in the world. We also recognize that the great challenge is the material world and the world of your material mind that often impedes the great light that is within you, that this is your great challenge as you well know. To be in harmony in both your mind and soul is a great gift and a powerful expression.

So, we work to guide you and encourage you upon that particular path. To release all those things that are not in harmony with truth and love, with God and His creation and His laws. None of you are perfect and none of you shall become perfect. But I say to you that each of you have the potential to be a great light, a beautiful instrument of God, and to carry this gift of the manifestation of angels and bright spirits into the world.

So, we work with you, beloved souls, and know that we have the upmost love for you. We recognize the challenges that you have. We understand that it is not easy but we also know your inner strength, your inner light, and we see both in great abundance. This is the foundation for that which we are to build together and this is the great gift that will come to each of you.

May you continue to strive to be God’s instruments of light and love and truth. May you put aside your doubts and your fears, your anxieties, your concerns but live each life in great faith and in alignment with God. What more can you do, beloved souls, but to be in alignment with God? In this way, you have elicited the most powerful source of all blessings, all light, all love, and it is direct to you, beloved souls.

May you continue to open to this and be this true channel. My love is with you. All of us who work with you, and there are many, many who are surrounding you at this very moment, are with you in deep love and support, in prayer and action, and will continue to do so every moment. We are with you, beloveds. God is with you. God bless you. God bless you deeply with His Love. Know that you truly are loved, truly by God, by the angels, by all spirits of light and love. God bless you. 
I am Seretta Kem. God bless you and I love you.
