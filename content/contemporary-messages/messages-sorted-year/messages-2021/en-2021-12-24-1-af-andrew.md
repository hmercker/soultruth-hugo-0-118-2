Andrew received by Al Fike

Brothers and sisters, I am Andrew. I come in appreciation of your acknowledgment of my dear and beloved brother, Jesus, one who I have known for a very long time and witnessed his ministry upon the Earth and am one of his disciples. I wish to affirm your prayers and your aspirations to bring light and love to your world, that God may bless each of us and each upon this world of yours with His Love, that this Love may indeed be understood and acknowledged by each soul, and that the power of love may indeed transform your world from darkness to light.

So, you light your candles in symbolic representation of this great blessing and truth, that with love, darkness is diminished, with love, light increases. So, we all pray and walk together with this great desire that all darkness may be expunged from your world, that all suffering may cease, and that humanity may find its true journey and course toward light, that they may released from the burdens of the human condition.

Beloved souls, we all work toward these ends. We are all in harmony with God’s Will which is focused upon dispelling the darkness and bringing greater harmony to your world. So, we follow in the footsteps of our dear beloved brother Jesus and walk together as he leads us into greater light, greater truth, greater love, toward at-onement with our Heavenly Father. We are His children. All of us are His children. We will continue to find our way toward greater light. As we pray and make our supplications to God, so God will lead us and transform us and bless us toward greater light.

God bless you, beloveds. May you come to truly understand Jesus’s message and truly live it with each breath for this is the way of light. This is the power of light. This is the glory of light expressed by love, the Love of God, the love of humanity, the love of all that is God’s creation. So, love will take the darkness away and replace it with light. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Andrew and my love is with you, with you all as you continue on your journeys. My love is with this world of yours and all who struggle, all who seek for truth, all who come to be with God. So, we are together, unified in truth, in love, in light. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
