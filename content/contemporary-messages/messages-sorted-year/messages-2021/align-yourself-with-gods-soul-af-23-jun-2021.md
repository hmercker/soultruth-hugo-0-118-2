# Align Yourself with God’s Soul

I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to say that the world needs more  souls like yourself who are seeking light. So much is lacking in your modern life that feeds the soul and the spirit. Indeed, there are many who have a deep desire for this but are not capable or aware of how they may answer this deep need and desire for light.

So many have turned away from religion, from other teachings and ideals which they believe may have brought a semblance of light and order to their lives. They are relying upon their minds to solve these dilemmas. Indeed, there are many moral precepts and ideas, even political, that give and subscribe a way of life that if lived would have a semblance of light within it, but your culture today is often that of cynicism and many are numb and not able to feel much at all.

These are difficult circumstances for any soul to endure. Although you do not suffer in the physical as so many who have gone before you have done, you suffer greatly within your hearts. Within your spirit there is a deadening condition, an apathy that makes it difficult to reach the light and to understand truly what light is.

Yet, among you and many who are in association with you, there is a light. This light is continually growing as you forge ahead in your relationship with God and as you continue to sensitize yourself to that inner place where you know God and you know your true self.

These things that you experience, know, feel and practice each day are coveted by others but often they are too fearful or judgmental to come to you and to seek your counsel. I urge you, beloved souls, to continue to be those examples of light and be souls radiating joy, strength, truth and peace, for eventually these timid souls will come to you. Eventually, many will come to you, as you are consistent with your efforts, prayers and love. 
There are many spirits in the spirit world who are drawn to you each and every moment of your existence for you carry a light and this light draws those who are in darkness, pain, and confusion. As you carry this light, so you draw the angels close. So, we in the Celestial Kingdom in association with many spirits in the bright spheres will attend to these curious souls, the ones that are in darkness in the spirit world.

You need not concern yourself too intently with these individuals. Rather, a prayer will be sufficient. In that prayer, ask that these lost souls be attended to in light. Indeed, in your instrumentality, much of which you do not understand, nor are aware of, you are being used to help these individuals. It does not need to be a conscious thing, rather, an intention from your soul to God that asks God to use you as His instruments of light in the world. So, He answers your prayers. So, He carries you forward in light, protects you and guides you.

Much is coming in the way of opportunities for each one of you. You only just begin your work. I say to you, in preparation, you must continue to pray earnestly, intensely, and often as we have said many times over. The more that you pray and receive the blessings of God’s Love, the greater the light within you, the more prepared you are to serve God and to serve your brothers and sisters. 

Seek His Love and put your mind to this great blessing and journey toward truth. Put this above all other things. If you prioritize your life in such a way that God’s blessings and the awakening of your soul is foremost in your life, then I say to you, all of those experiences, knowings, and understandings of the soul will come readily with your deep desires. It is a matter of application. It is a matter of focus and desire. As your souls open to God, so the blessings flow, so the awakenings come, and so the experiences come intensely bringing great joy. 

The entire universe of God awaits you, beloved souls. Seek that universe. Align yourself with God’s universe. Align yourself with God’s Soul and you will come to know wonderments, joy, awakenings, and fulfillment as your gifts flourish and are used by God for the benefit of humanity.

May God bless you on that journey, beautiful bright souls that you are, and keep you in His Love and Light, keeping you close, upon that path that is the Divine Path. Be true to yourselves and be true to God as all else will come as a result of your earnest efforts. 

God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine and come to uplift and encourage you, beloved souls. May His Love continue to flow into your souls, a never-ending stream that becomes a beautiful container of light, that becomes ever bigger and expands and encompasses you and expands out from you into the world, into the universe. 

God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
