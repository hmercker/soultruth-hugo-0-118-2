# The power of God's love

April 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2021

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

God brings His blessings upon you, beloved souls. I am Jesus, I come to pray with you, to reassure you that each one resides within the Light, that your souls continue to long for God and God responds by infusing your souls with His Love.

As you continue to pray together so God weaves you together in these exquisite patterns, these beautiful patterns which change as each individual contributes their light to this wonderful fabric that you are creating together. So in this warp and weave of light coming together in the desires of your soul and the prayers expressed thereof so a magnificent and beautiful tapestry is formed, creating this circle of light, enhancing and bringing together all of your beautiful thoughts, desires of the soul, your needs, your expectations of God that He may bless you together in this beautiful light.

Each of you is drawn and you come together as souls, brothers and sisters all. You come to pray together and be together to affirm this truth that you are loved and that God’s Love for you continues to flow in its infinite blessing upon your soul. You are loved, beloveds, precious to God. And so in the joy and the gratitude of this fellowship and this knowledge of truth, so we walk hand in hand in the world. So we will be a light in the world, we in the spirit and you upon the flesh, together we work to bring greater light to every soul upon your world. Pray for this, beloveds, pray that God may infuse the desire for this Love within every soul, that this great body of humanity may indeed find upliftment and redemption in Love, the great Love and Essence of God wiping away that which fractures and inhibits the true desire of the soul which is for Light and the blessings that are of God’s creation and universe.

May you come to know all that is meant for each of you in these great bounties of blessings, this beautiful flow of light, this peace that passes all understanding. These things are meant for each of you, none are denied in God’s universe, all are welcome no matter their condition. If they seek God and beseech God for His blessings, so it will come. Do not judge your brothers and sisters but have great compassion and love for all. Allow God’s Love to flow through you to all that you may be His instruments, His channels of Love. Do not let your minds trip you up as you relate to each individual you meet in your day. May your heart be pure, your mind filled with joy and with the intention to bless another as God’s instrument in the world. In this way you protect yourselves from the onslaught of the darkness and negative forces that so desire to put out your light but cannot with the power of God’s Love residing within your soul. The only avenue for darkness to enter is through your thoughts, beloveds and may your thoughts be that of love, of gratitude, of joy, of appreciation of the beautiful gift of life that is given to each of you. Much can come on the heels of the uniting of the desire of the mind and the soul to be in alignment with God. Much can come for the benefit of many through each of you. May you know that God has chosen you to be His channels of Light and that through your prayers and desires, your efforts and all that comes into your life as a blessing, you are coming into greater alignment with God’s Will and you will find your way upon that path, each of you continuing to blossom in the Light of God’s Love. It is yours every moment of every day. As you seek it, so it shall flow in great abundance, transforming your soul and thereby transforming everything that is you as this blessing grows and strengthens and becomes the great harbinger and guide for your life. A soul awakened is more beautiful than any other creation of God. It has in itself the greatest potentials of any creation that God has created for the soul is a magnificent thing, brimming with potential, brimming with possibilities, brimming with gifts, brimming with great expressions of that which has a touch of divine within it and shall grow in this great blessing of Love which is God’s Essence upon your soul.

God bless you, beloved souls. May you continue to grow in Light, discover your true potential, your true purpose in the world, awakening, awakening all that is you, awakening all that God has meant for you, awakening all that God shall guide you upon your journey of life, of love and service. So it shall awaken, so you shall know the great bounty that God shall give to His children, never ending, beyond the scope of your mind. As your souls awaken so you will come to know how wondrous God truly is and how wonderful His Love can be, bringing unlimited joy, truth, wonderment, peace, Light for all.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, Master of The Celestial Heavens, bringer of the truth of God’s Love. And so you shall be my brother and my sister upon this path, ever awakening, ever greater Light growing within you, ever more Light flowing through you. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. My love for you is great. My love for you shall continue for all eternity. God bless you, beloved souls, weavers of Light in this world so in need. God bless you, beloveds.
