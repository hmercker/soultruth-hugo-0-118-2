Matthew received by Al Fike

God bless you, precious and beloved souls, I am Matthew. We are all engaged upon a tremendous undertaking, a project that is designed to build a stairway to higher truth, to greater love and light. Each of us, including yourselves, toils greatly in constructing this structure so that others may walk upon it and rise up with each step that is created so lovingly by each of your efforts and our efforts to reach humanity bringing the truth of God's Love to the souls of this world.

As you each grow in this Love, as you each toil away in your loving efforts, so this stairway to truth grows. Its heights become lofty and what can be seen and known from these places will continue to unfold and be gifted to those who are willing to climb this stairway to Light.

Each of you within your soul know that you are a part of a great effort, that this is God's plan for the salvation of humanity, and this plan is subtle yet powerful in its undertaking. Each of you will be guided as you continue to be awakened by this great gift of Love. Each of you will find that place within this effort where your gifts and abilities are well used by God. You will find great satisfaction in your craftmanship creating this beautiful structure for God, this dedication of Love, this dedication to your brothers and sisters, saying, *"Here we are upon the threshold of something new and wonderful; here we climb step by step upon the truth that is God's gift to our souls; here we appreciate and understand what it is that we are being given and blessed with; that each step that we climb is greater understanding, is greater joy in all that unfolds and all that we can see from this higher vantage point."*

And so we climb these stairs of truth and so the atmosphere is infused with Love, and we feel the joy, the anticipation, the excitement of climbing ever higher, of coming ever closer to at-onement with God. May God bless us all on this journey as we toil away. This toiling is not of a sense of obligation nor does it press upon us with great strain but rather it is an expression of love and in an expression of love comes joy, comes the beautiful experience of your continued growth and your continued service and the awakening of your soul.

God bless you, beloved souls. May you indeed climb to lofty heights and help your brothers and sisters by reaching down and giving them some upliftment towards the light. God bless you, I am Matthew and my love is with you, beloved souls, my love and many of us in the Celestial kingdom pray and focus upon you all as you continue to journey and awaken and come to be that beautiful soul that you are meant to be. God bless you, God bless you all, beloveds.
