Andrew received by Al Fike

You have opened the portal of light and love through your prayers and God is utilizing these conditions and your intention to bring blessings to your brothers and sisters, to many who are in need.  Continue with your prayers, beloved souls. Continue to see that you are receiving not only for yourselves, but through your prayers and desires you are being a channel of light for others.

A great power comes with this. This beautiful blessing and awakening of your souls brings its response and reaction in your dark world so that many may benefit by your efforts, by the light that you bring.

Please ensure that every time that you pray that you are sincere and focused, that the longing in your soul is what comes forth, and that the desire of your soul may bring God's response in powerful ways, flows of love and healing and peace awakening the sleeping children of your world. Bringing for them the gift of hope, the gift of knowing that they are loved.

Much awaits every child upon your world given their ability to awaken to the great breath of God upon them. Continue to pray for this blessing and for all blessings upon humanity and upon your souls.

May God bless you, I am Andrew and I am happy to be with you today in prayer, in love, in light. God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you in His Love, flowing everlasting, evermore to your soul. God bless you, God bless you, beloveds. We are with you in prayer, never to leave, always to join you in the loving blessing of God's Hand upon you. God bless you.
