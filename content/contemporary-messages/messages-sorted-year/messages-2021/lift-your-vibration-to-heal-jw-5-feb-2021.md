# Lift your Vibration in order to Heal 

February 5<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


I am here your brother and friend in the Love of God. I come to this healing circle and ask each one of you to take in the vibrations of light and love that you may be lifted and healed. Most especially for the afflictions of the heart where the soul feels stagnant. 

For when one is depressed, angry, sad, in doubt, or troubled, those low vibrations do afflict the body and the mind. One can be lifted up in the natural love through herbal medicines and right posture and breathing and so forth, aligning the body back to its natural state of wellness. But when we talk about being healed in faith, we are talking about allowing the blessing of love and light to come into your soul, to lift the vibrations in your body to a state of equanimity and peace. You must trust in God, as you must trust in a human healer. 

All healing is a matter of lifting the vibration that is out of harmony or blocked to a state of light and love. For the soul this is most important and in this circle of light and love and faith in God you can allow the concerns and troubles to dissipate in the Divine Love. This yearning in the soul is answered not only in the spiritual realm but also in the physical. 

So now I go into silence with you and my wish for you all is to be blessed in the Love of God, healed in the light and grace and presence that comes with this great gift. May it be yours. May God bless each one, heal each one in this circle and beyond. I am your brother and friend in Christ, I am Yogananda.
