# The Guidance I Received in Life

January 11<sup>th</sup>, 2021

Punaluu, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh


I am here George Vale Owen. You may know me as Rev. Owen. I have been with this one today sharing from my soul and I am honored to be able to speak to you. At some point in the life of each soul the intentions of that soul to be loved come forth. For as they say: *“Intention is nine-tenths of the Law”*<sup>1</sup> and the law of God’s Love responds to intention. I was a minister of a small church, and I wished to communicate with my mother who was in spirit and I also wished to know truth, to know God’s Love. On my journey through the spheres, I had a guidepost. That guidepost being what I had received on earth which became a series of books, originally as writings received.<sup>2</sup>

This was during the same time as your beloved James Padgett was receiving his messages so full of the truths of Divine Love. My writings also include much truth about God’s Love, about the Kingdom of God where Jesus is Master. I was given visions of the spheres from the hells to the gateway of the Celestial heavens. There were many lessons conveyed through me in words that were so beautiful I could not have possibly come up with them myself.

I reached tens of thousands of people with very ordinary religious beliefs but because of the hunger in their souls, their intentions were to feel the Love of God, to receive the truth. And so, even though I was a minster in the Church of England, no one rebuked me, and I was not banished.<sup>3</sup> What I received was published and read widely. and my dear friend, who is still my dear friend, Sir Arthur,<sup>4</sup> encouraged me to to shine the light and to spread the truths that I had received, so we did work together on earth for the Kingdom and *“For the Glory of God and the Company of His Angels.”*<sup>5</sup>

When you receive something that you know is true, it is because it comes in a package of love. Your soul knows this and so you are able to share that. The highest truth being the truth of God’s Love and the reality of every soul with true intentions being able to receive it and to be changed and to progress.

There is much that can be said about the journey of the heart to find love. But what must be said is that true prayer is not a matter of having rosary beads, or going on a pilgrimage, or beating oneself up denying this, or denying that. It is a simple matter between you and God. And when you go to God, when you ask the answer comes. We always say to you *“Do not trouble yourselves with analyzing everything and trying to figure out spiritual life”* because my friends, it is a matter of the heart and a matter of the soul. God does the work for you when you open in prayer as in this circle of love. There are so many in attendance here this evening; so many.

Thank you for the honor of me being able to convey this message through my dear brother. I step back now to join you in this prayer for God’s love. With all my love and blessings, I am your brother in Christ. George Vale Owen.

**Note 3.** I was up early this morning trying to talk to Rev Owen about his being or not being *"rebuked"* and/or *"banished".*  What I felt was that he was indeed *"rebuked"* by his Bishop (and a few other clergy) and dismissed from his parish but not defrocked. At first he was quite concerned but as he embraced his mediumship and saw how many people came to his lectures as well as his support from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he realized God was going to take care of him and of course, God did.
