My beloveds, I am James and I have come to be with you in your prayers, my beloveds, to share with you your love, to bring my love, into this Circle of Light. The greatest asset you create here in this place is your love. As you clean and toil and make things in harmony in this place, you will draw to you and this place those who are meant to be residing within this home. What draws those people, those souls, is the love that you imbue within these walls. As you love this place so the Law of Attraction will draw those who will be attracted by this love and will be receptive and find great joy here.
 
Yes, you create a gift, a gift of love, a blessing from God, and those individuals who are meant to reside within this place will be drawn by the Light you create. Think of it from this perspective, my dear beloveds. You create a home for beautiful souls and it is a gift which you are allowing God to work through you to gift to another. Do all in love with this perspective. This is an enacting of God’s Will and Love and a blessing for those who come. Even things of the material can be a part of God’s Blessing and can be in the flow of God’s Love. As you give in love, so Love is given, as you act in love, so God can act through you in Love. 

This is an important lesson and do not restrict your concepts of what being a channel of Love is, my beloveds. Being a channel of Love can manifest in many, many ways, in many situations and conditions, and it is what you bring to those conditions, what you enact within the situation and the opportunity which is given that is important. Your attitudes and thoughts, your actions and deeds, and how you approach any given situation in your life are important. And yes, the conditions of the material world are challenging, often difficult and they require taxing efforts on your part. But all that is done in love brings a blessing to you, my beloveds, as it does to those who are the object of your ministrations, as it does to any object you administer to. You bring Light, you bring the conditions up a higher level and of course, each of you desires to reach for the highest, to act in harmony with God’s Will and to be in that flow of Love. And I see that you indeed are doing so in this situation and this is a wonderful thing to perceive, to observe you working together in love, praying together with an open and earnest soul, working together to create a greater harmony in this place. This is beautiful to behold and it gives a great blessing to you, my beloveds, as you work through the problems presented to you each day and come to a place of resolution and harmony. 

So it is in life, many challenges and problems and situations that need resolutions and solutions, love and harmony. You work together to forge a bond, an understanding of one another. This will bode well for the future and what will be placed before you as you work together as God’s channels of Love in the world, and even in this situation so material in its nature brings blessings to you all. And you must see this through your eyes, the eyes of your soul, for each moment is a Gift from God, each opportunity brings within it the possibility of growth, growth of your soul, growth of understanding, expanding your consciousness, applying your love in many different ways and God is with you as you toil away, my brothers and sisters. God is with you and so are we. 

God bless you, beautiful souls. You come together because you are drawn together, work together because you love one another, and in this you bring a gift to those who are coming, to reside in this home, a wonderful gift. Bless you, for your loving efforts, bless you for your willingness to give in love, to toil in love, to pray together. Bless you.  I am James and I love you.
