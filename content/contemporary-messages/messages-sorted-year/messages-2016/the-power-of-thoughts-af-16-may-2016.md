Beloved souls, I am Simon. I am Simon of the Bible and a resident of the Celestial Kingdom and I have come to speak about the power of thoughts and about the power of your own mind. Your world is full of thoughts. Your world is full of information, intellectual, conceptual, with many teachings and perspectives and understandings. And yet much of this which flows into your material minds does not benefit your souls. It does not truly bring spiritual growth. The mind expands, collects, absorbs many things and many thoughts. It observes and deduces and takes into account all this stimuli, which you are all immersed in daily, and this brings about an imbalance in your being as the mind is overstimulated, with too much information, and too much going on in your thoughts. And you then struggle to come to your centre, to your soul and be with God in this way as your thoughts dance around and distract and interfere. 

Now you must move in this world. You must deal with many things that require the attributes of the material mind, but you must also take time in quiet, releasing these thoughts, isolating yourself from the bombardment of all this stimulation and come to a place of quiet in prayer to be at peace and to know God. For when the soul is in this life, and is filled with the Father’s Love, is awakened, then there comes a greater balance within you and often this is a bit of a tug of war between the desires of your soul which are quite different from the desires of your mind. There is often a conflict between the two. But you must listen, beloveds, to what your soul has to say. You must discover the wisdom of your soul, the desires of your soul and with enough Divine Love within, you will begin to know God and His Will as easily as you know your own. This will be invaluable and powerful as you move and in the days to come, for God needs channels of Love, he needs those who know His Will in the world, to help those who are lost who do not know and are seeking truth and will be need of assistance and comfort as the world changes. 
And the world will change, my beloveds. These changes are upon you and will intensify and you will need the wisdom of your soul to navigate these changes and adjust to that which is coming. Continue to pray for this Love. 

Acknowledge your souls and put your mind at ease, and rest, and peace and allow the wonderful insights and knowledge and Love come forth into your consciousness, recognized and cherished by your mind. This is necessary if you do indeed wish to be God’s channels of Love in the world. It is a process, a gradual opening. It does not come overnight, but for some of you it has been many years and for some enough years to come to that place of acknowledging your souls in a deeper way without resisting and being suspicious. But in trusting and loving all parts of your being with the desire that all within you is in balance and harmony and in alignment with God. It takes strength and a measure of discipline. It takes faith and a deep desire to overcome the obstacles which you all face. 

And your minds which have been so well trained and educated need to come to a place that is in greater harmony with all of you, all parts of you, especially your soul, and the mind of your soul. You will receive the assistance that you need to come to that place of balance, of peace, of being with God. God has sent His angels to be with you for this very purpose, to help you, to inspire you, to be with you in their Light and love for you. It all comes from this simple desire for Love and you will truly know this in your lifetimes if you choose to walk upon the Divine Path and release the dominance of your mind and accept the great and powerful wisdom of your soul. A great challenge in this world, so heavy with thought, but with it will come great rewards and true capacity to teach others, to lead them to that place of harmony and Love, which the world is in great need of. There is so much imbalance that is present in this world. Love is required. Love will heal. Love will bring the balance. 

Continue, beloved souls, to seek the truth, to gain ever more of this great blessing of Love and you will find your way to that place of Light and joy, wisdom and harmony. God bless you. I am Simon and I love you. I thank you for this opportunity to speak this day. God bless you.
