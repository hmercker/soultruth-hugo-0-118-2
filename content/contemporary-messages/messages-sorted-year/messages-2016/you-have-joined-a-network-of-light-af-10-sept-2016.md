It is Andrew. You have come together and prayed together and in so doing you have joined in a network of Light that shall bring to you many blessings, and that will entangle you, so to speak, in God’s beautiful flow of his blessings to the world. Each time you pray you will benefit from this connection that you made this night. You will find that prayer will be easier, that there will be an opening to God in a deeper way and if you ask for help in your prayers, help to be able to pray, help to come to know this Truth, God will send an angel to you, to help you in this struggle, to rise above the human condition into a place of deep peace and presence of God. 

So, my beloveds, you’ve been given a Gift. I urge you to continue to pursue this, to make some time within your life, within your mind, to think and contemplate, to pray and to be quiet, to reach to God who is ever eager to reach to you. All it requires is some time, some focus, to come to know that soul desire within you and you will receive the answers you are looking for, the powerful blessing of the Father’s Love and this, beloveds, will impactful, powerful, glorious. As you open to this Truth and come to know that you are truly loved. 

God bless you, beloveds, and thank you for coming together, for listening to our words, for making that effort to be open. May you continue in your pursuit to find God. We will be with you. We will be with you. God bless you, I am Andrew. I love you.
