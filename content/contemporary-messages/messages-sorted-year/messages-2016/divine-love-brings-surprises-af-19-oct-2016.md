You asked for me to come, I’m here. Who likes a surprise? I love surprises. And many surprises are coming, my friends. Surprises unanticipated, surprises full of change for each one of you, bringing joy, bringing shifts in your thinking, maybe even bringing shifts in where you live and how your life is, for God has a plan for each soul who is willing to listen to their guidance, their promptings, and their inspirations. They come from God and His angels and in this way life becomes one big surprise, not knowing what is around the corner, not knowing who is around the corner. 

So many surprises. Do not resist God’s Will but accept in gratitude all the blessings that come to you, even when you do not anticipate these great blessings and they come as a big surprise. It is all a gift. It is all beautiful in the flow of God’s great Love to you and to this world. Be joyful that this life, your life is full of surprises, for would it not be a dull place without these interesting turns of events and unanticipated blessings and all the beautiful souls you meet that you never imagined to meet in all those places that you travel to, that you never imagined you would go and all those shifts within your beautiful souls as God’s Love does its work within you? 

Many blessings, beloveds, many surprises coming. Be open. Be joyful and know that what comes with each gift is meant to be and is a blessing from God. God bless you. I am Goldie and I love you. I love you.
