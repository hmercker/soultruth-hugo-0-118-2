I see that you are eager to spread the truths of the gospel of the new birth, that you are eager to assist the angels in this great effort to bring this truth to the world and you are eager to be disciples of this truth and I am well pleased by your efforts and your desires and your love for the truth and for your Heavenly Father. 

Each of you must stand up and be counted, each must speak these truths where the opportunity and God’s guiding hand brings you forth in this world. Speak the truth of God’s Love, for God will take you by the hand and show you the way, open the doors and connect you with all the loving souls who have a desire and an eagerness and a soul understanding of what it is that you are to convey to this world. And when you make these efforts, when you bring this message you must endeavour to be in the flow of God’s Love always, to be an example of this truth always, to walk that Path Divine and be that channel of Love. And each of you, my beloveds, each of you have great capacities and gifts and perspectives and perceptions which in combination will make you a powerful teacher of these truths and an example for others to follow. 

This is God’s Love in action, bringing forth your own unique selves, those beautiful parts of your being that lie within your souls, that are a part of your true identity, that these aspects of yourself will come forth as you are in the flow of God’s Love and Will in this world. Grasp the opportunities available to you to be God’s channels of truth and Love, to teach, to bring the blessing of healing, to set forth and show the way to at-onement with God and the liberation and awakening of the soul through Love. 

Beloved souls, each of you will find your place and your way in which to do this work. Each of you have been imbued with great purpose in this regard and will find the expression of that purpose through your unique selves, your beautiful souls. As the Love within builds and cleanses and ignites your great souls, you will see more clearly, more emphatically, what it is that you must do in this world. You get glimpses and see with eyes hardly open and even in this you have found inspiration and motivation to set out into the world and bring this wonderful truth to mankind and this is a wonderful indication as to the strength of your soul and the focus of your desires, and the expression of your true and wonderful selves in the world. This can only grow with the Love. This can only become more beautiful and more directed and perfected by the Love. 

Always be close to God, my beloveds, and in your prayers, your longings, your connection with your Heavenly Father will come all that you require to do this. This mission, this great effort in which we are all engaged, to bring the truths of the Divine Love to mankind, to bring the bell toll that will awaken the souls and show the way to joy and light and life everlasting. 

Beautiful Lights, we’re with you in your efforts, we love you, we walk with you, we help to inspire you and as you toil away at your various projects we will help you to make it a joy. It will unfold, come together in harmony and you will find ways, creative ways, innovative ways, to bring this truth to mankind so that they may be receptive and inspired and rejoice with this great news, this wondrous truth. Yes, you will carry on holding your banners high, the banners of truth and in this you will continue to uncover the gifts that lie within you, the purpose that is unique to each one of you and the Love that God has implanted within your souls, through your prayers and longings to him. It will flourish and bloom and be expressed as a mighty Light within each one of you, beloved souls. 

And I walk with you. I light the way for you and I shall never leave you, beloveds. I am with you and I love you and you are my brothers and sisters upon this glorious path of Love.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Jesus and I love you dearly. God bless you.
