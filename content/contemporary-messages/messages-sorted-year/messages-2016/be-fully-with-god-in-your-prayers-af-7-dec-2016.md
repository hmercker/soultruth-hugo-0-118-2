Our Master has given you a powerful blessing. He brings his love to encourage you upon your journey and in your efforts to work together in light. It is indeed good to pray for others, to give your loving support to many and have we not provided you with a vehicle to pray for others in the form of the prayer bowl? In this way you may write down their names, bring them into your consciousness and put them within this vessel. This Allows you in your prayers the freedom to go deep within yourself, and to be released from this mental obligation to pray for others. 

Prayer cannot and should not be a burden nor should it be a distraction. It is an expression of your soul and it comes from that place of deep longing, of pure intention, of the desire to reach for something higher that will heal you and mend the broken heart and the disturbances of the soul as the great Love of God pours into you. It will do this, it will heal you, it will bring you a deep peace and a powerful joy. 

Each of you seeks this liberation from the burdens of this world. Each of you wants to be close to God and seeks His blessings upon you. When you are in prayer, go deep, do not worry about your obligations towards others, say a prayer and let them go and be in that deep ocean of God’s Love and peace and you will find the liberation you seek. And when you emerge from this beautiful, deep place you can then go into the world bringing much to others. For you have been replenished, you have grown a little more in light, you have found a little more of God and you have brought that within yourself. 

The enfoldment of your true selves begins, my beloveds, and you get glimpses and visions, feelings and impressions, vague understandings, and intense moments of revelation. All of this comes as you seek the Father’s Love and it is not for you to press the issue of what will come to your consciousness. No, my beloveds, pray and be at peace, be with God and all will unfold in good time, in ways harmonious, and with clarity pure, in understanding clear. 

You need not worry or fret, be at peace and know that you are loved and know that in time every soul will find love, some form of love, a great joy, an awakening. The joy that you have found what you are looking for and it will flourish within you and grow, and grow. Your lives will open and be clear in vision, your heart will open and be powerful in love, your soul will revel in the embrace of God. With this as your reality you can  but give love to all you meet, to give because you are love, to speak because you know truth, to be because you are awakened and will be that beautiful soul that God created.

Give love, my beloveds, and if the form of this love is in a prayer for another then by all means give that prayer but always come to that place where you and God are one and there is no thought of anything else but your communion with your Heavenly Father. This is most important and crucial. It is not selfish, it is what is meant to be for you, it is what God craves, for this communion to be in its pure and wondrous form. To be with God, truly, completely, joyfully, beloveds, be with God.

God bless you.
