# Blessings of healing and Love



December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2016

Punaluâ€™u, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike.


It is Confucius.

You have all come together for healing and you will receive healing as you are together in this group. You will come away from these times with deeper insights and less burdens and greater joy within you. Continue to pray in your circles and you will see how you are lighter with each day, more joyful, and a deeper understanding will come with your prayers together.

God bless you beloveds, God bless you. Confucius is with you, God bless you.
