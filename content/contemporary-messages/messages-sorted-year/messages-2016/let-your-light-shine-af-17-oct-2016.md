It is Keea atta Kem. Do not restrict the flow of Love through you, my beloveds, at any time for God puts upon your path many souls so that they may be blessed through your channel of Love, that there be some Light given to all that you meet. And  you will be surprised at whom you will meet as you continue to go out into the world and be that channel of Love that God desires you to be. 

Do not hide your Light but allow it to shine forth, always, in all its purity and beauty. Do not be shy but be open and joyful and embrace it. Smile at all you meet with eyes, walk in this world in joy, be a Light, for how the world hungers for this, to be a Light, to bring joy wherever you go, to walk with God in His never-ending flow of Love, to allow His touch through you to many. And how is this accomplished? By merely being close to God and in being close to God you are attuned to the flow of His Love in the world. You allow in this simple way the blessings to flow, the Love to touch, the healing and comfort to go out those whom God desires to touch, who are open and who pray for this gift, this touch.

Are we not all His channels of Love? Do we not all wish to give Love and to reach for that higher road of service, to draw to us that great Light that God so desires to bestow upon us, to bring within our souls His Divine Essence that will ignite the opening and awakening of our souls, that will ignite a deeper understanding and perception of life, that will bring that deep joy and that open channel for so many? 

Every soul you meet is precious to God and we ask you to see each soul in this Light, to walk with each, however briefly, with love and a deep acknowledgement of God’s beautiful creation. Each soul, each soul is precious and as you grow in the Light, as you begin to turn your gaze upon yourself and acknowledge how precious you are, how beautiful you are, how wondrous is your creation, your being, all the beauty that lies within you, all the beauty that is expressed through you, all the beauty that rises up from your soul’s Light, in this way you then have eyes to see the beauty in others. As His Love grows within you, your capacity to love also grows, your desire to love becomes stronger, the expression of that love purer and with love comes much of God’s blessings through you, within you a deep wisdom, an acknowledgement, an understanding of those great and powerful and simple truths that are all enwrapped in Love and Light and joy.

See yourselves in this wondrous Light always and God will guide you to many souls who have a deep desire to have what you have, to acknowledge their own Light and beauty, to be fulfilled in this wondrous river of Love. You continue to grow, to expand in your souls. You continue to acknowledge this within your minds and soon all of these teachings will become second nature to you,  as God’s Love transforms you from within and brings you to that conscious and powerful awakening that will truly be an expression of God’s Love within. 

God bless you, beloved souls. May your Lights continue to shine in this world and may we continue to walk with you as your guardians and teachers, as your friends, and may God’s great Light envelope everything that you do in this world and everything that you are and will be as you traverse this eternal path to at-onement. God bless you, I am Keea and I love you dearly. God bless you. God bless you.
