Your teacher Augustine is here with you in your prayer, encouraging you to seek God within your hearts, your minds, and your souls, for it is in this search for the Creator, the Source of all, that you will find a deep fulfilment and understanding, an acknowledgment of how loved you are, my beloved, beloved souls. For each soul here longs for that connection with God and each soul must open themselves to the inflowing of His Love, for in this the bond is created with God and that bond creates within you a great and deep strength, opens your awareness to many deep truths, brings meaning and purpose to your lives. 

So many in this world drift and have no anchor which brings them clear direction and understanding and it is important to secure yourselves with the Heavenly Father. He will bring direction and guidance and truth and meaning to your lives, and His Love will flow upon you in abundance. His beautiful touch will bring you comfort and strength and heal you from your deep wounds, wounds that come with every mortal who lives a life in this world. Yes, with this healing comes a release and a great joy. With this Love comes upliftment and an understanding that goes beyond the mind and is sourced from the soul. 

Seek God, my beloveds. Come to know His Touch and you will know that deep and joyful freedom and expansion and knowing that comes from a soul enlivened and awakened by the Divine Touch of Love.

God bless you, beloveds. Your teacher Augustine ever with you and loves you dearly. God bless you.
