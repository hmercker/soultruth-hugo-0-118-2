December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2016

God will lift your burdens, free you of your pain and bring you into the freedom and glory of His loving light. 

Precious souls, the Will of God will be apparent as you continue to serve God and do unto God. God will carry you, always, never to be abandoned always to be uplifted. There will be no turning back to the darkness for any of you, my beloveds, you will continue to move forward in the light and walk the path of truth, shedding all that is not of his truth and not of God’s great and wondrous Creation. You will find your harmony, beloved souls, because you are destined to be lights in the world. As each year passes, your lights will brighten as each year passes the doors will open and you will find your way as disciples of the Master. 

Beloved souls, God’s Children, your innocence and light, truth and wisdom, love, Love Divine. Awaken my children, awaken let His love touch you deeply, every nook and cranny and crevice and part of you, healed by this Love.
 
I am John the Beloved.   
