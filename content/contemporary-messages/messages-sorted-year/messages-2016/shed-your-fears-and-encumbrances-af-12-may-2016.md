God bless you. There are many changes coming, beloved souls, both within you and around you. Each of you will be positioned to become a powerful channel in this world, a channel for truth and Love and in order to have the flexibility to be willing and able to serve in these capacities you must indeed shed more skins and fears, encumbrances, even material encumbrances. In order to be effective, in order that you may pick up at a moment’s notice and be guided to a place, a person, an opportunity to be used in this way you must allow those inner changes to take place. As you continue to grow and discuss these opportunities for service, remember, you must be strong, you must build your faith and you must trust in God’s Wisdom and guidance. At times you will hesitate to make these leaps of faith but I tell you that there is a plan. There is a great plan and to be an effective part of God’s plan for the salvation of mankind, there will be sacrifices which are not truly sacrifices but they will feel like it within your minds, even though your souls will rejoice in these great leaps, adjustments and changes in your life.

No one will suffer from this. All those you love will be taken care of. But it does require detaching from some elements in your life which do hold you back, which do cause barriers and bring you to a place of rigidity in your thinking. Yes, growing in the Love requires many changes. As you are reborn in this Grace and blessing it takes strength and faith. It takes a willingness of the heart to go with God’s flow of Love, to allow that burning, joyful flame within you to be your focus, to be all that which you require in life and all those things you thought you needed will not be required. 

As you change so your lives change. As you allow God to take you down this road of Love, of living in harmony with the laws of His Love, of being a powerful example of this, teaching and healing, of serving, and loving, those things that draw your energy now, that are not of this Path and flow and must fall away, and you will be a different person in many respects. Different in what you do, what you think, who you are, for you will be governed by your soul, not by your mind. And all those encumbrances that have been placed within your mind over the years must fall away. 

Yes, it is a great challenge. It is a great challenge. But as you are strong enough to allow this process to unfold in Love and harmony you will know the great rewards, the freedom, the joy that comes with this awakening and rebirth. And in this flow, in this Light, this wonderful awakening, you will be those instruments that you long to be and those channels of Love that you know you can be. This beautiful awakening will bring many wondrous works, touch many souls, have a great effect in this world, for you want the world to change do you not? How can the world change if you do not change? How can the world know what path to take if you do not take that path? How can there be true change without example?

Yes, my friends, you truly want this. God truly wants this for you and we are ever ready to assist you in this rebirthing of your soul and the rebirthing of your lives and allowing the old you, the old life, the old ways to fall away bit by bit as you step forth into this new life. Every step will be blessed. Every time you shed something that is not meant to be carried you will feel joy. Much will be given, beloveds, to assist you. You do not need to feel fearful or concerned for your loved ones or any part of your old life and your present life which is in transition even as we speak. But to know in confidence, trust, faith and joy that you are truly becoming in harmony with your Creator and knowing your soul and walking the path that you are meant to walk. All will be well. When a door opens walk through it, beloveds. When something that comes to your mind that you know is not in harmony release it. When you feel fear ask God to bring you strength. When you know you are judging, when you know you are in error, make a choice for Light. Stop and pray.

Beloved souls, you are at a critical juncture in your lives with many transitions and changes. Know that you are being watched over, protected and guided and that your lives will unfold in harmony. Know that you are being carried in the flow of God’s Love always. God is with you and you are slowly coming close to God. God bless you. Your friend, Alec is with you often and I am excited for what is coming. It is truly wonderful. You will see, you will see. God bless you and I love you.
