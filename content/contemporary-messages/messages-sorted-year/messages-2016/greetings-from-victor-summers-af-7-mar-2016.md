# Greetings from Victor Summers



March 7<sup>th</sup>, 2016

Selah, Washington, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike.


It is your friend, Victor. My dear KO, I love you so dearly and you were such a good friend to me when we walked together in this world. And I want you to know that you have a beautiful heart and a keen desire to serve God and you will find your way. You will find your way to this service, to bring Love into this world but first you must bring Love into yourself, to be healed by God’s Love, to be at peace within yourself and to have the physical healing that you require, to be strong. God awaits you. God is ever waiting for you to reach to Him, to receive this Love, to receive the healing that you require, and to receive the peace within yourself, that passes all understanding. My beloved friend, reach to God always and know that God is with you and draws you into these circles of Light so that you may see more clearly and love more deeply. 

Beloved, friend, and all my beloved friends, thank you for the efforts that you make to bring God’s Love more fully into this world. Thank you. And I continue to progress, my friends. I am now on the doorstep to Heaven in the Seventh Sphere. I continue to progress and feel the bounty of God’s Love welling up within my soul and releasing all those conditions and encrustments upon my soul. I am almost fully redeemed. Just another little step and I will join all my beloved brothers and sisters in the Celestial Kingdom. What joy I feel and what joy you will feel as you follow in our footsteps to Heaven.
 
And your footsteps will be swift, my friends, for you serve in such beautiful ways and love in such fullness. And you will see how God will guide you and take you on this journey to bring many souls upon the Path Divine. This is coming. It is in the process of unfolding and you feel it and know it within yourselves. Do not doubt yourselves or second guess yourselves for this was my great Achilles heel. I doubted so often, and so much of my own thinking interfered with God’s guidance for me and this caused some difficulties in my life and my ministry and you, my friends, must put aside your doubts and put aside those feelings of unworthiness, put aside any thoughts that are unloving towards yourselves and others. Be kind and generous, full of love. 

This is the key that will open so many doors and bring you to those places that God needs for you to be in the world. So much Light awaits you. I can witness to this, my friends, the power and the glory of God’s Love, the redeeming powers of His Touch within your soul. It has redeemed me and I feel such joy in this Touch that God has placed within my soul. And each of you knows this Touch. Do not turn away from the Light but continue ever forward upon this Path Divine and I will do what I can to assist you as many Angels dedicate their efforts on your behalf. For this work that you do is so crucial for the world, so very crucial. If you could see the support that you receive and the beautiful Angels that pray for you and surround you, and influence and guide and protect you, you would truly be humbled by this knowledge. 

My friends, carry on with the work started by our dear brother Padgett, begun by our dear brother Jesus. Continue the work. May the chain be unbroken and your efforts powerful and full of Love and Light, Grace and joy, wisdom and power, the power of Love.

Dear friend, be comforted in the sure knowledge that God loves you, God loves you fully for every second and every part that you are. God loves you, my friend. Bring in this Love and let it comfort you and bring peace. Bring in this joy, for life is joy, you can embrace joy and embrace life. Beloveds, beautiful souls, I am Victor Summers and I stand upon the threshold of Heaven. God bless you, bless you.
