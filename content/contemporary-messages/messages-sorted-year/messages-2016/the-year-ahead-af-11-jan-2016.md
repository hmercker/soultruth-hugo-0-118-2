God bless you, beloved souls, I am Matthew and I have come to speak with you about the year that is to come as you mark the passing of each year and this becomes a milestone for what you have accomplished within your own lives and within your own souls, the growth and expansion of the Father’s Love and you look ahead for what might be in service, in growth, in changes within your life. And I tell you, my beloveds, there is much change ahead for each one of you, many shifts within your beings, for many of you are on the verge of awakenings, openings, shiftings and understanding much deeper, more fully in your awareness of God’s Truth within you, as the love continues to flow abundantly within your souls, my beloveds. Indeed your eyes begin to open, you begin to bloom in the warmth of God’s beautiful Love. 

And many of you will travel this year and some of those travels will be unexpected and unplanned but very fortuitous. And you will go to these places to teach, to be beacons of Light, to reinforce the efforts of your brothers and sisters who are eager to open the door to God’s Love, this awareness for many who are seeking, who desire this. Indeed there will be many opportunities, my beloved, beautiful souls, to converse with those who are seeking. You may do so over the wires, you may do so through visits and coming together in gatherings for prayer to increase the love bonds between you, and you will be meeting other souls who are of like mind, who have God’s Love within them, although their perceptions of Truth, their language, understanding, may be somewhat different from your own. 

You are ready, my beloveds, to embrace them and accept without prejudice or bias, but love, love. For you begin to understand the currency of love, how this is the most precious thing you can possess and you can give and you can receive. And this will become your mission, the focus of your life, to live each day with love, to be a channel of God’s Love, to receive His Love, to give His Love, to walk in His Love, to share His Love. And never underestimate the power of this Love, the value of this Love, how it is the agent that will change the world and bring it from its dark place, the suffering and the error to a place of healing and life and harmony. 

You have found within yourself this great change that has taken place. If you indeed look back upon your life you can see the changes so obvious and powerful. And now the changes will come upon you more rapidly, my beloveds, and they will be shifts of perception, of values and focus. And your prayers will intensify, my beloveds. They will become the anchor of your life. They already are becoming so. And what will flow from this great effort to be with God will astonish you, my beloveds. The opportunities will be laid before you, the possibilities that are within you will become real and powerful gifts that will benefit mankind. Much awaits. 

Continue in your efforts to pray for this beautiful Love and acknowledge within you a fire burns, bright and hot, its warmth and healing growing within you. And you will walk this world in grace and Love and those things you fear you cannot do, you will do, you will do in the flow of God’s Love. You will reach many souls in this flow, you will walk many lands, you will span many cultures, language will not be a barrier, Love will be the currency, the way in which you will communicate to many, many beautiful souls who yearn, who long for fellowship, to be a part of something beautiful. And this simple Love will bridge all, will bring great wondrous peace.

Continue to pray often, to prepare yourselves for what is to come, to entertain the thought that you may be God’s channel of Love in this way, that there may be many possibilities awaiting you and there may be much within you that waits for your acceptance and allowing these aspects of yourselves to come forth, to come forth and manifest Light and Love, in the flow of Love and in the flow of God’s Will.

Beloved souls, you carry this Light, you carry this Truth and it is surely not a burden but a great blessing. Share this blessing with all you meet, for God has planned you to meet many. Be open, be humble, speak truth, walk in the Light and always be with God. And what I speak of will be true and manifest in wondrous and surprising ways, as you walk this world and beseech God to use you as His beautiful channels of Love. It shall be so and you will find joy, wondrous peace, bountiful blessings in this service. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Matthew and I, too, love you and I am with you in your efforts to be with God in His efforts to save your brothers and sisters from their pain and their error and the great deprivation that comes from not having love in their lives. I am with you. God bless you.
