And in your daily lives I see now how important it is to give in prayer and love to all my earthly friends as much as I can and I will, I promise you, I will be with each and every one of you who desires for me to be with you and remember Love is the most important thing, Love is the most important thing. 

Please pray for God’s Love. Please express love in everything you do. Please give as much as you can, where you can. For all of that, all of that my friends, builds a Light within you and that Light will carry on when your time comes to be on this side of life. 

And I want you all to know that you’re each a Light and you’re each loved, and everyone of you has the possibility to know the glories and the beauty and the Light that comes when your time comes close and you transition to this side of life. 

We will all show up for you, my friends. We will show up in beautiful ways. You’ll be surprised. And I am gloriously happy in the third sphere.<sup>1</sup> It is a big surprise to me and I thank God with all my heart for all that he has given me, the many blessings that I have received in my life and the wonderful friends that I have had over the years and friendships and opportunities to help others. 

Life is full of opportunities. Please know this. Know that every, every day has something where you can give to another. Thank you, thank you for allowing me to speak and I thank this instrument who has made an exception, for he has a rule about only angels (Celestials) speaking through him and I am no angel yet, but I am very happy to be here in the Light. Actually, rather surprised. Yes, life has many surprises and blessings. 

Please go forward from this meeting and think about what has been said and how glorious life is, grasp it and live it, beloved friends. Live it to the fullest. Life is meant to be lived and life is meant to be loved. God bless you, my friends, God bless you. I love you all. Your friend Lorna is with you. God bless you. Thank you.
