I am John. The world is in great need of change. The world hungers for love. The world suffers from the lack of love in mankind. Each of you has a ministry in this world to bring the Love to mankind, to demonstrate and teach the power of God’s Love. And each of you has been called by Jesus to be his disciple. 

The truth of the good news of the bestowal of the Divine Love must be taught and shared with others. It is crucial to God’s plan for the salvation of mankind and it requires your strength, capacity to love, capacity to understand the truth, to demonstrate, to speak, to have compassion for all, to walk this world unencumbered, to be a clear channel of the Father’s Love. This you must work towards, my beloved souls. This is so important, that you shed all that is not in harmony with God’s Love, that you come to truly know your souls, to truly know God’s soul, to be familiar with the flow of His Love and Will in your life, to be strong in your thoughts, to be humble in your actions, to be loving at all times. 

We would not ask this of you, beloved souls, if we thought you were incapable of living in the world in this way. But within each of you, within your souls, resides that light that is burning within. Each of you has a great capacity to love and to know God and to speak truth. And so you have been called by the Master to be his disciples, to spread this Truth in the world and when you are ready, when you have committed yourselves fully, when your eyes are open, and your souls awakened, you will move upon this Earth as bright Lights and you will join others who will take up the call to bring the Truth, to bring this Light to the world. 

Prayer, beloveds, prayer is so important. Without your time with God, without allowing God to infill your soul with His Love you cannot act as his emissaries of Love and Truth. You must live this Truth with each moment, each breath. You must be receptive to the guidance given, the promptings, the ebbs and flows of the great blessings from God through you to others. 

This is how it is done, beloved souls. It is simple but often difficult to enact in your lives as you continue to waver between the human condition and the divine impetus. But you will find your way and doors will open, Love will flow, souls will flock to you, my beloveds. They will hunger for this Love and when this Love is so powerful within that it cannot be denied, you will truly have fulfilled your purpose to bring this Truth to mankind. But do not take for granted that all this will unfold without your effort and prayer. No, my beloveds, you must make great effort. And you must not allow the negativity to overwhelm you but be confident, steadfast, bold, have faith, and have trust and nothing will harm you. 

All that is not in harmony with God’s Will, will fall away and you will truly know the joy of service for God and love, the power of God’s Will manifesting through you, the beauty of His blessings flowing, flowing unceasing. Your souls desire this, my beloveds. Your souls eagerly anticipate this chapter in your life, filled with surprises, many blessings, purposeful and guided. Days upon days as you allow these blessings to flow. Do not underestimate the power of God’s Will and His Love to transform, to heal, to make and bring into harmony all of His creation. 

Beloved souls, God’s Hand rests upon you. He sends His angels to be with you and they walk with you always. It is time to face the Light of God’s presence fully, to be in humble communion, to allow God to purposefully transform you in His Love, to bring forth the great and wondrous gifts that lie within you, to whisper His intended purpose for you, to walk in this Light. Pray, beloved souls. Pray for this, pray for His Love in all earnestness. Reach that exalted place where His Will and Love flow freely through you and you joyfully accept His purposeful guidance and loving intention to use one of His children as an instrument of His Love and change in the world. 

He has seeded your souls, beloveds. He has made your souls come alive with His Love. He has brought every good thing to your soul and your being and this shall continue to flow with ever more intensity. His Touch will become deeper and deeper within you and you will expel that which is not of His Love and absorb all that is of His Love. 

Will you walk with God, my beloveds? Will you say to God, “I am ready to make that commitment that you long for me to make”? Will you make this choice, my beloveds, to set aside your own needs so that God may use you in purposeful and unencumbered ways in this world? Are you strong enough? Are you willing enough? Are you humble enough to take this invitation to be God’s instruments in this world? 

There is nothing to fear and much to gain in acquiescing to God’s Will. But to truly understand what God’s Will is, your souls must be fully awakened by the Love, your eyes must be opened, you must be attuned to the perceptions and wisdom of your soul and you must allow His Love to flow unencumbered. 

How little time there is, my beloveds, for the world is undergoing deep change and God requires those with wisdom and strength, perception and love, to help usher the children into a new consciousness and awareness, more in harmony with His Creation. How much longer can those who know this Truth stand by the sidelines and watch? No, my beloveds, it is time to act, to be in harmony with God’s great Will and Plan. 

You feel the calling within your souls. You know the truth of this, the power of this and you cannot stand by and be swept away by these changes. You must hold fast, trusting in God, relying upon your faith, the power of your soul’s perceptions, listening to God’s Will and you will weather any storm. Anything that comes will bypass you and you will be safe. You will stand upon the rock of God’s great Will and lead others in this Truth.

Be with God, my beloved children. Come to know God as a constant presence with you and within you, and all will unfold in harmony and in Love. Follow the Light. Be in the Light. Be true to yourselves and to God. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am John and I love you and I am by your side as you continue to seek the truth. God bless you. God bless you.
