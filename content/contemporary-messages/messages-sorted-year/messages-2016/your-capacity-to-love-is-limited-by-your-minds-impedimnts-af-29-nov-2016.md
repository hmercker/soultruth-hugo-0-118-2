It is Andrew.

How much joy it gives to us in spirit to see you. You have come together in this way with a deep desire for harmony and love and peace amongst you and with that eagerness to pray, that desire to receive the holy blessing of the Father’s Love within your souls. 

Your capacity to love is only limited by your mind’s conception of what that is, for you have a great capacity to love and all that stands in the way of this immense flood of love that can and will come through you, my beloveds, into this world, is your thought that you are unworthy, or that you are not loved, or that you cannot love. For you can love, that love resides within your souls, it resides in wonderful abundance and is eager to burst forth through each one of you in wonderful ways. And some accept this and are not so entrapped by the limitations of the mind and they do indeed give love in beautiful ways. 

Each of you does, in your own way, give love and each of you seeks to reach to a higher place as you incrementally grow in your capacity to love, as you continue to release those barriers within, as you open to the understanding and the power of this great gift and to God’s Will that flows to you. God gives you much, and so much awaits to be given, for you to accept, to allow, to desire this great gift and all that comes with it. For much will be given in the flow of this Love, great truths, wonderful guidance, a surety within you that is beyond anything that your mind can give you. It is a strength and faith that is born of love, the Divine Love, with all its special qualities, all its active aspects which awaken your souls and open your eyes to the truth of your life, and of all life of God’s Creation.

One cannot truly see without the eyes of the soul, one cannot truly know without the capacity of the soul awakened by the Love. In this way all those desires to serve, to bring about light in this world, to bring healing to this world are possible. Because you allowed your soul to expand and grow and take precedence within your being so that God may use you in a clear way, a powerful way to do the work that He has in store for each one of you as part of His plan for the salvation of mankind. 

To have willing workers, equipped with a soul awakened, fully healed in love, whose capacities and potentials begin to emerge in this blessed state of Grace my, what you would be capable of, my beloveds, how powerful would be your presence in the world, what a magnificent example of truth you will become.

Beautiful souls, trusting in God and His Will, feeling and knowing the power of His Love, becoming aware of your own personal capacities and gifts, all illuminated by God’s Love,  so you creep towards this goal. Bit by bit incrementally you will rise up above your own human condition and the condition of this world, desiring to be in the world but not of this world. Your souls are eager, your desire is to serve, to be a clear channel for God. My beloveds, you will continue up this ladder to that lofty place and you will serve God in powerful ways, beyond your imagination at this time, but you must release those vestiges of a life without God to a place where you are with God in every way, with each day. You are further along this journey than you may think and you will within your lives my beloveds, each of you, come to that place of beautiful grace, of wonderful service; and being a clear channel of God’s Love in this world. 

And we who love you and serve God and serve you in love will continue to support and carry you through the difficult times to a place of opening and peace and powerful presence in love. Yes, my beloveds, you are carried, you are loved, you are given all that you require to climb to that place of purity. May each one of you come to truly understand and accept and desire this invitation given by God to be with him in this light and Love.

God bless you beloveds. I am Andrew, I love you dearly, I am with you, I am with you as one who loves you dearly. God bless you.
