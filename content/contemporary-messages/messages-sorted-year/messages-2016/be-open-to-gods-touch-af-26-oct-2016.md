It is so good to see so many who’ve come from different perspectives, understandings yet have a soul longing to come together in a group such as this, to receive this great blessing of God’s Divine Love. And I would urge each one of you here to put aside your expectations that are born of your mental ideas and go deeper to that place of your soul, that place is a place separate and different from your mind. It is a place with many hidden potentials and has the possibility to be close to God, for it is your soul that is the image of God, my beloveds. It is your soul that is able to truly know God and to recognize the blessing of His Love which is the essence of the Creator. 

Be at peace and know that with each one of you stands an angel and with each one will come a blessing as you open, as you are earnest and pray for this opening of Love. It will come. It will come as a great river, flowing into your being, carrying you to God, bringing great blessings of peace and comfort, healing and Love.

Be open, be open and receive what God has to give you, for each and every one of you is worthy, is precious and beautiful. Each one of you is able to receive this gift as long as you allow this Touch from God to enter within you, this Holy Touch that shall change your being, enlighten your souls and bring revelation to your consciousness. It does not come all at once, my beloveds. It comes with each prayer, each longing you make to God and this will set you upon a road, distinct and beautiful and full of wondrous things, openings, understandings, carrying you close to the fountainhead of God’s Great Love and Being. 

Be open, accept what is given, ask God to give to you what your souls deeply long for, what is meant to be given and you shall surely receive and know this Gift. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine and I am happy to be with you this night in this beautiful circle of beautiful souls. God bless you.
