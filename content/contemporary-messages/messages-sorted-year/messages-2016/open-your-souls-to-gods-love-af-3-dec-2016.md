Thank you for gathering here this day. Thank you for saying the prayer for the Father’s Love, for indeed, you all are the objects of the tenderest care and ministrations and I would ask you all to seek love above all else and to bring within your beings, your souls that touch of Divine Love. 

Feel it’s beautiful and priceless touch within you that none can describe completely for in order to know it you must experience it. May you all experience this touch of love, may you all seek it with that yearning from your souls and in this touch you begin a journey that lasts for all eternity for this love may be blessed to you over and over again for all eternity, my beloveds. A great expansion, an infilling into your souls transforming, healing, bringing you ever closer to the Father’s embrace and showing of the way to atonement, atonement with God. 

God bless you beloved souls, seek this truth, seek this love and I assure you that you will open doors of wonderment, doors of beauty, doors filled with light. It is your choice, beloved souls, it is a gift offered to you and it is our fervent desire that you grasp this gift, that you open to this opportunity for it is simple, it takes little time, it takes but a sincere effort and it will indeed change your life, given enough of this blessing within you.

God bless you and thank you for allowing me to speak. I am Matthew and I inhabit the Celestial Kingdom and I love you. God bless you.
