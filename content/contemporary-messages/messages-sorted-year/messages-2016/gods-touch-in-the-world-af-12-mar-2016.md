It is John. So you see how God works in your lives and there are times when God works in ways that are readily perceived, but God is working in your lives every moment, my beloveds. Every moment He Touches your life; He leads the way into Light; He opens doors, and opportunities. His invitation is always there, my beloveds, to receive His Love, to listen to His Voice, to be guided, to be shown the way, and to be  embraced fully by your Heavenly Father whose love for you is greater than all the love of the angels, and all the love that you perceive in the world. It is greater, a mighty force in this universe, and in your life. God’s Love carries you, embraces you, and keeps you within this Light of His presence. 

I know there are times when you do not feel this Love, but it is there, always embracing, enfolding, healing, and working within you. It is there in every moment. It is there for all eternity, my beloveds, each one of you carries this flame of Love and it will never be diminished. It will never be diminished but only grow brighter, stronger, changing you, and informing your efforts. It is your constant companion and reminder that you are a child of God and God has embraced you and brought you into the Light of the Divine Path. There is no turning back for any of you but only moving forward, continuing in your efforts, seeking the guidance, and increasing your capacity to love in the world. As also your capacity to perceive the Heavenly Father, and your capacity to love yourselves so that you shall continue to move forward as the changes in the world compel you to act as God’s instruments in this world. Each day will help you to move forward, my beloveds, as the angels surround you, as you are in His Grace, as you are inspired and compelled to do God’s bidding, and to be that channel of Love wherever you are. So whatever you do, and even as you pray together in a group, as you enfold others in this Circle of Light you cause ripples in the world, ripples that will bring change, ripples that will assist the changes that are inevitable in this world. 

Remember this, my beloveds, whenever you pray, whenever you put your loving intentions together and send them to God you are causing change, you are bringing Light, you are touching other souls. Though you are not aware, this is happening in your world through the power of your prayers, the intensity of your longings and the responding Touch from God This is your greatest resource, my beloveds, a prayer reaching God, being that channel for God, your greatest resource and many do not understand this, do not acknowledge this but within their souls they feel it and this is how change happens, true change happens by touching the souls of your brothers and sisters as God’s channels, as God’s instruments. You must see things from this perspective, that it is your prayers, your loving intent as you move in the world, as you create Circles of Light, as you draw in those who are curious and cry out for Love, and you enfold them and show them the power of prayer. Love them and direct their eyes to God as the great source of all Love. 

Beloveds, you will touch many souls and in many ways that you will not be aware. But indeed, you have all committed yourselves to be that channel, to be that touch which is God’s Touch in the world. Do not wander but move forward in Love. Intensify your prayers, enfold the world in your prayers and be God’s channels of Love. God bless you. I am John and I love you.
