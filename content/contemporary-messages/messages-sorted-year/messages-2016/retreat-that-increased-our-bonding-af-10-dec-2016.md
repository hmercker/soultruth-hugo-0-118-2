God bless you beloved souls. You have accomplished much upon this short journey together and the shifts and blessings and new awarenesses have come to you as you have sought the Father’s Love. You have come to that place of communion, of togetherness and fellowship and now you are more deeply bonded together because of what you have shared simply bound together. In this bonding, this deeper fellowship will come a flowering of many blessings not only for you individually and collectively but a sort of channel for the world to bring blessings through to many. You will walk together for all eternity, my beloveds, upon this journey to atonement with God. And you will continue to grow in the love, your souls will flourish in the love, your beings will find that great balance and wholeness in the love. 

As you have prayed that your soul will take precedence over your mind, this will come. You will be transformed by the Holy Blessing of the Father’s Love. As you continue to pray for that great blessing many more changes will come within you, with shifts and understandings. And yes you will come together again and again in various forms, groups, and pray together. God will use this light, this collective prayer with the power of what you generate together with God and with the angels that will be used to flood this world with light, and to flood this world with love. 

Remember these days together and when you feel alone. Think of your companions, think of those who love you, draw them into your consciousness and you will feel the deep peace and comfort that has come with your prayers together at this time. Many blessings come in many different forms. With this bond between your souls you now have access to more powerful channels of love to support you. 

So, my beloveds, be together in your hearts. Love one another and keep one another alive within your awareness, your prayers. Allow the bonds of love to have their benefits for one another. And these bonds, this circle will grow. Many are coming, many will feel the power of this light generated. Many will come to know you as someone that they can trust and listen to, be comforted by and you will give this simple truth in love and you will envelope in love, and you will allow God to work through you in love. 

We are pleased that you have come together and you have listened to the teachings, you have prayed in powerful ways, you have spoken your truth, you have shared your love, and you have generated a great light.

Beloveds, this gift from God, this time together is given freely in love because God envelopes you and his care for you is deep, abiding, encompassing and you’ve answered his call to come together - his children wrapped in light - brought close to the bosom, succoured with love and truth. Remember that God is always close. These blessings and benefits can come to each one of you in prayer. You are meant to be close to God, to feel what you feel now, to be free of those anxieties and worries and cares of the material world. That you carry within you a deep peace, a powerful light, a beautiful knowledge of love. Protect this light always and grow this light every day and you will walk with joy, with the power of truth, and the world of love, a connection with God that does not falter but grows with each day.

You are loved, my beloveds, truly know this, bring this love deep within you and acknowledge how beautiful you are, love yourselves as God loves you, love others as God loves you, be in the flow of his love always. And I love you, beloveds, I am Andrew and I am with you in this great love. 

God bless you.
