Dear, beloved and precious souls, I am Confucius. Each of you have been drawn here because your souls wish to unite together in prayer, to know this fellowship and to be in this Light. Always acknowledge the power of your soul’s desires, my beautiful souls, and acknowledge the power of God in your lives and how you may be touched by this powerful hand of Love and healing and peace. And each soul, no matter the conditions which they find themselves in or must deal with in this world, has the possibility to ascend into Light, to receive the healing that they need and to bring the wisdom required, to bring harmony into their lives and the potential to bring harmony into the lives of those around them. But it is important, my beloveds, to set your intention for Light, to be an example of Light, to be strong within your souls, to be close to God always. For in this relationship with the Creator, in this beautiful flow of Love that comes from God, you are able to surmount all difficulties, to not allow the human condition that is so difficult and heavy, negative and chaotic to overwhelm you when you are in the flow of God’s Love, and when you are open to this Gift of His presence within you and about you. 

Yes, you come together because you feel a deep need for healing and respite, healing and peace, healing and harmony. And I say to you, beloved, beautiful souls, it is freely given to all those who ask no matter where you are, no matter what condition you see yourself beset with. This Gift will be given to those who sincerely ask in prayer. It is available freely. It is always given. But I see how difficult it is when you feel overwhelmed and burdened and you are in pain and you see the pain of those you love. And you ask why? Why must my loved one suffer so? Why must I suffer so? And I say there is always a way out of your suffering and to cleanse yourselves from these conditions which so beset humanity. But it does take your efforts, your resolution and commitment to be close to your Creator, always. And in this will flow all that you require to push back the darkness, to be in that Light, to be free from that which burdens you and to give love, to give healing as God’s channels in the world, for those you love, for those in the world who are in need. 

Yes, you all come to God in times of need and this is good. This is good. But you must forge up a powerful relationship with your Creator so that you become unassailable to the dark forces which are active in this world, that conspire to make misery and pain. And you must build your fortress of Light. You must be in the flow of God’s Love. You must take time, each and every day in prayer and gratitude, beseeching your Heavenly Father to receive this Gift of Light within you and all about you, so that all that which conspires to pull you into darkness has no power upon you. 

And each and every one in this circle is a soul of Light and has great intentions to be a channel of Love for others. And I say to you, beloved souls, that when you are in this Light and when your soul glows with this Light and when you serve mankind as each and every one of you does in your own way, you become a target for negativity and you must ensure that you are protected and strong in Light and not vulnerable to these negative forces which creep up upon you in unexpected ways, through avenues unanticipated, from individuals whom you trust at times, for they too, can be vulnerable to the negativity. You must understand that there are many forces that conspire in many different ways, on many different levels to draw you out of the Light, my beloveds. It is important to understand this, each and every day, not in a way of fear, not in a way that you mistrust or that you anticipate pain but in a way that you reinforce the Light within yourselves through prayer and faith, through the strength of your spirit, through the gifts that each one of you possess, through the wisdom that you have within your souls and to be close to God, knowing His Will in your life. 

Beloved souls, in this flow when you are aligned with God even though the conditions of chaos and pain are all about you, you will be a steady hand in the middle of the storm. You will not be assailed and pulled down into this chaos, but you will be able to bring harmony and love, the strength that comes with wisdom, knowing that God guides you and that you are His channel of Love in this world. And the world does need such channels at this time. The world needs your Lights. The world needs your wisdom. The world plunges into darkness and is seeking a way from these conditions to find a road to Light away from the dilemmas and the pain, the error and such untruth that brings chaos. 

Each of you is capable, is strong, is beautiful and is loving. You must see this within yourselves to know the beauty that is your own creation, your own being, your own strength, your own Light and your own capacity to love. And be firm in this for each of you will continue to be needed in this world and you need to be strong, for many rely upon you, each one of you and your strength and your love. You do not often see the impact that you have as you walk in this world, how you do indeed touch other souls with your presence and Light, in subtle ways often but in powerful ways, always. 

Continue to see your way through the forest into that lighted glade of peace and tranquility, of Love and Light, of God’s Presence enveloping you and bringing you peace and reassurance. Each has gifts to give and each shall be given Gifts from God. 

Walk in your Light, beloved souls and do not pander to negativity or error but walk in your truth and be in the truth of God’s Love always and you will find that these conditions which upset you so will fall away and you will find this liberation that you seek and joy in your heart and Love in your soul so precious to God, so precious to the angels and a Light walking amongst mankind. Never forget this, you are a Light and you are strong. God bless you. Confucius loves you and I am with you when you are in pain, when you cry out. I am with you and many angels seek to bring you comfort and healing and grace. God bless you.
