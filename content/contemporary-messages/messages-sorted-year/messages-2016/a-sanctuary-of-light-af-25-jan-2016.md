Unity Church Kailua, Hawaii, U.S.A 

Received by Al Fike.


God bless you, dear souls, who gather in Light, and whose souls are earnest and seek Truth and earnestly live Truth in their lives. Do you acknowledge the far reaching impact you have by doing this, my beloveds? That every action that you take, every gift of love that you give, has a ripple effect in the world bringing greater Light, bringing a kindness, love, healing to many, and how important this is, my beloveds, to act in this way in your daily lives, to walk in this Light, to be in God’s Grace. And you create here a sanctuary, a place of Light, a place where you may replenish yourselves, a place where God has touched this very ground with His blessing. It is a fountainhead of nourishment for your souls. It is where His Love may reign supreme, in this place. It is a gift from God and you, my beloveds, through your prayers, through your actions, through your efforts, through your intentions, through your love, you have created a sanctuary of Light. 

And God wishes for you to maintain this place of Light, to draw in those who are in need, to welcome those who come through your threshold. Be that channel of Light, my beloveds, be that channel of Light and walk your Path of Light, giving love, seeking Love, for God’s Love will pour into your souls in endless abundance if you but ask, if you open this door within you and say: “Dear Creator, I wish to receive Your Essence into my soul, I wish to walk this Path of Your Love. I wish to be a channel of Your Love in the world”. And in this you will enter the mighty flow of God’s Love and be His channels of Love and walk in this Grace that is God’s Grace. 

Know that you walk in Light. Do not allow those who would denigrate you and call you down, to have any effect upon your being and know that you walk a Path that is righteous and beautiful and full of Grace. Walk this beautiful Path and the angels will walk with you and help you upon your way, guiding and protecting, supporting you in your efforts to not only make your life more beautiful and in harmony with God, but to make this world more in harmony with God. 

Beloved souls, carry on in your efforts. Serve others through what you refer to as ‘right action’, a channel of Love. And be at peace for the hand of God is upon you. And you are with God in your desire that comes from your soul to be in alignment with this Divine Grace, Divine Will, Divine Love.
Beloveds, I am with you, I am Peter and I am with you in your efforts, God bless you.
