Each of you will be blessed upon your travels returning home and these blessings that you have obtained through your time together have created shifts within your souls and this will reflect within your lives as you carry it within your life, as the flow of your life unfolds in the light of God’s care and touch. 

There is much work to do, my beloveds, so much will be required of each one of you as you continue to discover the purpose which lies within your souls, the will of God manifesting through your persons. Much will manifest as long as you are able to not obscure the flow of God’s will within you and through you. It takes a strength, a strength of faith, a trust in God’s Will, a willingness to step beyond your comfort zone, to walk in this world as God’s instrument.

You have all seen examples of this in your lives. How a dear and bright soul is willing to follow their guidance, to step forth as a channel of God’s Love, to enact God’s Will and blessings to those around them and they do so because they allow their day to unfold in the flow of God’s Love, they trust in that beautiful flow, they’re inspired by God, guided by God. Much is accomplished in this way and it is a somewhat unorthodox way of life. Some will be puzzled by your motivations and actions but pay them no heed, my beloveds. Know that God has you firmly in His grasp and will guide you through. You will not suffer, you will know no lack of deprivation, you will be free in the light, in the flow of God and his intentions for you and for those around you. And I dare say in many ways you will be honored for your efforts, acknowledged and respected for your willingness to go beyond your needs and look at the needs of others and attend to those needs in loving ways, to be strong in love, to be wise in love, to be generous in love. Follow your hearts, my beloveds, for within your hearts lies the beating will of God and His Love, outpouring, manifesting, healing, comforting, enveloping. 

You need not worry when you return to your homes for with God uplifting you, that which has been a challenge will become easier, you will manage and many other doors will open for you. Express your beautiful selves in creative, loving, powerful ways in the world. 

This does not mean that the conditions of the world will cease to be enacted around you. No, my beloveds, you are in the world but your attachments to those conditions, your reactions, concerns and worries and fears will begin to fall away and you will walk with a new stride that is enlivened with joy and deep wisdom and a loving demeanor. All will unfold as it should. Be comforted, my beloved brothers and sisters, that you have indeed entered a new phase in your spiritual life and in this way it will be reflected in your material life, in all aspects of your life.

Be at peace and know that God has you firmly in His grasp and will guide you forth in ways yet unanticipated and unimagined but will be so, and doors that seem firmly closed at this time will open. Opportunities which you have not even dreamed of will be placed before you. It is for you to have your eyes opened, to recognize what God lays before you and it is for you to be strong enough to take up the challenge which God lays before you. For when God entreats you to act on His behalf, this is not a trifling matter nor an easy task. No, my beloveds, it requires you to grow, to grow within this flow, this task of love, to stretch beyond what is comfortable, to acknowledge that the power of God’s Love, His blessings, will support you in the work which he will entrust you with. And I would advise you not to formulate plans and ideas that are purely of your mental imaginations’ and ambitions. 

You are now asked to operate from your soul. To be God’s instruments in this world. To walk in that light, fully, without fear, without doubt, without judgement, to trust, to trust in a greater way, an elevated perspective which will show each step as it is required to manifest in your life. And remember, when God has his hand upon you and your life and the enfolding of your life all will come into place in harmony and it will flow as you are willing to accept what is laid before you as you go within yourselves and acknowledge the rightness, the harmony of that particular step as you choose to step forward and do so in joy and anticipation, excitement for what is to come.
Those who are firmly entrenched in this world will not understand, they will be puzzled, they will try to draw you away from these choices, these actions blessed by God. You must bless them in love and for those you love who will be afraid of your choices, you must ask God to enfold them and care for them, bring them into harmony and alignment with His Will. 

These will be the challenges, my beloveds, for as you shift and change and it becomes more evident in your life those who look to you, rely upon you and are comforted by who you are in this material and human way must adjust and see you from a different perspective as you see your life from a different perspective. This does not mean that your life will become chaos and those about you and who rely on you and who love you will be hurt and distraught and you will sacrifice your love for the love of God, no this is not the case. All will be blessed in a guided life that is harmony. 

So you are not worry but to accept the unfolding of your life blessed by God, to take that risk and to walk forward fully conscious of the choices you are making and how to make those choices that are in harmony with the world around you in this way. And God will help you in this way you will not cause a ripples of hurt or pain, you will bring those who are with you along into that greater light, you will show the way in loving, beautiful, expressions of God’s Will and each follows a road which is unique to them. It is for you to discover your particular road, to know that you are on the right road. To be in harmony with God and His Will and the flow of His Love upon that road. It will unfold. 

There is always a timing and a knowing in greater ways, deeper ways what is meant to be. It will unfold and all will be as God plans for the salvation of mankind. Each of you have a place in this plan, a role to play, for some there will dramatic changes in your life and for others this will be more subtle. 

God will not push you beyond that point of breaking, no, my beloveds, but He encourages you to reach beyond your present understanding, to change those behaviours that are not of His Love, to go deeper within yourselves so that you may release those conditions within you that are not in harmony with His Love. And in all these ways your lives will change in inevitable way for as you change within so there shall be changes without. As you continue to grow in the Love so your perceptions change, so your capacities to love, to be a channel of God’s Love are deepened and expanded. 

Life is change and with change comes growth and with growth comes change. This is a law and it is part of the law of God’s Love. Transformation, release, healing, revelations, deeper understandings, parts of yourselves which you are not even aware are within you will emerge. Beautiful, beautiful gifts. Your eyes will open and you will be guided by God and in this you will know such a deep fulfilment, a resounding joy that you will look back and think “why, why did I take so long to come to that place, that place of service, that place of joy and understanding, of Love manifest in every part of my being and my life?” Yet you are human and this does indeed take its time, its pacing to overcome the challenges that each of you face within your lives. But you have come together at this time to support one another in this inevitable evolution of your souls. To be free of the encumbrances of your souls and to enact the bounteous, beautiful gifts within on behalf of God, harmonized with His Will, His desire for you to bring light and comfort, truth and joy to all those you meet. 

Continue, my beloved beautiful friends, upon your journeys of awakening and loving and being in the light. We are ever with you, never to leave, always to be in support and love. It is our delight to see you emerge, to grow in the light, to be those beautiful souls which God has implanted within each one of you, unique and truly cherished. It begins with this day, this moment, this awakening, coming further to that place of daylight, truth, harmony, love that comes ever closer. You are well on your way. And may God bless you with every step. We love you, are with you. God bless you.
