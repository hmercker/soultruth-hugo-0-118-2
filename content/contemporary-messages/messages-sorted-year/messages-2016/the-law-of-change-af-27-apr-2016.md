May the Divine Love find a deep inflowing to your souls, my friends, and may you continue to come together in these Circles of Light, of prayer for Love. How important they are in this world and how few there are in this world that pray for the Father’s Love in such a direct way. Connecting with God in this way brings powerful Light and all that comes with this Love and Light brings powerful change within you, beloved souls. It also brings the opportunity for we in spirit to come close to all of you, those who are just beginning upon this Path and those who are my old friends. Yes, we have journeyed a great distance, praying together, working together, allowing God’s Will to manifest through us, each one of us working His Will into our lives and us learning to allow His Will to manifest unimpeded, allowing His Love to change us. 

Do not resist change, beloveds, for change will happen whether you resist or not, it will happen. Change is always happening. And when God’s Hand is upon these changes, it is for the better. There is growth, there comes something different that will bring greater Light. There is greater harmony and peace. God’s changes, His desire for the world to change, for you, beloved souls, to change is ever present and it is but for you to ask, to be open, to allow and to be on side with these changes, to be strong and have faith and to be at peace with God’s Will.
 
So much change is still to come. There is much coming for each one of you and you must be ready to accept and to walk with these changes and to not resist. For when you resist, then comes the pain, but as you go with the flow of change which in your hearts and in your souls you know it is right, then there will be no pain but a rejoicing for what will come, an acceptance and an opening of doors unanticipated and surprising. For with change comes new opportunities, change brings growth and greater life. Change brings new things within yourselves. Change is a law of the universe and no matter how much you wish things to stay the same, this cannot be so. In a blink of an eye everything can change. And it is that security that you find with God, that Love that is within your souls, that knowingness within yourselves that gives you the strength, the stability to weather any change in this world whether that be outside of yourselves or inside of yourselves. You will have the strength and you will have the perspective to be able to accept and to grow with change. It will come as it does inevitably as you grow older in your lives, as the people who are in your lives change, as some leave and some enter into your lives. And then there are those opportunities that God places before you to take, to grasp a hold of, to risk change, something new, something that could be very important and life changing, not only for yourselves but for those around you as well. It is important to be willing to change, to change the patterns of your old life, to change many things, material things, ways of thinking and ways of doing. 

Yes, my beloveds, the key to growth is change. The key to growth is to embrace whatever changes God deems as correct for your lives and for your path in this world. And His Love will always allow you to be open and to perceive and to embrace these changes that are meant to be. It is the power of this Love that will make these changes fluid and they will not be painful but joyous and welcomed and full and rich. 

Beloved souls, continue to pray for the Love, the Love that opens doors, the Love that transforms you, the Love that will give you the vision to accept many changes in your life and you will know a joy, a fulfilment, great differences from what you are today to what you will be tomorrow. Many changes ahead with lots to come. My beloved friends, I am with you often. I am with you and will be with you through any and all changes and events in your lives, because I am your true friend and helper and I love you. I am Alec and I love you. God bless you.
