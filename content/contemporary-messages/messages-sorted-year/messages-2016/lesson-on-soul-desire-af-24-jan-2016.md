# Lesson on Soul-desire


January 24<sup>th</sup>, 2016

Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike.


I am your teacher Augustine. God bless you, my children. It is important to know the desire of your soul, for the desire of your soul may be quite different from the desires of your mind. And often you are in conflict when these two sets of desires do not match. 

A soul that desires Love, God’s Love, may be thwarted by a mind that does not feel worthy of this Love. And a mind may think that it is receiving God’s Love where there is not a true desire in the soul. You must plumb the depths of your souls, my beloveds, and come to know your true soul desires and to make this the focus of your prayers. 

To bring yourselves into alignment with God you must bring forth your soul desire, with all the intensity and clarity that you can muster, my beloveds. Do not be confused. Do not allow your minds to obscure the desire of your soul. Yet this is so often the case. The mind filters, obstructs, denies, questions. And along with your thinking and thoughts come emotions of unworthiness, hurt, fear. It is important that you set these aside, that you discipline the wayward conditions of your minds and allow your souls to truly commune with your Heavenly Father. For each of you and all of humanity are quite capable of communing with God. 

And what is it that holds you back, my beloveds? What is the greatest hurdle? It is your mind, your material mind that is so cluttered and filled with all the material experiences and thoughts and all of those elements that have been poured into your minds over your lifetimes, much of which has nothing to do with God and everything to do with the human condition. And this creates quite a struggle in each one of you, my beloveds, to tame the fires of your material minds, the conditions, those aspects within you that are out of harmony with the laws of God’s Love. And that requires effort on your part, my beloveds, to side step, to put away these conditions and to truly go to God in prayer, to express the true desires of your soul, to pray to God with all your heart, with all your feeling, with all your words, or with no words at all but pure longing going to the Creator.

You must do this, my beloveds. And at times you do accomplish this and at times you divert the desires of your souls and it does not hit its mark. Be aware of those times when you do not feel the connection with God when you are praying. Come to know the conditions within yourselves which thwart your efforts. Be true to yourselves, be honest. For every moment is a choice. 

Every moment comes a thought, a deed, an interaction, a condition built and you must seek for the highest, my beloveds. Seek to build the conditions within you that create the powerful connection with God to affirm this truth within you, my beloveds. You cannot pretend, there is no pretension in this, for you know within yourselves when you are close to God and you know within yourselves when you are not. And this does not mean that you should condemn yourselves when you do not feel this connection, more that you should go deeper within yourselves. Go deeper, feel love for yourself and all of those whom you love, and all of humanity and all of creation. It is so important to feel that feeling of Love, that clear Light that is not hampered by the conditions of this world, that clear desire that is so true to your souls. 
So much depends upon your effort to put aside these human conditions and to accentuate and acknowledge and nurture the desires of your soul. 

Beloveds, continue in your prayers. Seek the Heavenly Father with all your heart. Do not allow that which resides in you and in all of humanity, to thwart your efforts to be with God, but to ask God to remove these conditions, to help you to be strong and disciplined, to help you to pray with earnestness and true soul longing, that you may reach God who longs for you to be with Him, who longs for this connection. Just as you long to be with Him, He longs to be with you, the communing of souls, His great soul and your soul, beautiful, precious, that longs so deeply and craves the Father’s Love.

Beloveds, be in this flow of Love. Be with God. Love yourselves and rise above the conditions of this world to a place of joy, fulfilment, true soul awareness, true Love Divine. Beloveds, be with God for God is with you.
God bless you, your teacher Augustine loves you and is with you in your prayers, in your efforts and all the angels support you in this and pray with you and help you to clear away these conditions that hamper your prayers and stunt your longings. God bless you, I love you. God bless you.
