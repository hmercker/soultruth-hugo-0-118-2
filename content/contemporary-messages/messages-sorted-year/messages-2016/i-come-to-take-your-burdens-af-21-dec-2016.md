I have come to take your burdens, my beloveds. I have come to bring you love and I have come to ask the Heavenly Father to lay His hand richly upon you that He may bless you with the bounty of His Love, with the bounty of His peace, the glory that comes with this touch from God. And those of you who have journeyed have been richly blessed and those who have come this day have been blessed also, for when you step forward, you all step forward, my beloveds. There is no distance between you. The blessings of the Heavenly Father continue to flow to you and as those who pray for you continue to reach for the Heavenly Father, so you are all blessed in this beautiful network of Light, these wonderful bonds that are created between you in your prayers and your loving, your giving to one another, setting forth your intentions to God, setting forth your desire to love one another, to be in that Light, the Light that reflects God’s Love. 

Blessings to you, my beloveds, in this time may you know joy. May you be reflective of God’s Love wherever you go, to be a channel of His Love to those you meet. Remember the true meaning of this time. It was and is the beginning of the rebirth of the soul through Love. Remember this, beloveds: God has given you that great and precious gift, that highest of blessings, that His Essence may pour into your souls, beloveds, and change you forever and bring to you the great liberation from your pain and darkness, your troubles and your fears, that you may walk in the world and in the world to come, in that joyous knowing that your Heavenly Father and you are one. And from this pours the strength, the faith, the sure knowledge of your own beauty and your own person. As your soul expands in the Love you will come to truly know yourselves and come to know how God loves you with such depth, breadth, such beauty and Light. He will touch you again and again as you continue to reach for this succour of Light in your souls and you will carry upon the path towards Him, at-onement, the glory of the soul redeemed in Love. 

Yes, you come together to be in this Light and God provides to you a place, a shelter, a sanctuary, this blessing. And this shall continue to be. You shall always know this sheltering and blessing, for God desires that His children come together in this way to seek His Love, His Truth, His Blessings. And remember no matter where you are, you are with God and no matter where you are, you are with one another in this Light. 

Journey forth and know that God has His Hand upon you and shall never release you from His embrace, will carry you through your lives, will show you the wonderment of His Creation, will provide for you, my beloveds, the opportunity to serve in love, to grow in love, to understand the power and the glory of Love as it transforms you and transforms this world. 

Carry this blessing with you wherever you go, a lantern in the dark and God will send His angels to be with you, to support you, to work through you as an expression of His wondrous Will and Plan for the salvation of mankind. Gifts will be given, doors will be opened, Light will shine upon all. You will be blessed. You are blessed. Beloveds, beloveds, God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
