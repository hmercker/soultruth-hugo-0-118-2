Your teacher Augustine has come to speak to you in your prayers and in your longings to be in the Light. 

Yes, beloved students, you all struggle in your own ways to be in the Light, to find greater harmony within yourselves, to bring greater harmony in your life and to bring greater love to all those in your life. And the Love grows within your souls, beloved students. You long for greater insight, deeper understanding and relief from that human condition that resides within you and all about you, for the world is full of dark influences, turmoil and error and so you struggle against this. You, in your own ways, make great effort to keep your head above water, to be in the Light, to be with God and there is no greater way to do so than in prayer, to be with God in your quiet prayers, your soul longings, your desire to receive His Love, and to be in that flow of peace and Love. And so you gather together to reinforce this Light, this respite from the human condition, and you come together to acknowledge with one another your journeys towards Light, towards Truth, towards God, creating this Circle of Light, this place where you are not bothered by those distractions that keep you away from God. 

Beloved souls, you must redouble your efforts, your prayers. You must make greater effort to be in the Light, to be with God and you must choose to be loving in all that you do, in your thoughts and the conditions which you choose to engage with. Ask to be used as a channel of Love and Light, always, beloved souls. For in this practice, this discipline, and this effort to walk in the Light, to be engaged with others in loving ways and to engage with yourselves in loving ways, you counteract the human condition that surrounds you. And so you counteract and you make efforts to heal those conditions within yourselves that you carry from a life lived in this world and those conditions inherited by your incarnation into this world. And this as you well know is healed with the Father’s Love. And much falls away from you as you pray for this blessing of Love, as you long for the Light and deep and profound peace within. 

Beloved souls we are with you. We walk with you. We pray with you. We exert our influence upon you so that you may not be overwhelmed by these earthly conditions. We support you when you choose Light, when you make an effort and prayers to bring the Light within your lives and yourselves. For a law is enacted by these prayers when you earnestly long for the Father’s Love and so you bring the angels close, you bring this Light that pushes back the darkness, and you bring this Love that changes your inner being. And for you, my students, your greatest challenge is to control your thoughts, to bring within your thinking more positive realities and expressions, to be more in alignment with your true selves, your souls, and in alignment with the spiritual thinking that will assist you in your efforts to progress within your souls. 

Yes, it is a great commitment. You must live this in every part of your lives, and as you do so, as you apply yourselves, as you allow the error to fall away, as you allow the loving thoughts and expressions to be more predominant within your being and yourselves and all that you do in this world, you come ever closer to alignment with God. Your Light grows in this way. The Love flows more freely in this way, and as your souls expand in this Love you are compelled to express love in your lives and your beings. Its influence becomes powerful and encompasses your thinking, your feelings, and your expressions and thoughts which become transformed as your soul is transformed. This core of your being that emanates Light influences all. And in time these struggles which you have, these conditions that you deal with each and every day will dissipate to the point where they will not affect you as they do and you will be strong and wise and loving and free. You will feel a deep joy. Wisdom will flow from you and you will help others come to this place of freedom, of joy, of redemption. 

Yes, it comes in increments, in fits and starts, and there are times when you revert back to old patterns, thoughts which are negative. But, my beloveds, you continue to inch your way forward and with each choice for Light you reinforce this Path, you make it easier for you to make this choice. 

Continue, my beloved students to walk the Path of Love, to aspire for Light, to express yourselves in Love, and to be close to God and foremost to long for His Love, which will bring all that you desire within yourselves and your lives. It must be so because the power of God’s Love brings harmony, brings Light and Peace. And you desire this, beloved souls. It will come. It is coming and flowing into your souls at this very moment and you will continue to elicit this blessing, an inch ever forward to that eventual goal of at-onement with your Creator.
 
Bless you, beloved souls, on this journey, a journey which we take together, a journey full of discovery, uncovering your true selves, knowing in a deep and rich way your beloved Creator and what He has created in you. God bless you, beloveds, your teacher Augustine is always with you, helping you to learn and to grow, to pray and to feel this joy. Bless you. I love you. God bless you.
