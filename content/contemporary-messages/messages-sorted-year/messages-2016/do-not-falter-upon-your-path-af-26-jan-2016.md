God bless you, I am John, known as John the Beloved.
Open your souls beloveds to God’s Touch. Feel Him draw you up beyond the conditions of this Earth to a place of deep peace and wondrous presence and allow the Holy Spirit to place within you all the Gifts of Love that God has to give you, my beloveds. 

Do not falter upon your path, do not doubt that God is guiding you ever forward, do not worry for your material well-being, do not seek to place your will before the Will of God but to seek out God’s Will in every breath of your life. In this search, in this prayer to God to know His Will, to be and have your life within His Being, you will find the answers to all of your questions, and you will find that magical door that will open, that will present to you your purpose which God has put within each of you, my beloveds. Each of you has a unique and special purpose to fulfil in this world and this world is fast approaching times of deep change and transition, a healing for this world and for humanity. And each of you have been called to be an instrument for change, a channel of Love, a speaker of wisdom and Truth, and each of you has unique gifts which will be utilized by your Heavenly Father to help those around you to adjust to this transition and to be informed as to God’s plan for the salvation of mankind. 

Beloved souls, you find yourselves in the unique position, unique, for so few in this world seek to be used in this way. Despite each soul having a purpose, very few souls come to realize this while on Earth. Beloveds, walk your path, walk your path in faith, in strength, in peace, in joy. Walk your path with your eyes open, the eyes of your soul, that you may discern God’s Will for you, my beloveds, and that you may walk in this Light and Grace and flow of Love, so that you may come to know what it is that you are meant to do in this world. And in this knowing and the fulfilling of this knowing you will have the deepest joy, the greatest sense of fulfilment that any soul can know in this world. 

Yes you are needed, you are needed in the world and you must be open to God’s guidance, to follow that Path unique and beautiful and powerful and seek to serve with humility and with a desire to put aside your fears, your willfulness, your preconceived notions and to adopt the Truths of Love, the guidance of God, the Path of Light, the knowing that comes from your souls that what you do is what is meant for you.

Beloved souls, the angels surround you. The angels surround you and God’s great care and protection and Love and presence is in your life, in your being. What more could one ask, my beloveds, then this special Gift, this special Gift that comes with His Love? Seek out the opportunities that God has laid before you, be open, be vigilant. Ask that your souls be ignited by Love, that the faculties of your souls may come alive, that you may truly know the meaning of my words and the understanding of your true selves and true purpose and true Gifts.

Walk with God and you will be guided ever forward with the Master Jesus leading the Way. Be at peace, my beloveds, and know that your coming together is of no accident but yet another Gift from your Heavenly Father. One of many that shall come in great abundance, in wave upon wave of loving directive, guided, powerful, purposeful gifts. And you shall focus on this and come to know this and be familiar with the ways of God and the ways of your soul. Beloveds, be at peace and know that God loves you beyond measure with such great abundance, to see this Love, to truly know this Love, to be lost in the feeling of being overwhelmed and swept away by this great, glorious Love. Be at peace. I love you, I am John and I love you.
