God bless you, my friends, it is good to be with you in this circle of Light, to pray with you and to see all of your beautiful faces coming together to receive in this way the blessing of God’s Love. 

It is best not to judge; to judge those with different attitudes (and) perspectives. For the world is full of diversity, of differences and every soul has its own unique path to walk and perspective, and each soul is unique and it is best to respect these differences and honor them and be loving. And those who have different ideas, who carry with them attitudes which you would define as “Natural Path” beliefs, I would say look to the soul. Do not consider too seriously what it is in the mind, for these things within the mind change in time. The soul grows and expands and evolves in a different way and a soul that is receptive to God’s Love, yet in their minds has a different definition what this is, is still a soul on the Divine Path nonetheless, and it is important to acknowledge this, to put away your biases. 

The world is full of misunderstandings, misconceptions, different attitudes and thoughts of the mind, so much that there is indeed much conflict in the world because many wish to have others think as they do, to believe as they do. You are well aware of all the religions in the world that are in conflict, because they wish for others to adopt their beliefs. No, my friends, it is important to be tolerant and loving, to look to the soul and acknowledge it is the soul yearning, the Light within the soul, the path of the soul that is what is important and lasting.

And those things of the mind will dissipate in time. Allow yourselves to embrace many from different cultures, religions, attitudes and understandings. Allow yourself to be a channel of Love in the world and to bring love forward wherever you are and whoever you meet. May there be a touch of love in your meeting, in your greeting, in your embrace and live by these higher standards and do not allow the biases of your minds to interfere with the flow of Love through your soul. This is what is important. This is God’s work. This is what you pray for, beloveds, to walk in this world as a channel of Love. And what restricts this? Only that which is within your minds, that which wishes to control the flow of Love, that which judges and feels a sense of withdrawing rather than opening. 

Now, I do not suggest that you become foolish in the ways you greet others, for some do not wish to connect with you and you must respect this and say a prayer for those who are aggressive and angry and who judge you. But you can love them from a distance, you can still be that channel of Love, you can still carry that Light shining all about you. And your soul discernment, that part of you that is in attunement with God will tell you how to open, when to open to another, even what you may say and do. This all comes through your soul awareness and God guiding you through your life. Give love always. Be a Light always. And walk this path with God in the flow of His Love and you cannot go wrong. You will only bring more harmony and Light to this world when you can let go of those parts of your mind which restrict your movements and flow and this Love.

Bless you all, beautiful souls, and some of you here have somewhat different perspectives than others yet you come to partake of the Love. It is your souls that bring you here. It is your desire, your longing to drink deep of these living waters that flood into the circle at this very moment. Drink deep. Allow this Love to permeate your being and change your minds, for it will do so and bring your souls to a place of deep and profound awakening. God has a plan for each soul in this world, you will come to know this as your eyes, the eyes of your soul slowly open and become aware of this world of Love, this true nature of life, and to yourselves deeply, and to know God as a tangible being and Source of Love and comfort, healing and joy. It all awaits. It comes to you now. It will come to you always if you are open and longing for these Gifts and blessings.

God bless you, my friends. Your friend Alec is always with you and I love you, beloved, beautiful and precious souls. I love you. God bless you.
