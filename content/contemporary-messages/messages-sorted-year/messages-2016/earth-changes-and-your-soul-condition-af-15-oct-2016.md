It is Seretta Kem. I see amongst you a great Light and a deep desire to serve God and the beginnings of new awakenings within you as the eyes of your souls begin to open and the awarenesses that come with the soul enlivened with God’s Divine Essence, His Love. And I tell you many deep and powerful insights will come to each one of you as you continue to be affected by the changes that are wrought by this Love, the power of this Love flowing into you. And the power of the force of change that is coming to this world, you witness at this very moment, as small aspect of the changes that are coming. 

There will be indeed many storms and shakings of the Earth, risings of the tide, as the Earth cleanses and readies itself for a new era of life upon your Earth and you will navigate these changes in harmony as you stay close to the Creator. Have your ears pricked to the guidance that will be given and be flexible, willing to change and adapt as all around you changes and all within you opens to the Divine blessings and Will. This is the time in which you need to be strong, to search your souls and take within that the wisdom that comes and be in harmony with God. For it is the disharmony which mankind has brought within themselves and within this world that has sparked these changes and responses. 

The world seeks balance, life seeks life, and harmony with the rhythms of God’s Will and creation. And you cannot, my beloveds, ignore the laws of creation, you cannot be immune to the world that responds to your indifference and your wilful desire to ignore the balance that God has created within the world. 

Yes, my beloveds, you step upon the verge of much change and there will be struggles and difficulties but you will be protected and carried through this time and you cannot carry fear but hope, hope for a world that is in harmony and there will be joy and love and much to be gained from what is to come. Great joy to you, my beloveds, Love and Light. Know that you are loved, that you are in the Light, that we will be with you as you continue to navigate this world in flux and change.

God bless you, beloveds. Seretta Kem loves you dearly, is with you as you continue to grow and seek truth and allow the Light of God to build within you. Beloved souls,
