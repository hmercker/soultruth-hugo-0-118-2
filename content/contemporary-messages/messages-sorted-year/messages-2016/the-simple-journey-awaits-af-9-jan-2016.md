Thank you for the appreciation of my picture. I must say I look a little different now in the world of spirit. I think you would approve of my appearance, for the Love within my soul has changed me a great deal, and the joy that I feel with this Gift of the Father’s Love radiates through every part of my being.

You have had a good day together, have you not? You have come together in Love embracing one another, declaring your support and commitment to doing God’s work of Love in this world, and embracing the possibilities of new channels of Love, and new ways of loving. Of being in this world in a way that is more in harmony with your soul’s desires and God’s Will, and we are so pleased to see your acknowledgement of this new opening within you. Each one of you has shifted dramatically in your thinking and being, my beloveds, although you do not see it as a dramatic shift within you, it truly is. If you think back, a year back, do you not see a big difference within you? How God’s Love has brought you to a place of surrender, of letting go of those wilful parts of yourselves, those parts within your mind that seek dominance and gratification and allowing the gentler part of you, your soul to emerge within your consciousness. And although this part of you is indeed gentle, loving, bright and beautiful, there is a power to it, a great power to influence, to change the conditions of this world and all that is around you. For it is the power of God’s Love, the great change agent of the universe, this wondrous Love, with its power to heal, to bring harmony, to bring peace, and to bring great and deep insights into God’s creation that brings this about. This allows you, my beloveds, to gaze upon your brothers and sisters in compassion with a knowing that we all journey forth towards Light and it is your gift, your blessing to help another in some small way upon that journey, to lead in Light, to lead in Love, to lead in wisdom and to lead in humility. 

Yes, there is no need for impressive structures, organizations swelling with membership and grand ideas. No, my beloveds, it is only a commitment and a reaching to God, and in that acknowledging amongst yourselves that you all reach together for God’s Loving Touch, his healing imbuing within your soul this eternal Love, and you all acknowledge this, my beloveds. You are not upon your high horses. No, you walk upon the ground in humility in a willingness to release all those conditions within you, so human, so anxious and fearful, even though now you are not so clear as to your future, your path. Yet, your souls have great clarity and surety and faith that God will lead you along this road as it is meant to be, and with this humble, faithful, listening and devotion you will be lead with each day, each breath, each prayer will lead you along this life. And, without these mindful expectations you will be able to truly listen to God’s Will and you will not step in the way of this flow of Love, but will accept and joyfully walk with this flow knowing that it is the right way. This is a more powerful and beautiful and perfect way, for God knows where we all must go, what we all must do and His Wisdom will carry us there, showing us  the Light of His Love and the perfect Wisdom of his Great Soul.

And so my beloveds, you have walked a little further this day towards the Light, you have released something that would impede you and embrace Love which will guide you ever closer, ever further along this Path. Yes, there is much work to do, my beloveds, and you begin to acknowledge how this work will unfold and how you in your humility and your love for God will follow in faith, in love and a new confidence will emerge within you, unshakable. And, you will not be assailed by your own doubts, you will not be assailed by the conditions of others. You will be secure in God’s Loving Grace and Touch and Embrace, and in this you will know deep peace and wondrous joy. And, in this the universe will begin to open within your consciousness, my beloveds, a wondrous opening, a profound knowledge and understanding of God’s great creation and your place within it, beloveds. 

Yes, each of you has a deep purpose, a road to walk, a great journey of discovery and service and  love. Continue upon that Path knowing that today you have walked a little further, you have embraced more Truth, you have acknowledged your souls a little more today. Do not step backwards, my beloveds, but continue upon your journey ever forward towards the Light, and we who are with you, who support you upon this journey, who love you so dearly will always be by your side walking with you because we love you. We honor your journey and God honors all of our journeys in His loving, beautiful acknowledgement in this great Light. 

Beloveds, you do not walk alone, you never will and God will always have His Hand upon your souls because you have made that choice for Love. You have acknowledged the desires of your soul, you have accepted the simple Truth of the redemption of your soul through Love, and you cannot turn back and you will walk forward in a great enduring pace, quickening, resolute, joyful. 

God bless you, my beloveds. Your friend Faith is with you and I will look forward to that day when I may stand at the door of that place far away and greet you as you walk through that threshold knowing that you are meant to be within that house of God. Beloved souls, it is coming and all of you shall be there at one time or another bringing Light, bringing your beautiful Light to that place so in need of Light. God bless you, beloveds. Faith loves you. God bless you.
