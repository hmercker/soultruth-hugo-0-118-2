I am Andrew. Each of you is loved, each of you is loved by God and each of you is loved by many, but for many of you it is difficult to feel that love, to acknowledge that love within yourselves, to walk in the Light that is that true awareness, that feeling of being loved and cherished and beautiful in the world. Beloved souls, it is time to open your eyes to Love, to acknowledge the power of Love with your lives, to truly go to God to receive that great inflowing of His Love, that is always there awaiting your prayer and desire to receive it. 

All that inhibits this blessing from flowing into yourselves in great abundance is that doubt within you, that you are loved. Beloved souls, feel Love deeply, know Love profoundly, accept love with humility. Be prayerful and turn to God with a desire to truly know that flame of Love that is burning within your souls, to accept this, to express this, to allow it to infuse all parts of your being. 

Beloved children, you are loved. The power of this Love is influencing you and may influence you in a deeper way, a more conscious way if you but accept its existence, its Light that is burring within your souls. 

So much of the world distracts you and brings a message to you that you are unworthy, that humanity is not a beautiful creation of God and this is not true. Each and every soul in this world is a beautiful creation of God and as each soul comes to recognize this great truth and comes to God in acknowledging His Love for you, you will be changed. Each will be changed in this great touch, this wondrous benediction, this energetic flow of Love from God’s Great Soul into your soul. it is so simple, my beloveds, so very simple and yet when you turn within yourselves, do you truly accept this? Do you truly rejoice in this acknowledgement and understanding of your own glorious selves, ignited, awakened, and nourished by these living waters, the flow of God’s Love that will carry you along towards a life fulfilled, a life full and rich and meaningful? 

Love is the key, my beloveds, it is the message we bring to you over and over again to know God in this way. To know yourselves in this way is what will open these awarenesses and bring the flood of joy, the joyful acknowledgement of your own unique and beautiful creation and a joyful acknowledgement that you are part of an enormous family of brothers and sisters in this world. How can you judge your brothers and sisters if you feel the joy and acknowledgement of how much you are all loved, how much you are loved? 

Allow the barriers of your mind to fall. The fears that come from your hurts to dissipate and the strength of knowing that quiet, beautiful, powerful Love within you come forth so that it shines through your eyes, that is felt with your embrace, that is part of your every day and every moment in life. That all you meet, and all you encounter including your own self is touched and feels the joy of Love, the power of Love, that healing comfort that comes with Love, that peace that passes all understanding as God pours His Love through you to another. 

It is Love, my beloveds, that will save the world and bring peace. Without it, all is lost and with it all is gained as you continue to discover, to accept and express this wondrous love that burns within your souls. Yes, as you change so the world changes. As you are touched so a Light increases in this world because it increases within you. 

Continue to pray for this blessing of Love. Continue to be open to desire it intensely, to put your intentions and prayers to your Heavenly Father so that in his beautiful way you will be blessed with the essence of God, the Divine Love.

Thank you, beloved souls. God bless you upon your journey. We are with you, we shall never leave you and God is always present. It is for you to know this and accept that you are truly loved. God bless you, I am Andrew and I love you. God bless you.
