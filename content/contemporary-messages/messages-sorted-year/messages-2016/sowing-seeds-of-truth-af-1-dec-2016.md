My friends, may the Father’s Love find a deep and continuous inflowing into your soul. I am Tahlia and I am a part of your circle and I have a very special bond with my friend who comes from where I came from and I greet her in love and I wish to encourage her in her efforts to explore the many gifts that reside within her and are powerful and just beginning to emerge. The gift of healing my friends is a powerful gift and I come to assist her and all of you who wish to give healing to others, for I too, possess the gift of healing and I knew of this gift when I was on earth and now this gift has evolved and strengthened and flourished as I have progressed through the spheres of spirit into the Celestial Kingdom. 

Yes, the Father’s Love has indeed transformed my soul and my gifts and so it will be for each one of you if you desire the gift of His Love to bring the openings and awakenings of your true selves. Each of you struggles to know yourself, each of you have had many different experiences in this world which have shaped your views and thinking and the condition of your soul. When you come to God in sincerity and that deep longing of desire to make contact, to be open to what God has to give you, you change the condition within your life and soul, beloved friends. You set yourself on a course that is often very different from what you began with in your life. 

If there is something within your soul that guides you, influences and convinces you that this is the road you must take, how you must be in the world with God and you may often be perplexed as to why others do not follow or also see the benefits of this particular road. of God’s Love. You must take into account their life condition, their perspective, their experiences and though many of you have been fortunate to have made this choice early in your life many will not but they will come to this truth in time. How is this to be so? It is because you and others like you are sowing the seeds of this truth wherever you go and some will take root and others will not. But you are a vital part of this process; bringing truth and understanding to the world. And as these seeds take lodgement within the soul, remember this my brethren, you may not receive the reaction or the appreciation in the moment from those who you speak to and give to these truths but a seed is planted, something has changed, a shift, an opening. In time, often when that particular soul progresses into spirit, they are reminded of this truth because that truth has made a lodging within their souls. There are many ways to do God’s work, to bring truth. You acknowledge the dear daughter who brings truth by giving love and comfort and strength to many, she brings truth. And for our dear son, who puts truth upon the wires, open to all to see and each of you bring truth in your own life, in many different ways. Like the petals upon a beautiful flower, each one unique, each one joined to the other, and you all must be a single voice with the resounding truth of God’s Love as your clarion call in the world. 

Do so my beloved, beautiful friends, do so in those beautiful, unique ways that you have in the world. Each one complementing the other, each one supporting the other, each one going to God for the truth and nourishment of His Love. 

But as you all evolve, as you all grow in strength, as you all discover your gift, as your eyes open you will continue to be ever stronger channels of truth and love, comfort and healing to many, many souls. This is what you have chosen, this is what you will continue to choose, for God has you firmly in His grasp and he will guide you along that road that is uniquely yours. The road of service, the road where each opportunity is seen and grasped by your highest of intentions to serve God. 

Continue, beloved souls, you are strong, you are beautiful, you are humble and you give so much light to the world. Continue to sow these seeds of truth, to bring the comfort and the love. Cherish every soul you meet, cherish yourselves and continue to be in this mighty flow of Love that will carry you forth, destinations unknown but indeed destinations rich with the possibilities brought to you.

And I am with you, beloved souls, and I will continue to be a part of your work as you continue to be a part of the work of the Master in this world. So many, so many spirits, Celestial Angels that you are not aware of are a part of this great work and plan for the salvation of mankind. 

Always be open to God’s guidance, allow the flow of His Will to carry you within the river of His Love and all will be well. Many surprises await, are you not surprised that you are all together this day, in this place, for this is minor compared to what is to come. So much more awaits.

God bless you, Tahlia loves you.    
