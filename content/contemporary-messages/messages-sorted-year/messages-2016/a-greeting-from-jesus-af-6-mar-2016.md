# A Greeting from Jesus



March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2016

Selah, Washington, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike.


It is Jesus, I love you. You begin to embark upon your spiritual journeys in a deeper way, my beloveds, and you will release those material burdens that will inhibit this, each in your own way, in your own time, and you will dedicate yourselves to God more fully and walk upon that path of service in ways that you do not anticipate at this time. But you feel the momentum of this, you feel the need and desire to unburden yourselves, to be free in the Light, to have the capacity and the flexibility to walk wherever God will guide you, my beloveds, you will be in this world but not of this world, a great and mighty channel of Love to bring change as the world itself unburdens and becomes more pure and healed in the Light of Godâ€™s Touch. 

You will be the vanguards for this in many ways and join others who will join others in bringing a great and profound change to this world as God Touches each soul that shows the way to greater peace and harmony in this world amongst all his children, amongst all that is on this world. The power of change brings Light, my beloveds, and the deep Touch from God will bring reverberating change wave upon wave and you must be strong, my beloveds, and able to be free from your attachments and in the Love of God in a full and fruitful way. 

Beloveds, walk your path confidently yourselves and be close to God. All will be well. Mighty blessings shall be yours and great joy. God bless you, I am Jesus and I come to love you and to remind you that you are under my cloak, that you are loved by me and all is blessed by God. God bless you.
