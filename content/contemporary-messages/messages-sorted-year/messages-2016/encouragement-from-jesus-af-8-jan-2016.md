Bless these thy children who have within them a great purpose to fulfil in this life. Put your Hand upon them, dear Father, that with every breath they may feel Your presence and may the angels whisper into their ears and Your Love flow upon them, within them and around them so that they may have their life within this movement in the flow of your Divine Essence. And open their hearts, beloved Father, that they may feel Love and compassion for all they meet, that there be no barriers to this flow of Love to their world, for as they walk in this world they walk in Light, and You, my beloved Father, touch many souls through them, touch many souls and we are grateful for Your touch. We seek Your touch at this moment to bring us ever closer to the Fountainhead of Your Love, to bring us closer to the understanding of Your Truths and Your creation, to bring us ever deeper into the Light of Your presence, for we are Your children, Father, and You nurture us with every breath. You carry us forward in Your loving arms, helping us to be in harmony with You and Your Love, opening within us the true soul awareness that will bring the mighty changes in our consciousness that we may bring change in our world walking as Your instruments of peace and Love and change.

My beloveds, you will experience many changes in the times to come, both within you and within your lives. There is much awaiting you and your souls feel the joy of the anticipation of this, your souls know what is to come, and God has placed within you a great desire to be agents of change in this world, to usher in greater peace and Light, Love and understanding for your brothers and sisters. Yes, my daughters, you will all teach in the times to come and this son will indeed teach many. God will open the doors, my beloveds, He will open the doors. You will be astonished at what doors may be opened, opportunities may lay before you as you commit yourselves to that great plan of our Heavenly Father’s for the salvation of mankind.

Be joyous, my beloved brethren. Be joyous for you are swept upon a current, a flow, a river that shall take you to many wondrous places, shall provide for you the great nourishment of your souls and shall bring you revelation upon revelation and shall open within you a great channel of service for mankind. You are the vanguards, my beloveds, you are the vanguards bringing these revelations, the manifestations of God’s Love and healing and presence to the lost and blind, those in darkness and ignorance, those who suffer so. You will bring the Light that is required to open their eyes, bring comfort to their bodies and their minds, bring Truth to their souls. The hand of God is upon you and I am with you, I am Jesus. I am with you, my beloveds.

Carry this Light within you into the world, to many dark places, to many who await you and who long for what you have. This comes. It unfolds in the perfect timing of God’s Will. I am with you, I will never leave you and I bless you all upon your journeys, your journey to God, your journey as God’s instruments upon this world, and the journey of revelation of true understanding of the soul. You are blessed and I love you so, I love you so. My disciples, you are my disciples. Beloveds, be at peace. Know that you are loved beyond measure and soon all that you are and all that you do will reflect this Love and all its purity and grace and beauty. God bless you, God bless you.
