# The Gifts of the Soul.

I am Keea and I have come to speak on the subject of the gifts of the soul. Every being has gifts and abilities and inclinations. And many of these gifts and abilities within the natural being, the mortal, are brought forth through education and a desire to develop creative gifts, mental acuities, understandings and, of course, their hearts bring gifts of love, compassion and empathy. And many things arise from the soul and these natural inclinations and expressions. But when a soul is imbued with God’s Love something happens that transforms these gifts in a certain way and there arises many other gifts which manifest through the soul.

If you think of light passing through a prism and how that light is refracted into many different colors, the Light within your soul brings this effect to some degree that the many aspects of your being, your Light become refracted and changed by the prism of God’s Love, and each beautiful color exemplifies a gift. And you have many gifts and all souls have within them many gifts. And these color combinations, these combinations of gifts are different and unique for each soul. And, of course, you have personality, individuality and your experiences determine much of what you express in this mortal world. And some are more able to see spiritually, to perceive spirit, to hear, to have a strong connection of the mind and able to communicate with spirit. Now each individual has to some degree these capacities but some are more accentuated than others, stronger because of the very make-up of the soul and to some degree the filtering of the mind. Some have a gift for healing and this starts with an innate gift within the soul but also becomes manifest through the physicality of the body, the purity of the spirit, and the attitudes of the mind. And this gift of healing, which indeed each soul is capable of, will manifest in different ways because of these aspects and elements that are inherent within each soul. And there are many other gifts. Some are deeply compassionate and empathetic. Some have the capacity to perceive the vastness of the universe and the laws of God’s Creation, the intricacies of His Creation and this is not a mere mental capacity but is a function of the mind of the soul as well.

And then there comes the wisdom of the soul. Each soul has this capacity to know God, to understand His Laws, His communications to you. And as I have said these bits of information are often filtered by the mind and in many, many cases are completely blocked by the mind. It is your challenge to access this wisdom which lay within each one of you because you are blessed with God’s Love, that Light brings the wisdom, it shines wisdom through your soul, your soul has the capacity to absorb, to reflect, to express the kind of Divine Wisdom that comes with God’s Love. 

God will use every gift that is within you that you allow to be expressed, which you pray to be opened. God will use what you are able to realize, express and make more full within yourself through His Love, through your prayers, through your efforts in service.

Yes, you will come to know what lies within. You will come to know your true selves and the great beauty that God has created. And each of you, shining your beautiful, unique lights, colors, fabric that is your soul. And all of humanity is meant to express these beautiful spiritual gifts, to see the world through different eyes, to express themselves through these beautiful, colorful gifts and ways. This is meant for each soul. And you, my beloveds, will be an example of this. God will ignite within you wondrous abilities which are inherent and often not expressed in this world but shall be so powerfully and beautifully. For the world needs to shift in its thinking and doing and in being more in harmony with God’s Love, more in harmony with their true selves and their true gifts. And the more beautiful souls who are willing to live in this way, the more change and Light will come to this world.

You are beautiful gems each one and the Light will shine and sparkle through you and this will cause a touch with each soul that you encounter. You will perceive and know and embrace and love each soul and recognize the beauty that lies within each soul. Continue on your path with a brighter expectation of what is to emerge within you and come into your lives, for there is much that will come and a great deal for you to discover within. This is a wondrous journey is it not? A beautiful, unfolding within yourselves, that you may see the glory of God’s Creation in all its beauty and intricacies and wonderment. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Kea and I love you and I am with you more often than you might know, helping you. And I especially help you all in your sleep states to learn and to grow, to connect, to be together, to pray together and you are together often even though you reside in different places, you come together often. It is that strong bond of love that draws you and brings you the support that you add to one another, another of God’s gifts. God bless you and I love you.
