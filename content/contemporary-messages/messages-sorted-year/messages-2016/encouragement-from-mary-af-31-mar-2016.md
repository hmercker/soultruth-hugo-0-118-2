My dear, precious, beloved daughters, God bless you. I am Mary. May the Father’s Love find a constant inflowing into your souls, my beloved, beautiful, precious souls, eager for the Love, eager to serve God, eager for all that God has to give to you. And God’s hand rests firmly upon you, my beloveds, and He guides you with His sweet whispers, His heavenly Breath as you listen to your souls, as you try to discern what it is that God wishes for you to do. God does not push or insist upon your service but asks in His gentle whispers, asks in His loving flow, and it is all in harmony and in love. It all unfolds in His Grace and Will. When you do God’s Will you too are nurtured in that flow, you too feel the joy of it, the rightness of it, you too are carried in the river of Love. And God may ask you to do difficult things at times, taxing things, complex things, but you are given what you require to do so. And in many respects this service in which you stretch and struggle with allows you to learn and grow in your souls. This is your blessing and benefit, to strengthen your love and your perceptions and your abilities.

This is a difficult world, filled with many complex and inharmonious elements, and the motivations of those you encounter, the needs and the deep deprivation within, tries your efforts, I know, my children. It tries your efforts to cut through the darkness, to bring the simple Love into the picture, to encourage those around you to drink of these living waters, to be open to God’s healing Touch and to understand these simple Truths. And you persist, my beloveds, you continue to grow, to accept what God gives you in Love and to feel the rightness of your steps. You must be bold at times, clear and strong when you are confronted by those who would pull you down. Be compassionate and humble, yet firm. Do not shrink from the onslaught, but stand in the Light with steady gaze and firm resolve, that I will stand here in the service of God, I will stand here because I know the power of Love. I understand that Love will heal and make harmonious this world, that for too long mankind has relied upon their meager powers and perceptions to discern truth and rightness and bring harmony. So many do not understand that love must come first, love must come above all else. For with this expression, this channel of Love from God, this Touch from the Heavenly Source, all negativity and error must fall away and truth and harmony and peace must rise up in its place. 

Yes, it takes strength. It takes faith. It takes a willingness to allow God to guide you, to trust in this and to have great faith in God’s wisdom. And many times your minds interfere and cause doubt and react expressing this human condition which you carry as well in yourselves. Have compassion for yourselves, my beloveds, when this happens, and choose the rightness, the harmony, the truth that lay within your souls. Yes, it is a choice, it is a choice and every moment is rife with these challenges and these choices – how you think, what you do, where you go, who you embrace, when you pray, how you pray, what you read and what you express. So many things are wrapped up in this choice for love. And God is ever willing to assist you in whatever you do to uplift you, to guide you and His greatest desire is that your souls be redeemed by His Love and you are walking upon this Path of redemption. You are seeking this Light. You are reaching for this higher place, both within yourselves and within your lives. And you do have a deep desire to serve God, each one of you, and God will provide the opportunities to serve Him as He whispers His Will within you, giving you the guidance you require, showing you the steps that you must take, helping you to grow within your souls, to heighten your perceptions, to listen to the wisdom that lay within your soul.

Yes, this Path is not an easy path but it is a rewarding one, filled with many opportunities to grow, to learn, to serve and to love. And you will continue to embrace what God gives you with each day, that gift of life, that gift of choice, that gift of service - a gift, a prayer and openness to your soul. You all walk in Light, you shall continue to grow upon your individual paths and to seek out the Father’s Will. It unfolds like a beautiful flower in the warmth of the sun, each petal a new gift, a wondrous opportunity, a powerful lesson, a great opportunity to serve and to love. And this beautiful flower has many, many petals for you to examine. 

Beloved souls, I am with you in your struggles, I am with you in your conversations, in your service, in all the ways that you love in this world. I am with you and I shall continue to walk with you. My precious daughters, blessed are your beautiful souls in the Light of God’s Love. Blessed are you who resolutely walk the Path of Love. God bless you. God bless you and I love you. I am Mary and I love you.
