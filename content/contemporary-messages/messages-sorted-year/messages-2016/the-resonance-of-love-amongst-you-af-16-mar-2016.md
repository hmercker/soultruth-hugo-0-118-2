My brothers and sisters, I come. I am Jesus. I come to be with you in your prayers, in your efforts to reach God and in your efforts to love one another and work together. It matters not the task, my beloveds, but the love that goes into that task, your willingness to work together, to be in harmony with one another, to walk this Earth in harmony and love brings Light, and brings the Touch of God into your lives. Your willingness to accept and embrace each other is profound in its impact, for each of you have your challenges and your gifts, your personalities, and your uniqueness. It is a great challenge at times to accept and embrace another who, in your perception, is so different from yourself. But I tell you, each sister, each brother is a child of God and in your small circle you each long for God, you long for His embrace, for His Love to flow into your souls and this desire that you share amongst you, my brethren, makes for a powerful bond which shall last for all eternity, my beloveds.

And so it will go in your lives, meeting many souls who on the surface appear so different, possibly a different culture and language, with a different perspective of the world, and these are of the mind, yet the soul, the soul resonates with love. This is what you must focus on, my beloveds, the resonance of love amongst you, the Touch of God’s mighty Grace that influences each and everyone here, and many more in your wider circle and many more you have not met but will meet in time. It is that resonance of love which will draw you all together and create a new world, a world where love reigns supreme. 

And you must accept all those you meet with love, no matter how different they may seem to you, how foreign is their thinking, and their appearance, and their demeanour. Think of the soul, think of the soul that resides in each of these precious children of God and greet that soul with love and recognition and put aside your thoughts of judgments, of reticence, of fear but greet the soul with love. And in this way a channel of Love opens, and the touch, the connection, the bond is accomplished. And that bond creates a Light that connects you with that soul in the world. And as these connections of Light spread and multiply, God will weave a wondrous tapestry of Light surrounding this world in Light, bonding each soul to another, to another, multiplying and multiplying, changing the world in this way, soul to soul, which will influence the thinking of man, the ways of mankind. 

There will be indeed a deep change in this world, as souls are awakened and a greater understanding is gleaned, through the awakening, the bondings of souls one to another, and the bondings of each soul to God. And indeed this is the new birth, the new birth of mankind, and you, my beloveds, are a part of this. Each of you carries this great Truth. You are a testimony to this Truth and you carry a great responsibility to shine your Lights in the world, to bring this simple truth of God’s breath to all you meet. It is your courage, your tenacity, your strength, your faith, your sure knowledge of God’s Love that you bring wherever you go. God provides for you all that you require to do so. He opens doors, many, many doors. He provides the means for you to travel to connect with one another and to connect with many others. He gives all that you require, my beloveds. And as your faith strengthens, as the Love grows within your souls, as that great revolution empowers and overpowers your mind you will expand your work which is God’s work in the world.

It must be so. You will feel so compelled to do so. There will be no resistance, no fear, no concern for self, merely a passion, a passion so hot, so clear to be God’s purveyor of Love, and in so doing this becoming the instrument of change in the world. It will be your undying desire, and this shall continue for all eternity, my beloveds, to bring greater love, to manifest God’s Love in greater capacities, to utilize your gifts, your potentials. Every thought, every deed will be a part of this work, this flow, this great, great effort which is God’s Plan for the salvation of mankind. 

And you feel this, each one of you, my beloveds, you feel this desire building within you, this great concern, how will we accomplish this work in a world so mute and unwilling to listen? And I tell you as you listen to God’s Guidance, as you are influenced by the angels, as you allow me to lead you upon these paths of servitude and love, great works will be accomplished, surprising in their effects, wondrous in their results. 

You stand upon a threshold. Each of you are feeling the sense of confrontation towards whatever it is that holds you back from this. And you are releasing day by day those conditions which keep you from these holy tasks to serve God. And each day you will inch forward to that place of freedom, of joyous acknowledgement, and of letting go that loving flow of God’s great river. 

And some of you are feeling the sense of frustration. You are all feeling an eagerness and desire to move forward. I tell you, you are shedding those conditions which hold you back. It is happening in its own way for each of you and this shall continue for a while. This is preparation for what is to come and we need for you, my beloveds, to be strong and clear, unfettered by error and the human condition, to be strong and powerful Lights in the world. aAnd when you are in that place the fantasies of your minds projecting how you will do God’s Work will be replaced by a sure knowledge of your souls, how you will proceed with each day. Each day will build upon the other and the other as you walk within God’s Plan and serve within His Will and know as you can only know through the knowledge of your souls. The true knowledge comes from that deep place within you that is connected to your Heavenly Father. 

So much awaits, my brethren, and I come to reassure you that none of you are lost upon a circuitous road but each walks his road, guided by God and you shall accomplish what your heart desires. It shall come in many different ways, ways unanticipated, ways blessed fully by the Hand of God. Continue, my beloveds, to pray for His Love. Continue to seek your guidance. Continue to shed those old ways and be redeemed by God’s Love fully, completely, joyously and wondrously. I am with you with all of your struggles and all of your keen desires, your dedications, your efforts, your loving commitment. I am with you, beloveds, and I shall always be with you for you are my brothers, you are my sisters in this wondrous Path of Love. We shall walk this Path together always and know the joy of at-onement with our Creator. 

Beloved souls, walk with this sure knowledge, walk with this sure knowledge that you are loved, cared for, protected, guided. The way is open to you, the way is open and clear and lit. We shall not falter but move forward, move ever forward in loving grace. God bless you, my beloved, beautiful, beautiful, brothers and sisters. God bless you. I am Jesus and I truly love you.
