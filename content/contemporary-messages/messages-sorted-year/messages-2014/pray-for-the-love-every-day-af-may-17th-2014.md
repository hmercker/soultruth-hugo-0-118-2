# Pray for the Love every day.

This is Jesus, yes I am Jesus of the Bible, and Master of the Celestial Heavens.1 I am joyed that you have come together to pray for God’s Love, to be together in peace and harmony, to share yourselves with one another in loving ways, and to trust that together you will find your way to God, with some of the answers that you seek will come to you.

And I bless you, I bless you in your yearnings, and your desire for Truth and your willingness to open yourselves in this way, and I want you to know that every soul who seeks this Love, will be loved, will be cared for by God, will be claimed by God as His children and you will be protected and guided and loved, and cared for, enveloped in this holy touch, this loving, loving embrace.

Follow me my children, follow me into greener pastures where God will restore your souls and bring you to a place of deep and abiding peace that you may come to know who you really are, and you may come to recognise God in all His Glory and Light and Love and care for you. It is yours for the asking my children. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and the door shall be opened unto you my children. It shall be opened to you to put aside your earthly cares, to be as a child in prayer and longing, to acknowledge that deep need within to be with God, to know God, to be nurtured by God’s Love.

 

**1** This particular phrase is very significant, and not often used by Jesus. The significance is that it ANNOUNCES to all in the heavens, that he is who he claims to be, and is not an imposter. It is a good test of any spirit who claims to be Jesus, to ask them to make this statement. It was doubtless used here to ensure that the claim is not made, that this is not Jesus.
