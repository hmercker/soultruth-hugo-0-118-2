# Walk in the Light.

Dear beloved souls, you walk in light this day, and you pray in the presence of our beloved Father who loves you so and embraces you with His Love. Breathe this Love in, may it rest in that deep place within you and allow His Touch to transform you and make you His precious child, for you are His beloved creation, worthy of all the blessings, all the love, all the healing, all the peace that you may allow yourselves to receive.

Do not let any thing within you doubt this, or obstruct this - to just be in the arms of the Creator and receive His Gift, His Care. This is all that is required of you my children, to be in the arms of the Creator. In this trust in your love for Him, in your acceptance of His love for you will come the mighty changes, the great knowledge, the gifts that lie within will open and flourish and you will walk in harmony and peace. And you will become that beautiful channel of love which God wishes you to be and your soul desires to be.

Love yourselves my children, love yourselves. Acknowledge the beauty that is you and your creation, your being. And in this loving you will love others and in this loving you will bring others to light, to love, to truth, to understand how beautiful they are. For God will touch them through you and so it will go one soul to one soul to one soul - the flame of truth passed into the world, you are all messengers of Truth.

And in your acceptance of this love comes the message and from your example comes the message, and in your love comes the message. Be the Love, know the Love and know your Heavenly Father. This is the simple way, this is the way that your heavenly Father beckons you to be and to live and to accept. Within your souls we know that you cannot be anything but God’s Child, His beloved. Accept this, allow this, and be this, and all will unfold as it should be in harmony, in Truth, in peaceful loving and living of the truth.

Ask each day my children, what may I do to serve you dear Father this day? What may I do to help my brothers and sisters this day? The tasks and the opportunities, the possibilities will unfold before your eyes as souls are drawn to you, drawn to your light, drawn because their souls hunger, drawn because their souls recognise the light.

This is simple, this is beautiful and this is your purpose my children in this world, to share the light, to pass the flag and to be with God in your loving acceptance of God’s touch within you, and about you. And in this, the angels will support you and be with you every moment as God’s gift to you to help you upon the path of your life. Walk with us my children and this glorious effort for the salvation of mankind, this is God’s plan. He has asked you to be a part of this glorious work, to help humanity and in this requires humility and trust and a great strength to follow the guidance, the Will of God to walk in love always.

Put aside your differences, your fears your prejudices, your judgments and be in the Love, and all will be well and much work lies ahead for every soul willing and accepting of the Will of God, the Love of God and accepting that God loves them as he does each one - every soul.

God Bless you. I am John the Beloved and I love you. God Bless you and may his great love carry you to great heights, the highest route, the greatest service and most joyous unfolding of your love. God Bless you and I love you.
