# Jesus wants you for a sunbeam.

Jesus wants you for a sunbeam! And so do I. (Goldie) And Jesus says he wants you for a sunbeam, especially you Geoff. (Laughs) Smile! Aah my friends, do you know how blessed you are to be in this light, to come together as you are, in loving harmony, in joyous prayer to our heavenly Father who does loves us so much and gives to us so much to every soul here. Be joyous at your blessings my dear dear friends, be joyous in your blessings, and how you are loved, and how much love you have to give to the world. This is so important - to be in the world in joy and love. And when you need cheering, ask for me to come, and I will cheer you, I will be with you, and you will feel the laughter and the pixie dust. (Laughs) I will sprinkle it all over, and you will feel the joy. Life is joy, life is fun, life is beautiful, and it is for you to have that joyous play in your life, and wonderful friendship together to dance and sing, and acknowledge the beauty that is within each soul. Acknowledgement and joy and laughter. Bless you my dear friends, I love you, and I love when you sing, bless you.
