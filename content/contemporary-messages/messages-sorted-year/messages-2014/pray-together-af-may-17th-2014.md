# Pray together.

May 17th, 2014

Caloundra, Australia.

Received by Al Fike.

 

...and to acknowledge the love within. And this love has flowed into your souls, my children. You have received this gift this day and you shall continue to do so, if you pray together. We will be with you, we in spirit will be with you to assist you. Each one has been assigned an angel to pray with them and to be with them as you participate in this journey together. Blessings will be given my children, as you are willing to receive and open and prayerful. God Bless you, I am Andrew and I love you.
