John the Beloved received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, beloved souls, I am John the Beloved. I come today to pray with you all as you continue to reach for God, reach for the highest, and open yourselves to His great blessings of Love. The dear child had a vision of what is to come. I say that what he saw was truly something of the soul, knowing that God has a plan. Indeed, all of you may have such visions, understanding, provided you are willing to open yourselves to the gifts and soulful awareness that God has given you. God does not restrict His loving Touch upon any of you. He wishes for you all to be at peace, to know that you are well taken care of, ministered to, in the Light of His Love as He rests His Hand upon you.

Be at peace, beloved souls. Nothing can bring you from God, and only you can deliver yourself to God. May you exercise the desire of your soul to be in alignment with God, to truly know His Love for you, to truly be in the flow of His Will, not only for you but for this world. In this way you will find deep peace and great joy. Joy and peace that few in your world have ever known, and yet God lays all before you in loving generosity and abundance. For, each soul upon your world may receive such a blessing, the manifestation of their many gifts, but it is for you to ask, to step forward and open yourself to the Divine. This is the law that cannot be any other way. It is the desire of your soul, manifest in your lives, awakened by desire and effort to truly be in alignment with all that is of God's Creation, the laws of God’s Love.

We stand beside you, beloved souls. We pray with you. We are God’s harbinger of truth and shall always be so, and we beckon you forward in light. Do not allow the trials and tribulations of this world hold you from the light. Do not allow the fears of this world and the uncertainty of this world, to hold you in darkness. Be free in the truth and light of God's Embrace. Know this peace, know the joy of His Love.

In this way you will find all that troubles you, all that troubles the world, will melt away in light, and you will know a joy everlasting, a peace and serenity so deep and clear that nothing will touch you, that will disturb it or take you from it. It is that place where you and God are intertwined in light, that all that is promised may be fulfilled. All that is meant for each child upon this world, each child of God's Creation, will be awakened and given without end, eternal light, beloveds, eternal joy, eternal progress in the awakening and expansion of your soul. These things God promises you, and it is for you to open that door where all is fulfilled, all is given in love. Seek the Kingdom of Heaven within you, beloved souls, that kingdom that is awakened by God's gift of Love, and all else will follow, all else will unfold in harmony and peace and joy.

God bless you, beloveds. I am John, and my love for you great, beloved souls. Beloved souls, be at peace and know that God is with us all upon a magnificent journey. So we shall walk together, sing the praises of God together, and truly be in the Light and harmony of His Presence, this moment, beloveds, this moment. God bless you. God bless you.
