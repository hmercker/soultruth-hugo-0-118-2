It is I Care. Those of us in spirit who have progressed into the Celestial realms have left behind any regrets though that does not mean that when we crossed over, we didn’t have some. For every soul to a greater or lesser extent when coming into spirit has those things they wished they had done (or not done). Generally, this is some good thing, helping others or making a courageous move, discovering something good for humanity, and last, but not least, serving others. For as you know service brings great joy and those who take a leap of faith and find themselves in harmony with the love of God and His laws are endlessly thanking God and all the Angels for inspiring them to do so. So, I wish for you all to have very few regrets and to fulfill your lives with those things that you have always wished to do to whatever degree that is possible.  
   
I know that your deeper wish is to serve the world and whenever you do so your soul feels the reward and in the spirit world it will be magnified greatly. The more you live in Grace, in harmony the easier it is to walk in freedom without fear and bring your love, your kindness, your compassion, your gifts, to the world. 
 
If you could see all of us here in this great circle of love, you would be astounded. And as you grow and as your souls continue to receive the love of God and your spiritual eyes are opened you will begin to see and feel our presence. 
 
May God continue to bless each one and bring you your heart’s desire and every good gift, every perfect gift in His love. May it be yours! I love you. God bless you!
