# Soar to Your Heavenly Father

October 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Pacific Coast Soul Awakening Tour, Menifee, CA, USA

Confucius received by Al Fike

[Birds of a feather do flock together.] Oh precious little birds,  take flight in love, soar to your Heavenly Father and bring a bit of heaven down to Earth and into your hearts, [my friends.]

And so you build a haven of peace within you and around you with all the gyrations of life oblivious of God. And here you bring the sacred light of His Presence to sustain you and to warm your souls. Are we not God's instruments to help anchor the reality of God to Earth? And to bring the awareness to those who are oblivious of the great blessings and treasures that God wishes to give to each of His children? Beloveds, soar into light and bring the light of God to your world, in prayer, in your [very being] on the world.

I am Confucius. I come to bring, uplift, and vitality to each of you. May His Love continue to transform you, beloveds, and bring you ever closer to your Creator.

Beloved souls, beloved souls, you are loved beyond measure. Powerful in your light. Beautiful in your demeanor. Birds of exquisite plumage, expressing the wonderful Will of God on this Earth.

I come to uphold you. I come to greet you, and I come because I love you, my beautiful brothers and sisters.  Precious to God, and to me and to all of the angels of heaven. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
