# Humanity is Oblivious to Coming Earth Changes

August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2022

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Friends, it is Orion. Your world is in transition, and continues to shift and change in accordance to the conditions that are prevailing within this world of yours and the energies that are pouring upon it. Do you not feel and sense the changes within you? The response to these conditions and energies? How your attitudes, your thoughts, your ambitions are responding and changing in accordance to your new-found perspective, your shift in consciousness?

Now you can imagine how difficult this will be with your brothers and sisters who have no inkling, no idea that this great change is in process and will intensify in the near future. They are oblivious as they go about their business in a world that appears to them to be the same, although there are minor differences and changes in weather and other conditions that are the forewarnings of things to come.  

Yet most of humanity is content to be oblivious. They desire things to remain as they are, provided their needs are met and they are happy within their present life. And who can blame them for such an attitude if within the mind and within their physical relationship with the world they are finding a measure of contentment and fulfilment? They believe that their present condition will continue for the rest of their lives, but in truth, they are standing on the deck of the Titanic, expecting that ship to float as it continues to sink down into the waters. They see nothing wrong with their present condition, for their feet are dry, and as long as they remain oblivious with their eyes closed, that belief will be sustained. But of course it cannot be sustained, for the warning signs are there. The conditions are shifting and changing. Even those who remain oblivious have some sense of this. They see some warning signs, although they refuse to take this to heart and to consider the consequences.

We are working diligently with you, my friends, so that when the time comes you may stay afloat, and you may help others to do so as well, that you will be free from the death grip of a world that no longer exists but pulls the mind in, hoping to engage and to bring that individual to a place, an illusion of misunderstanding of what the true situation is. There are indeed dark forces which do so. Even they feel and sense the changes that are coming, and they have a sense of dread towards these changes. For have they not endured enough in these dark conditions of the spirit world? So they see more pain on the horizon, greater challenges ahead. They are not oblivious, although their understanding of the meaning of this is distorted and a reflection of their condition.

In your prayers, it is good that you say a prayer for all those in darkness, and there are many millions of spirits and mortals in darkness and confusion. This world of yours is not a happy place, itâ€™s a place of great struggle and great disillusionment. Yet, the time comes when God will uplift His children, giving them a fresh start, allowing them to see for themselves and choose for themselves something that is of a higher quality and expression of life. When that time comes, we will be close. We will most certainly manifest through you and bring needed information to the masses of people who are or will be in a state of bewilderment and fear. 

Trust in the journey, my beloved friends. Trust that God is continuing to guide you all and has a plan for each one of you that is an integral part of His plan and what is meant to manifest in the times to come. There is little you can do to help foster the great changes that are coming. Rather, there is much you can do to prepare yourselves as His instruments of love and light, so that when these manifestations take place, you are in the condition to allow them to do so. You cannot second-guess God, nor can you truly prepare in a material way to respond to what will take place. For, remember that in the process of this transformation, every day and every step will be a test that God will place before you, and as you continue to step in faith, to respond with faith, trusting in God's plan, then you are closer to your goal of alignment with the new conditions, the new world that is coming and you will find great joy and fulfilment in this.

If you allow your minds to engender fear and keep you in that condition that is of doubt and without trust in the Will of God, then you will have great struggles, my friends. Though I see within each of your souls is a light and a strength that will overcome such conditions, the intensity of your struggle and the length of your struggle will be dependent upon your choice and the many choices that come with each day. Choose well. Choose light. Choose alignment with God. Ask God to awaken you, awaken your soul in His Love. Appreciate the day that is now, the blessings that are now, and do not overly concern yourself with those things that I speak of and that others have spoken so clearly and succinctly. These things are not meant to alarm you but rather, to inform you of the fact that you need to prepare yourself spiritually for the days ahead, where you will have to rely upon your faith, your own wisdom, soul awareness, and all those aspects of yourself that are non-material but of a spiritual nature. That you may utilize these gifts,  strengths and abilities in order to cope with an ever-changing world.

These things come with the blessings of God upon you, my friends. God will not abandon you. We will not abandon you. Your angel friends will not abandon you. If anything, they will be closer than ever and will give you what you require to be in harmony with God's intentions and His plan. Thus, you may sail through these tumultuous times with a sense of purpose and direction, with a true perception of the steps intended upon your path, and the instrumentality that God utilizes through you to help uplift and save those children who are experiencing these difficulties, and challenges. 

Much will be given, my friends, and know that you will be supported, uplifted, and embraced in love and light. You will not go hungry or thirsty, either in the material sense or the spiritual. You will find your way, and you will respond to the great nurturance of our Creator.

May God bless you, my friends, as you continue to journey toward greater light, greater truth, greater love. It all flows to you. It is for you to engage and to respond to that which God is giving you, every moment of every day. God bless you my friends, I am Orion. I'm happy to be with you today, to be with you in prayer and be with you in your longings and your desire to be God's instruments, God's channels, God's lights in the world. 

God bless you, beloved friends. God bless you deeply, fully, and powerfully, with His Essence. Awaken and be free from the tyranny of the human condition, the tyranny of the mind so conditioned to that which is not in harmony with God, and free from your own pain so that you may know great joy. Blessings to you, my friends. Blessings and love.
