That love may make many things possible. The power of the love within your souls allows you to come together in this way. No matter where you are upon the globe, a bond of light, a lattice is created and you are connected, one to another in this beautiful Circle of Light.

Many of you wonder about the state of your souls, you wonder about the truth, you wonder about your relationship with God, and many of you have not had what you believe are sufficient answers to these questions. My beloved friends, everyone possesses a soul and that soul is longing to be with God. As you exercise your longings and your desires in prayer to your Heavenly Father, so His blessings come to awaken you, and to enfold you, and to love you.
