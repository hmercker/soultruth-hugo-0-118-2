Friends, I am Orion. I wish to speak on how your channels and gifts may be opened and the process that often accompanies this opening of aspects of your being which require effort, cleansing, healing, and love in order to be activated.

Your world, as you well know, is filled with conditions, the human condition, which is often contrary to God’s laws. In your life experiences, you have often absorbed and integrated these conditions into your consciousness, into your bodies, and into your spirit bodies. These conditions surround your soul so that it makes it difficult for you to have a clear and conscious relationship with your Creator. You wear a series of cloaks which muffle and inhibit the free flow of light through you. The gifts that you carry as God’s instruments are often inhibited by these conditions.

So, you continue to be engaged in a struggle of freedom from these conditions, releasing whatever inhibits and constricts your spiritual selves. This too can spill over into your material self and your mindful self. You are a complex creature. The world is a complex place. So, all does not flow freely but is subject to the choices that you make, the experiences that you may have in a day, the thoughts that may be created in your mind, the food that you may consume, the atmosphere and environment that is around you. So many factors influence and determine the free flow of blessings, energies, light, love to you and through you.

So, your challenge is to be vigilant, to understand that conditions change constantly and that the effort required to help disperse conditions that are contrary to light must be made almost moment-by-moment. At least the intention of reaching for the higher conditions, the highest condition, must be with you in a conscious way throughout your day if you are to truly be in alignment with God’s Will and plan for you, that all that is of the divine may be expressed through you freely, openly, and beautifully. Your efforts must be intense and consistent.

Of course, you are all human and are distracted readily and pulled away often from these goals. Yet, as you continue to grow in Divine Love, as you continue to pray, as you continue to discipline your thoughts and release those conditions of which I speak, then it becomes easier for you to be in alignment with the flow and Will of God and the great flow of love that may manifest through you in any given moment.

But still, you are somewhat reluctant, at times acquiescent, and take for granted the help and support that you get from you angel friends from God’s Touch and intention upon you. Your consciousness drifts from one thing to another as the conditions of your Earth plane continue to draw your attention. Indeed, you have ascribed to an ambitious program, one in which you may manifest the likes of your angel friends and others to the world. This is not something that can happen easily or readily in the heavy conditions of the Earth plane.

As you have been informed, we require your compliance and alignment with the conditions necessary in order to manifest as you so wish and of course, as we so desire. It is an intense program, is it not? A program that continues to draw your attention each and every day. It is important for you to realize that the depth of this commitment is great, although not all-consuming but certainly a major part of your lives at this time.

We all must be diligent, my beautiful friends. Indeed, the great impetus and focus of your diligence must be on releasing those conditions within you and around you which would inhibit the light which are contrary to the truth as you know it. I do not say these things to reprimand you but merely to remind you of the depth and seriousness of this commitment and how complex it is, affecting every part of your being. One cannot be strong in one area and weak in another and still expect that the manifestation of these gifts will come through regardless. This is not the case.

Strength and harmony must be built throughout you, beloved souls. This journey is not the journey of those who wish to establish a somewhat haphazard approach to this venture. It does require 100% of your commitment. It is important that you refresh this commitment to God often, to keep within your minds that you do indeed have a goal in life that is extraordinary and wonderful and also challenging.

You have, as you have been told many times, all the resources available to you in order to express and fulfill this great goal. But the greatest resource that you possess, beloved souls, is yourself, the power of your will, the power of your desires, the power of your soul awakening, the power of your mind in alignment with these things. So, you cannot be casual in this commitment and say “oh, I will try more tomorrow” and allow yourself to drift back into negativity, judgment, fear, inability to be above the conditions of the Earth plane.

It is easy to drift toward darkness for darkness is all around you. For those of you who still are somewhat confused or unclear as to what you are doing in regards to this venture, I say to you that you have not aligned yourself well between your soul and your mind. Thus, your mind continues to manifest a flurry of doubts, speculations, and fear in regard to this commitment that has been made.

As you continue to progress on, you will find the challenges more intense because the sensitivity and alignment toward light and harmony will intensify. You must see that in order to journey down this road, there is a price. That price is increased sensitivity, is a shift in consciousness and awareness so that what you may call normal life creates a great challenge and at times disruption toward the desired goal of harmony and light.

Prayer is your mainstay, my friends. Continue to pray often. If you feel yourself drifting away from the light, ask God to bring you back, ask your angel friends to come close, and adjust your thoughts and actions accordingly. There is so much that requires your attention, so much that may lead you away from it. But indeed, each of you are mature in Divine Love and know it well and must continue on this journey, this path in order to assure your relationship with God and with us, with all that is of light.

The time for half-haphazard and casual approaches is finished. Your commitment must be complete and powerful and true. Do not fool yourselves, my friends. Do not compromise and rationalize and all those things of the mind which often conspire to trick you into conditions that are not of light. Indeed, the influence of dark spirits continues to eagerly observe and look for cracks within you where this influence may draw you away.

Although, the resources available to you are powerful indeed, they are only as powerful as your ability and desire to draw them close to you and that indeed requires vigilance, strength, awareness, and love. Walk in the light, my friends. You are destined to walk in the light. How intense that light may be, how beautiful that journey may be, how purposeful it may be is determined by you and God’s great gift of free will that He has given you.

Choose wisely, beloved souls. Choose light always. Remember, you have embarked upon an ambitious project, one which requires your dedication, one that is predicated upon the power of the great Essence of God residing within you, that which continues to grow and deepen within your soul. Be true to this. Be clear and do not forget. Beloved souls, you are each loved by God, such depth and breadth that you cannot fathom it. You are loved by us, all of us who surround you, in purpose and in effort to uphold and uplift you. Beloved souls, continue to align yourself with light and walk in the world as a light, channel of truth and love. Blessings, many blessings for you. Do not allow those factors that are of the human condition to restrict this and strangle this. Be free, beloved souls. Be free and be in the light.

Blessings to you. I am Orion. My love and dedication are with you all. God bless you. God bless you.
