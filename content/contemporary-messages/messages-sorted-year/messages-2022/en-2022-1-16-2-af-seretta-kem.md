Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Seretta Kem. The world continues to await its awakening. The world is in great need of those who are awake. So, we continue to work with you all to help foster this awakening which is determined by your efforts and your prayers. It is important that you persist, my beloved brothers and sisters, toward the light, toward truth, toward receiving the great gift of God’s Love so that truly you will awaken, fully and completely, truly God’s children in alignment with God’s Will and plan.

It is important that there are souls who are awake because they will set off a chain reaction in the world that will awaken others, bringing many to their own souls and to their relationship with God. But first, those who are at the forefront must continue to forge ahead and continue to be earnest in their efforts. In this way, all that you desire and all that is possible may manifest through each of you beyond the limitations of your mind to the expansion and great possibilities of your soul.

It is time to allow the awakening of your soul to take precedence, to be a powerful igniter of light, of truth, of instrumentality through each of you. It is as those portals open between God and yourselves. Through yourselves, with God acting and using you as an agent, His Will and blessings, that all that is intended will be accomplished. It is not that you as an individual, a personality, will be the source of these things. Rather, it is you acting in alignment and in accordance with God’s Will, as His instruments, His channels, that these things will manifest.

So, a measure of humility, consistency, even innocence is needed in order for these things to flow unimpeded through you. You are at your most authentic, innocent, beautiful selves when you pray, when you reach out to God and your souls reaching for the blessing of God. It is you put aside those human conditions which inhibit this flow. So, we beseech you to pray more often, more diligently, to redouble your efforts, to be strong and clear and beautiful in who you are as a soul for it is the soul that will awaken. The development of the soul is your destiny. Allow your souls to take precedence. Do not allow those parts of you and those aspects of the human condition in which you are attuned to inhibit this process, this awakening. Be clear and true. Be with God. Be in that place of light, expansion and peace, where love flows freely and infills you in abundance.

We are all travelling together upon this road. I encourage you to support those who are joining you upon this journey for all are needed and all shall be used in accordance with their gifts and their souls’ progression. The work continues, my friends. We are indeed all God’s instruments and shall listen and take heed of God’s guidance and plan for the salvation of humanity. With humility and joy and grace, focus and desire, we shall awaken more fully to the Will of God, to the reality of God. So, joy will grow, wisdom will flourish, and love will reign supreme in your lives.

Beloved souls, may God bless us all as we work together to bring peace and harmony, truth and love to your beleaguered world, God’s great creation, His beloved Earth and all who dwell within. We are together upon this path and journey toward soul awakening, soul truth, soul love, Divine at-onement in Love.

God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. My love for all of you is great. We continue to grow in numbers and efforts. The time fast approaches when the plan will be revealed in such ways and means that you will see your part to play clearly and understand why you have taken this journey. The trials and tribulations, the blessings, and the awakenings all are a part of this wondrous journey toward truth and love. God bless you, my friends, keeping you in His Light, His Love, His peace, His Grace. God bless you. My love is with you all.
