Beloved souls, I am your teacher Augustine. Circles of Light are most important to create the environment, and atmosphere where other souls might come and partake of the living waters of God, that they may feel safe, nurtured, and upheld. It is important to continue with your efforts with Circles of Light whether that be on the wires or in the flesh. Whatever way and means you may do so, continue with these efforts for they are important and they will grow and multiply in times to come.

May God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you in His Light and Love. Your teacher, your friend Augustine is with you in your efforts. God bless you.
