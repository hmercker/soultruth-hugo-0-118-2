I bring to you greetings and love, my beautiful friends, I am Orion. Since you have discussed issues and commentary regarding my communications, I have come to clarify some issues and to be with you in prayer in this beautiful Circle of Light that encompasses the globe. Such a beautiful world it is, a blue world, the world that God created as a crucible for each of His precious souls to grow and thrive within. Indeed, each of you has grasped the invitation from God to grow, to expand within your souls, to be an expression of His wondrous intention that all His children, all who have and possess souls shall be in the light. So, you come together to express and affirm the light within you as you continue to receive this great gift that you call Divine Love, which is the Essence of the Great Creator’s Soul awakening and transforming your soul.

You ask about those who are a part of a small circle that has a specific intent and desire, a purpose for their gathering. Indeed, these individual souls have not attained a certain spiritual level in order to be a part of this circle. Rather, they have chosen to be a part. They were also given the invitation to be a part of this circle. There are many elements and aspects that made it possible for them to coalesce as a circle in order to bring about what they call Direct Voice, the manifestation of us upon the Earth, those from the Celestial Kingdom, the bright spirits of the spirit world and even we who are from another world. As has been described, it takes great dedication and great focus to do so, to make this a possibility. 

There are many of you who are new to these matters and some of you who are not. When we speak to this development circle, we are specifically honing our message to them in order to assist them in their development and growth as a circle. Yet, much of what we say is relevant to each of you. So, I would not suggest that you ignore our words or our guidance as has been given. Rather, to tailor the meaning and the specifics of it toward your own particular journey and effort toward the light. Of course, we could suggest this is true for any message that is given through a medium. Indeed, any message is influenced by the biases of the medium. Consequently, you must winnow through that which is given in order to formulate information that is relevant to your journey and your consciousness.

God does not exclude anyone from the journey of soul awakening, developing the soul through this great gift of Divine Love that transforms your soul. There is never any intention to exclude anyone in this regard for there are times when messages are given to specific individuals that are meant for those individuals to inspire, inform, uplift, guide, and teach. Indeed, much of the information given can be relevant to a wide circle of individuals. They are welcome to glean whatever information is given from these messages, provided that the individual is willing to share them. But the theme that runs through all messages of this calibre is the invitation to the individual to seek for the soul to be awakened through Love. This is a given. This is the platform from which we continue to build and share with each of you.

Some will hear a message from another spirit or individual that will greatly inspire them while another person may not be inspired. This can be a reflection of your personality, your individuality, and the particular road that you have taken for your spiritual journey. It may also reflect the development of your soul and its capacities to learn, grow and understand the messages that are given. Indeed, you will find if you reread a message that you might have read several years ago and have come to a different understanding of that message, more insights, and a different approach, this is a reflection of the growth within your soul and the knowledge that you have obtained through this journey.

Each of you is different and you are all on a path which God has designated for you. Accordingly. the level of attainment, understanding, and soul awareness will be unique to you. Thus, you cannot collectively understand, experience, feel, and know what is happening at any particular time in such a circle as this. If you survey each individual after such a circle, they will give you a different explanation as to what has happened within that circle. This will be a reflection of their own individuality, personality, and gifts so that they will see and know differently from another person.

Yet, you come together from all around the globe to seek the same sustenance for the soul that is Divine Love. Thus, you are bonded in this experience. Each of you yearns for this experience. Each of you shall certainly have and receive this gift from God. This experience is not exclusive but is common to every soul in the universe. The availability of this Love, this gift, this Essence, is for all souls provided that they open themselves to it and seek it.

You are all welcome and blessed in this gathering together. The scope of this circle could be in the thousands yet, all would be welcome. There are many more who are connected to this circle who are not here today in person and many more that we connect with you in these circles that are not consciously aware of it. There are many thousands of spirits who congregate together as you do for these times in prayer. So you see, the scope is wide and it is deep. There are many aspects and layers to it. You cannot expect to be an equal member in every respect with one another, for how can you be when you are unique? Yet, you are equal in the eyes of God, equally loved, equally acknowledged, and maybe equally blessed provided you are all receptive and unified in this desire to receive.

This is the Law. It is the Law in action. So, Love is free for all, is given to all who desire it, and will be blessed to all who reach out toward it. God’s Love for His children, His beautiful, beautiful creations throughout the universe is equal, profound, powerful, is meant for all, and shall be given to all who are desiring this gift, reaching out, longings toward God given from the soul, your soul to God’s Soul. This blessing is for you, beloveds, for each of you. The measure of this blessing is determined by the measure of your desire and how well you might reach out to God. Therefore, you delineate between yourselves, the level of your own progression, your own light that comes with the efforts made as well as the openness and vulnerability that you may have with God and your desire to be with God.

This is the only delineation. It is determined by each individual for the mechanisms of the universe are always present and functioning with no exclusion, no delineation, only that which is within the Laws of God’s Creation. So, when you are in alignment with these laws, the universe of God is open to you. You are empowered by your understanding, your desire, your openness, and your ability to utilize the Laws as they have been taught. So, my beloved friends, may we open ourselves to a great inflowing of the Essence of God into our souls. Open yourselves and awaken to this truth, and know that you are deeply blessed, acknowledged and loved by your Creator. 

God bless you, friends of light, children of truth, souls of God. I am Orion. My love is with you, beloved souls.
