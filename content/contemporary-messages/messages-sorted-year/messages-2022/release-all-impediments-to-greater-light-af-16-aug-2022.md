# Release All Impediments to Greater Light

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Beloved souls, I am Orion. You continue to find your way into greater light. You continue to assess the messages that have been given to you, the guidance that has been received, and the sense of your own progress within. That is most important at this time, beloveds, that you find your way to greater light, that you release all impediments to greater light. How else can you fulfill this covenant between yourself and God than to be within the Light of His Love more fully with each day, to walk in the Truth of His Love more completely with each day? It is not that one day matters and another does not. It is every day that matters, every moment that you are committed to the Truth and Light and Love of God.

You then make progress forward, inching your way through the maze of the human condition, inching your way through the challenges that are within your own life, inching your way through those patterns of thought and behaviour that are contrary to the truths you know and understand. You are upheld, my beautiful brothers and sisters. You are upheld in light. As you continue to commit yourself to this journey of the soul, so you will be upheld in light, and so you will find your way.

Do not compare yourselves with others. Rather consider your own progress. Consider how you have changed over the years. Consider your perspective now compared to many years ago, how that has changed, and how you have progressed, my beloved friends. You are certainly well on the path of soul awakening. You are certainly opening up to new ideas, thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. You are beginning to see the importance of a mind well-ordered and disciplined so that it does not interfere with your spiritual experiences and prayers. All of these things indicate great progress compared to many others on the Earth plane. You have progressed quickly and well on the path. You will find yourself quickening in your pace, your endeavours, your love for yourself and humanity, all of those things that reflect a soul in light, a soul that is awakened. So, you will find yourself at peace and know the joy of a soul well-connected to the Creator of All, a soul that knows its path and treads firmly along the road that it is destined to take.

So much opens to each of you, beloved souls, those who are present today in the circle and those who are not. Much is opening and much waiting to be opened. Have faith in the day and much opportunity that the day brings and have knowledge of your true self and what that knowledge empowers you to choose and to be in that day. Be true to God and seek the blessings and guidance that will continue to awaken your soul. Be true to one another for it is in this commitment of love and truth and well-being of one another that you will work together as great lights in the world, multiplying the power of your channels exponentially as you gather together and link together in love.

Seek to be at peace, and to not allow the conditions of the world to distract and vex you but to be at peace and know that what you strive for and how you are in the world is beyond these paltry conditions that are made by humanity and that are of darkness. These conditions are soon to disappear from the world and be replaced by light. There you will feel great joy and comfort and knowing because you are a part of this change, you are a part of this light, and you will be in the light, greater light as you progress further. As you accept and embrace the Will of God, the plan of God, so you will be in that light, the flow of His Will guiding you forward, guiding you ever closer, guiding you in greater light and greater truth.

May God bless you, my friends, on that journey. We are all together upon it. We strive to be instruments to change the world so that it may be in greater light and harmony and love. So we are together, my friends. So we are His beautiful instruments for the good of all, for the benefit of your world, for the awakening of your soul. Be at peace, my friends, and know that you are truly loved. Feel that love. Know that love. Embrace that love and all other things that are not of love will fall away and you will truly know the joy of your connection and alignment with the Creator of All. God bless you. I am Orion and I am with you, with you always, my friends. Blessings to you all in love.
