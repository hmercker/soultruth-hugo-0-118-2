# The Depth of your Desire 

April 12<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Westminster, California, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   


You might ask yourselves, "If I had the power to change things in love what would I change?" You know the expression attributed to Gandhi, but uttered by many, “Be the change you wish the world to be”, yes?  This is how I would put it. Do you wish for kindness? Do you wish the hungry to be fed? Do you wish the truths of God’s Love to be made available and visible to the many? Do you wish peace? Are you at peace? These are apt wishes and to a greater or lesser extent, doable. Let me give you an example. Let’s say you wish to learn a language because you wish to communicate with those from another land, another country, a different culture that you would like to explore, perhaps you admire it. Depending on the depth of your desire to want that, this will inform the extent to which you educate yourself and learn and take the time. 

If you look back on the things of your life that have been difficult, perhaps something you did not wish to learn at some point and later realized how important it was and how grateful now you are that you did take the time, despite all the challenges, and you put this into your spiritual lives and into what you would like to see on earth, you will become an outward sign of that particular grace, and your example will not go unnoticed, just as now, when you share your love with others, you share your stories, you share any kindness, in the great Love of God’s universe.

I am your sister in Christ, your guide, and your friend always, and I love you. I am Claire.
