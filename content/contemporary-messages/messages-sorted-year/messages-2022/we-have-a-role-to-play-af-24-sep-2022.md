May the blessings of the Father’s Love pour upon each of you, beloved children. I am your brother and friend Jesus. I come to encourage you upon your path and your efforts. It is important for you to realize that you are a part of a plan that has spanned millennia, that since my incarnation upon the earthly plane, this plan was initiated by God and continues to this day, and that many have been a part of this plan for the salvation of humanity. Many have done their part and have done so quietly and humbly. So, you take up the banner, the torch of truth to present to humanity, the way in which they may find their salvation, their soul awakened, the healing of all that is not of love.

Each of you, beloveds, brings to the table many gifts and many possibilities of instrumentality. Each of you is precious in God’s Sight and is loved by the angels of the Celestial Heavens. Each of you carries an important task to be fulfilled, a purpose in your life. Each of you has chosen to be a part of this great effort, the unfolding of God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. So, we work together, beloved souls. We work toward that which must come, to right the wrongs of the world, to bring healing to all that which is not of love, to bring balance and harmony, for each has the potential and instrumentality to contribute to these goals in a major way, to be an integral part of God’s plan. But you must come to this realization, beloved souls, that you are not merely one who is within the crowd and flow of the human condition, that you are designated and appropriated for a mission, a goal, a purpose.

So you must come to this realization, my friends, my beautiful brothers and sisters, that there is a deep purpose within your life. There is a deep purpose within your soul. So I urge you to open yourselves to God more fully, to come to realize that true self that is your soul so that you may see clearly and understand with a profound sense of knowing that you are meant to do the bidding of God, that God’s Will and purpose for you must come to its fruition, must come powerfully and deeply within you and through you so that you may fulfill these tasks that lay before you. 

It comes with the awakening of your soul through receiving the great gift of God’s Love. It does not come with the preparation of your mind in detail and words and concepts. Though these may have their validity and their purpose, it is secondary to the purpose of your soul awakening and coming into greater alignment with God. In this way knowledge comes, not from reading a book or training or exercises of mind. It comes with the awakening of the mind and the mind of the soul in all its surety and purity, the light, the love, the truth that comes with the blessing of God’s Love awakening those faculties within you that are quite capable of knowing God’s plan, knowing God’s Will, knowing God’s Truth, and knowing the truth of creation.

So much you are capable of, beloveds, as is every soul upon this world of yours and every soul in the spirit world. Yet, so few come to that place of true understanding, of true awakening. Their minds insist upon the linear path of thought and deduction and belief that this is the road to truth. Yet, this is merely a dim reflection of truth. It is for you to understand that road, beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, to understand the path toward truth, that powerful journey that will awaken you to all that is meant to be given and understood and expressed through you.

In this way, you become the harbingers of a world to come, of the new consciousness of humanity which is meant to unfold in all the trials and tribulations that humanity has endeavoured to create for itself. Yet, through this darkness comes a great light, a great unfolding of truth, a greater understanding of each true self and each in their own endeavours to awaken their great potentials and capacities of the soul. This is our work, beloved souls, you and I and many others together. we continue in the unfolding of God’s plan to awaken humanity.

May you come to understand your part within it. May you come to understand what true awakening is. May you come to know that within you are powerful potentials to bring deep insight and deep understanding that may only come from a soul that has been touched by God’s Love. You continue to cleave together in the Light of God’s Love, in the desire to fulfill your destinies in the way that you may support and uphold and love one another. So, you continue to draw the angels into your midst. You continue to draw our stellar friends who gather around with anticipation that the world may change and the world may join with others who are of this consciousness of love.

My beloved and beautiful friends, may you truly find yourselves and find your way to God in greater measure, in clear and robust prayer and efforts to be in alignment with your Creator. You will find your way, beloveds. You have all the resources you need to find your way. Allow yourselves the luxury of this journey rather than feeling the obligations of material life as your priority. Instead, put these things to God and ask God to assist you in your journey upon the earthly plane so that all will be in harmony and peace. And so it will be if you are able to listen to God’s guidance and be in harmony with God’s Will.

May His Love continue to awaken you, beloved souls. May you continue to see yourselves as you truly are, bright and beautiful children of God. So, we are truly brothers and sisters upon a magnificent path toward at-onement with our Creator. My love is with you, beloveds. I am with you. We journey together always, always together for you are never alone. You are never alone, beloveds, but you have the Touch of God upon you and the assistance of your angel friends and bright spirits and one another.

So, may you continue to uphold the truth, express the truth, and live the truth. God bless you, beloveds. I am Jesus and I am with you. I am with you and I love you. God bless you.
