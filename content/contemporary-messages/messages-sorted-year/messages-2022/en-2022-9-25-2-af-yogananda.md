Yogananda received by Al Fike

A more contemporary of your world who also wishes to come and encourage you upon your path. Yes, the journey today is not so much different from the journey of the past. Are the hurdles not the same? Are the challenges not so different from that of our esteemed brethren?

Yet, there is within your souls and the souls of many others upon this world of yours, a desire to reach forth in light and truth, a desire to overcome these barriers to God and to truly be within oneself, that place, that sanctuary that is your soul, and in this, to be in harmony with all that is God, all that is His universe. So, you continue to confront that which holds you back and yet you continue to be blessed continuously with love and light and truth. Your friends in the Celestial Kingdom make great effort to help you to awaken, to encourage you, to pray with you. You have great forces working with you to bring you to greater light and understanding and truth. How blessed you are my friends, how very blessed.

May you come to see and acknowledge and appreciate what God is doing for each of you to help you upon the road of enlightenment. I too, put myself to the wheel, pushing, pushing to help you out of the mud and into the clear ground, to travel safely and quickly towards the truth, towards your own awakening and enlightenment. Many more are there assisting you, assisting each of you.

Be true to yourselves, beloved souls, be true to what you know is truth, and in this you will find your way. In this, the faith within you will grow, the understanding will blossom, and you will reach that goal of enlightenment in time. But indeed, the road is filled with pitfalls, and you must persevere. For, how else can you move forward? The only alternative is backwards, and I am sure that none of you wish to travel in this direction.

So, we all persevere, and we all look forward to what is awaiting us, what is beautiful, wondrous in its glory, its blessing, its truth. Seek the great empowerment of Godâ€™s Love and be freed by His Gift. I am your friend, Yogananda. My love is with you all and I too, join you in this great journey. Blessings to you, fearless and powerful friends of truth. God bless you.
