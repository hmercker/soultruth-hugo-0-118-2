Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



I am here Care. Fall into Grace and be lifted in God’s love. It is a matter of the heart. This you can do if you align your will with the Heavenly Father’s. He will open your soul. As you let go of everything that separates you to be in the stillness of His light and love. Breathe out any darkness. Allow God’s grace to descend upon you. May God love be yours and His peace be with you in this blessing. How I love you … You cannot count the ways. God bless you. I am Care.
