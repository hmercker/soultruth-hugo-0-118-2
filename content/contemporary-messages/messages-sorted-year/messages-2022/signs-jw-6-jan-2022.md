I am here Judas. My dear ones you have come a long way from humble beginnings to a state of Grace, a place of gratitude not only for the Father's Love, but for your gifts as they blossom in each one of you.
 
I have been with this brother a good part of today impressing upon him to watch for signs in connection with the guidance he wishes to receive.  But I shall put this in the larger context for all here. The prophets of old often talked of signs and the Master spoke of signs both in the affirmative and negative, as when the sign is being a way to see and yet one is not activating the message given in a sign. 

It is very common for those who have loved ones in spirit to associate a particular thing (object) as a sign of their loved one’s presence. This could be a butterfly or a rose or a feather or even a sign in nature as in the wind or a certain light. It could also be a warning sign. As you may know the animal world is very sensitive to earth changes, to the coming of storms, and so forth. In olden days, if I may use that term, or let me say in indigenous cultures, people paid attention to the animals and signs.
 
Jesus once asked, and I will paraphrase, *‘Are you so enamored with the signs that you need them in order for you to believe’?* And this was a fair question in the context of that situation. To put it into present company, I would say when you see a sign, especially one that signifies the presence of a loved one, and most particularly of an angel, open your heart and say a little prayer that your soul may be able to perceive the meaning of the presence of that one and what is attempting to be communicated. For instance, it may be a confirmation of something you wondered about, or it may be a direction in which take. A way to follow guidance about something you were considering, pondering; shall I do this or that, go this way or that? 

An angelic sign will cause your heart and your soul to know and relay it to your mind. When this happens, you are encouraged to take action to avoid regretting not following your guidance in that moment. So, let me add that there are always signs and just the fact that one is open, paying attention is a step in the right direction. So I ask you to take a step further to consider the deeper import behind the sign. 

I hope this is helpful to you and I thank you for your wonderful work and your continued commitment to moving forward in the progression of your souls in the love of God. What a great thing it is and how great God is in His love for us. May you hold this in your heart. I will come and give you more in times ahead, but I can tell you there are so many who wish to thank you, to encourage you, to walk with you on this path in the love of God.

I am your brother and true friend in Christ, I am Judas.
