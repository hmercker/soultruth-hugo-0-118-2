# Creating Avenues of Love

August 25<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Lightbringers, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my friends, it is indeed Professor Salyards. Opening up avenues of love, that is what you are here to do, my friends, allowing the flow of love into the lives of those who are connecting to you, awakening them to the truth, bringing them to God. May you incorporate the many ways and means that this may be done, that you may use your imaginations, that you may put forward your efforts, your time, your focus to make possible, these events and experiences. For when you lead others into a gathering with the intention of opening to God and to receive His Divine Love, so you open the way to Love. You open the way to Light and to Truth and the great blessings of God upon these individuals.

I know you have technical things that you must consider and incorporate into this ambitious program, but I say to you that the focus must be upon the opportunity for others to come to know the Touch of God, that you, through being guided by God and the angels, will be facilitators to that experience, although as you certainly know, you cannot force this upon another. But what is imperative is that you open yourself as a channel of Love so that others may be blessed. It is not about your needs, your good welfare, my friends. It is about being a servant of God, of being true to God's Will and God's plan. So, with this openness and attitude that you share together, the possibilities of service will be made evident and clear.

When there are great restrictions and barriers in your way, know that this is an indication that it is not part of God's Will, it is merely your will being imposed upon it and upon these works that you propose. You have had a good example of how being in the flow of God's Will will facilitate a great many things. Your gathering was a success and it was harmonious, and many want more of the possibilities of future gatherings of Light, teachings of truth, the flow of God's Love as you sit together in prayer.

So I urge you, my beloved friends, to go into prayer and to think of how and what God will use you, in what way, in what manner, and that God will guide you along that path and you will feel the harmony of it. There is no need to worry and fret about how God's Will may be manifest. Rather, it is a matter of attitude that suggests I am willing, I embrace my beloved Father in heaven with joy, and I wish to serve. In this way all things are possible. In this way, God will guide those whom you need to support you and have gifts that are part of the flow of Love and the Will of God manifest on the earthly plane. So much is possible when you are in the flow of God's Will and seeking the guidance of God. As you step forth with humility, with love, trust, desire, you will receive much in the way of guidance and inspiration. Remember that God can always guide those who are seeking the highest and are open to His Will.

Every day is a test of this, beloved souls. Every day you have the opportunity to open yourself to the Will of God and the blessings of God. I urge you every day to do so, to be in that light and flow of Love. To be in harmony with God's Will and plan will bring to you many opportunities to serve, to work for the fulfillment of this plan, avenues of love, openings of light and truth, blessings of all that God has to give to you and to others. It truly is a simple way. As you subscribe more fully to this way, so the doors will open wide and so the opportunities will flood into your little crucible of action, your organization that desires to serve. We will be there with great enthusiasm and love and joy, for we are anxious to serve as you are anxious to serve. We desire the flow of God's Will to be manifest upon the earthly plane, and so it will through you, beloved souls, and through many others.

Walk upon these avenues of love with the intention of service, of embracing humanity, of acknowledging and appreciating all the differences, all the unique qualities and characteristics of your brothers and sisters, of one another. May you work together in harmony, my friends. Find your way through the maze of human thought to that place of Divine inspiration and truth that comes to you as you pray each day. So you awaken more fully to it and you will come to know God's Will as second nature to your own, and there will be the collaboration required, there will be the harmony manifest, there will be love flowing abundantly.

May God bless you, my friends, I am Professor Salyards, and I am eager to serve and to work with each of you, to manifest the Will of God upon this Earth, to be in harmony and alignment with it. So we travel forward, and so the doors will open, and so we will recognize this great Avenue of Love as we walk forward in light. Blessings to you, my friends, blessings and love to you who are dear of heart, beautiful lights of soul, and wondrous servants. May God bless you in His Love, awaken you and show you the way. I thank you, beloveds, for your efforts, your consistency, and your persistent efforts to manifest what began as a dream from one dear soul and will come as a reality for many. God bless you. My love is with you, God bless you, my friends.
