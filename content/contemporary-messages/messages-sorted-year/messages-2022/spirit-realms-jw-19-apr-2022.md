# The Spirit Realms 

April 19<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Palm Desert, California, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   


I am here your brother in Christ, the Monsignor, Robert Hugh Benson. My brother, I am pleased with what you received the other day to make those souls aware of what [Anthony Borgia channeled through me.](https://new-birth.net/mediumship/anthony-borgia-and-the-spirit-books-he-authored/) For even those on the Divine Love path would do well to read the descriptions of life here in spirit as you are doing. Is this not helpful? And you can see I always allude to progression to the higher realms where I now reside. I am very grateful that you are sharing what I received, for when you compare it to what information is available to most mortals, even my humble revelations are nothing short of astounding. And I would say they provide a good balance with what you have read from Robert Lees and Padgett and Owens and others, certainly Judas. What a great soul he is!  And he is one of the guardians of your group watching over you with for lack of a better words, *‘great delight’,* as we all are. 

So, yes you can call me monsignor if you like though that title here is more of a reminiscence than an actuality, but to be considered a spiritual monsignor is a great honor. 

May every blessing be yours as you stay on this journey to God’s kingdom on the path of Divine love the pure intentions of your souls reaching the highest heavens and the Creator. Let your aspirations soar, for one day you will join us in the realization of your souls’ desire in the Celestial Kingdom where the love of God is in all. May God continue to bless you, heal you. I am your brother and friend, once a monsignor on earth and now an inhabitant of the Celestial heavens and happy to be your spiritual guide. I am a monsignor of the soul. Robert Hugh Benson. God bless you and may His peace be upon you.
