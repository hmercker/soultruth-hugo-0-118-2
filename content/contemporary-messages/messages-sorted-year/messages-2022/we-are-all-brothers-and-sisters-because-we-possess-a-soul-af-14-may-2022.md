# We are All Brothers and Sisters Because We Possess a Soul

Brothers and sisters of the Earth, I am Orion. I am not of the Earth. I am of a place far away, but we are of light. We have the kinship of possessing a soul and so we are all brothers and sisters because we all possess a soul. 

Though the journey of humanity is different from the journey that we have taken, we are connected. Even your scientists are beginning to understand that there is a profound link and connection between all elements in the universe, not just elements of your Earth or your planetary system but all that is created in the universe. In this way, we feel a kinship, a deep connection with you. 

We are here to assist you as you continue to struggle and strive for greater harmony and light upon this plane of existence. We have been invited by the high spirits and angels, as you call them, who are endeavouring to uplift all upon this Earth and within the several spheres of the spirit, the entire conglomerate which is life on this Earth and the dimensions of life beyond this Earth but still part of it.

So, we have been called as others have been called to help in the evolution, the shift of consciousness of your Earth plane. In this, we understand that you have many challenges. But in the plan that is of the Creator, doors and opportunities will be open for humanity to pursue truth and to truly understand your own nature and potentials and capacities. 

At this time, the human race is very proud of itself, what it has accomplished. It has built many things. It believes it knows many things and continues to journey upon a trajectory that is, in truth, leading to the destruction of your world for there is a great imbalance upon your world. The desire and egos of those in power strive to control and to direct the course of humanity. In this, they gain great power. They control many resources. They take much from your Earth. Thus, the imbalance is on many levels. 

There are many who are suffering, who live lives which are bereft of many necessities. This is not in balance with God’s plan or creation. This is not the reality that God has imposed upon the Earth. Yet, humanity continues to build its own reality, its own perspective, its own vision and is able to do so because each individual is able to exercise free will. This is a law in the universe that every being that possesses a soul also possesses the capacity for free will, to choose, to choose with every breath, with every thought, with every deed. The choice is given and that choice is exercised by all beings in the universe.

Unfortunately, many upon your Earth plane exercise free will without wisdom or knowledge. Rather, they are motivated by self-interest and self-gratification, not thinking of their impact and influence upon the greater body of humanity. They do not understand that they have great responsibility that comes with the great gift of life. They are not taught this as children. They are not shown this as adults. Rather, many stumble through life with a superficial understanding of its purpose without going deeper and seeing for themselves that there is a greater purpose to life and that each is given the opportunity to contribute to life in such a way that greater harmony is developed and upliftment of all may come with the collective efforts of humanity to bring that which is in harmony and in alignment with truth and with love.

The efforts of the high spirits, the celestial angels, and your friends beyond this Earth plane is to teach the truth of love, the power of love, the necessity of love. It is important that each individual comes to understand that when they are able to harness the power and flow of love within their own life, they are contributing to the world, they are contributing to their own experience of the world. 

So, we come as do many to help teach this one fundamental truth, that love has a great power and love may bring many things to the consciousness of man, given that the individual is in alignment with this great truth. But many do not want to humble themselves. Many are fearful. Many grab onto whatever lever of power that they can bring to themselves in order not to be vulnerable, so to feel safe within their minds. Yet, to come to love is to come to that tender place within, that vulnerable place. Beyond vulnerability is a great door that may open to each individual. Beyond that door are many secrets, many wondrous things, many experiences, many blessings that will bring that individual to higher consciousness and greater understanding of the meaning of life and the potentials that life brings.

Unfortunately, humanity tends to categorize and isolate one aspect of research or experience of life from another. In this boxing up of an individual’s life, they do not understand that all of life is continuous and may flow together in a beautiful rhythm, a music if you will, that will bring the individual to higher consciousness and greater wisdom. Instead, with this segmentation of knowledge, much is lost in the spaces between. 

When love is present and those aspects of understanding and consciousness are drawn together and meld together into one stream of consciousness, therefore bringing an understanding that all life is indeed interconnected and that all truth is available through these interconnections. The consciousness of the soul is something that humanity does not truly understand. With the teaching of how to access the consciousness of the soul, not the mind but the soul, then these things of which I speak may come readily to the individual’s consciousness. It is going deeper and beyond the mind that is the challenge of humanity at this time. I have no doubt it is the challenge of each of you, to get beyond that solid, restrictive part of you that has been so well-cultivated over the years, so well that you believe that this is who you are. But I tell you, my friends, you are much more than this.

Yes, the mind has many potentials and can do many things but it is only a fraction of human potential. When the soul is engaged, as it must, then so much more is available to the individual in their pursuit of truth, their understanding of the world, their experience in life, their relationships with others, all those things that are so important for the individual to come to realize and express in their life. 

The greatest power of love comes from God, the Source of All Love. I urge you, each of you, to seek that Source for this is the one great avenue of the soul that once opened and travelled, will bring you to the consciousness of God. In this, you will come to tap into the resources that God has to give to each individual, through this opening, this channel of consciousness that comes when the soul is given the opportunity to exercise itself and to come to its Creator and to dialog and experience this relationship with the Source of All.

So much is waiting for every individual soul. Unfortunately, so many are drowning in the superficial consciousness and condition that is of the human experience. God is waiting for the individual soul to make the choice to go deeper and to come to understand the finer qualities and aspects of their being. Each of you are given this invitation. Each of you may choose to go beyond the restrictions of your mind and come to be in the expansiveness of the soul and awaken to it, feeling the glory, the joy, the infinite possibilities that may come with this awakening.

Seek the Essence of God to empower you along this journey for this is the fuel of the soul. It is the nourishment that will awaken the soul and will come to open deeper, greater consciousness which is what each of you seek. Each of you want to know the truth. Each of you have come here in hope of finding some aspect of truth. So, we feed you that which we would feed a child. This knowledge, so simple and so basic, but in your world, unknown by the vast majority.

I urge you to contemplate my words and the words of those who speak to you from higher realms and galaxies far away but who come with compassion and love for all who are struggling to know truth and to know themselves. So, we are brothers, sisters all upon a great journey, a journey of awakening, of truly knowing one’s self, of truly knowing one’s purpose in life, of truly knowing the wonderment of life. In this, great joy wells up and the further curiosity and desire to carry on through the multiplicity of experience of life and to truly understand, to truly be the individual that you are meant to be, to truly be empowered with love.

My friends, you are upon a great journey. The world is on the brink of great change. May you find your way as God opens doors, as the universe implores humanity to step forward into light, as that which is a contradiction to the flow of universal forces and intention are slowly being wiped away and something new and wonderful comes in its place.

As you experience this in your life, and you will do so, then you will come to know forces and beings and lights that are beyond your imagination and you will come to join forces with that which is of light to help establish greater harmony in your world. Each of you desires this. Each of you sees the great inequities and imbalance in the world. Each of you knows that this is not what is meant. So, God is imploring you, we are imploring you and your soul is imploring you to step forward and be an active agent in this world. To be guided and shown the way, empowered and know the truth, to be a clear and beautiful channel in the world.

When your day comes to enter into the next phase of life, the spirit world, may you look back and say *“I have contributed. I have done my part to help uplift humanity, to help encourage it forward toward greater harmony and love.”* Is this not something that each of you might do in your own way upon your own journey?

I thank you for listening to me, my friends. I hope that I have instilled some inspiration and insight. I hope that you may move forward in your life toward greater light and truth. If you do so with the intention of bringing a most wondrous outcome of your efforts in life, you will draw to you the many bright spirits and angels and others to assist you on the journey. May the blessings of God be upon you, my friends. May His Love find its way into your soul. May you come to see yourself as a soul, a soul that is seeking at-onement with God for this is what all souls seek yet that journey is infinite and extraordinary and wondrous.

Blessings to you. I am Orion and my love for each of you, each of you a precious soul. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
