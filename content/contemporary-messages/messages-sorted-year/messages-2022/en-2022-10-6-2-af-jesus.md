October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Pacific Coast Soul Awakening Tour, Menifee, CA, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

May the Father's Love continue to inflow into your souls. Beloved and precious children of God, I come, I am your brother and your friend, Jesus. I come to be with you in prayer, and know that I am with you often as you seek out the Father and His Blessings of Love.

Indeed, as you earnestly pray for this gift from God and all that comes with His Touch that you draw to you the highest of angels, the greatest of blessings, in accordance to the intensity of your desire, the earnestness of your need. God does not deny any of His blessings to His children, for God wishes to give all in bountiful measure to those who seek and yearn for His Touch.

That moment of Holy Communion can be at any time, and I urge you to take moments in your day where you may seek God and say a prayer for His Touch upon you. I urge you to ask God to open the gifts which reside within your soul that as you receive this gift may it not only transform you, but open you to all that is within, and that your consciousness may flourish in love, your understanding of truth may be clear, and a bright light of understanding merge within you, and that all that is of God may be gifted in love.

As you traverse the road of your life, know that God has for you all that is good, all that is glorious, all that is of love. Be redeemed in love, beloveds, and that the glories of this blessing upon you.

I come to uplift you, to assist you in your awakening and your transformation. The deep healing of God upon you, the peace that passes all understanding with you, beloved souls, you are blessed, indeed.  Blessed mightily in the Great Truth of God's Love.

Awaken beloveds, may the veil be pushed aside and you may truly see and feel, hear, and know, the glories of God. God bless you and keep you in His Love. I am with you, never to leave your side, and I love you. Beloved children of God. Beloveds, I love you.
