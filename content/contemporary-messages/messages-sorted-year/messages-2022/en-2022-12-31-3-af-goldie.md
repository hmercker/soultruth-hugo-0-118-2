# Be JOYFUL in the Blessing of God’s Love!

December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2022

Direct Voice, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

I want to encourage you to have fun in your life for joy is an element of life that is often neglected by people. Yet, joy brings more light and more joy. Encourage joy in your thoughts and your actions. When you pray, be joyful. When you live your life, may it be lived in joy for in this way, you honour God by igniting the feelings of your soul expressed in life for the true feeling of your soul is joy. Joy and love, joy and love, these are the keys to a good life.

May the coming year be full of these things. May you come to know that joyful part of yourself in all its beautiful aspects, all that is within you expressed in light. Harmony will reverberate out into the world as joy is expressed, a resounding bell deep within saying to the world *“I am alive and I am joyful in the acknowledgment of life”*. May God bless you, beloved souls, and know that I love you and am with you often. I hope to bring joy to you as a blessing and a gift. I love you. I am Goldie and I love you, each one, a joyful expression of God, unique and beautiful, glorious and wondrous. God bless you, beloved souls. I love you.
