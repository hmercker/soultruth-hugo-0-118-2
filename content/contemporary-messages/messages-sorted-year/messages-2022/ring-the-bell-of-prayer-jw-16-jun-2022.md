As the changes on the earth become more drastic, as the physical and spiritual polarities become more extreme, you can see so many attempting to just avoid the obvious, side-step it as if it was not occurring. And then there are those who wish to hang on to their beliefs, those who are willing to create violence to reach their goals. I tell you it takes great courage to stay in grace. It takes great focus to be calm in the midst of the storm, to feel the peace of God’s love while so much is swirling around you, so much negativity in the air, so much unconsciousness. 

Have pity on those who suffer. This love, this Divine Love, opens the heart in empathy for all of God’s children. This is all that is required. This prayer, this openness, this asking, *“Dear God, touch my soul with your love. Heal me in body, mind, transform my soul.”*
    
As always, we ask you to stay on this walk with us and in those moments when you’re in fear, in doubt, worried, angry, out of harmony, ring the bell of prayer. Stop, take that moment to be in rapport with your Creator and you will see the difference that the love of God makes. This you know, this you can live. With all my love and blessings, I am your eternal friend and brother in the celestial heavens, a follower of the master, a transformed soul, I am Judas. God bless you!
