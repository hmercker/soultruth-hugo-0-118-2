# Staying Awake  

June 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Marietta Valley, Wisconsin, U.S.A.

Consider me the spiritual grandfather of this one I speak through. I thought I would drop in today to see how you were doing and my soul was pleased to hear the readings, the effort to be spontaneous, and to keep things ever anew. You may consider these things you are studying, these words full of substance, to be Gospel. For every message, every poem, every story that proclaims the love of God and draws the soul in with the beauty of that magnet, is Gospel. 

I encourage you to continue to find ever new ways of staying awake, for the human condition wishes to rest in somnambulant life, and those who pray with mere words, fall into this trap. Those who repeat the same routine, the same ritual, the same prayer, always at the same time, have to be jolted, awakened.  I see that each one of you knows this deep down and therefore you continue to pull a rabbit out of the hat as they say from the wellspring of truth in ever awakening in the love of our Creator.
   
I was touched by the love of God while on earth and I found the truth of it by digging deep through ancient traditions that in some places were alive and well, though hidden. In a sense in your world, the great truth of God’s love seems hidden from humans ever clinging to their ancient beliefs, religions, routines, rituals, that are much in error. Whatever truth you can find in any tradition, whatever message that comes in anew, send this out to the world as you send yourselves out. Even if you are confined you can touch many with your illumined hearts, your blessed souls.
   
So, my dear ones I commend you. You have the support of the Celestial kingdom in your efforts to progress and to share the great truth of God’s love with humanity. So be it!
  
I am your brother in Christ and a redeemed soul in the Celestial heavens. I am George Gurdjieff. May God bless you.
