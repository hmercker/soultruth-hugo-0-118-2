# The Resources of Our Souls Help Open Doors to the Universe

October 4<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Pacific Coast Soul Awakening Tour, Menifee, CA, USA

Orion received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, seekers of truth, I am Orion. I come to you because you are receptive to my presence and my words and the light that I bring. For when your soul is imbued with light, wherever you go in the universe, and indeed even you have travelled, my friends, to other places, I have escorted you to my home world. Each of you have travelled, and you bring your light with you, your souls imbued with the Great Light of God's Love.

So you grow in this light and you glow ever brighter in this light, and your capacities and gifts grow with this light. So why would it not be possible for you to travel in your sleep state? Not only through the spheres of spirit in accordance to your own progression, but also to other places in the universe, provided you are assisted and directed thus, so that you may know these places and know the possibilities that exist in this wondrous universe of God's Creation, its many dimensions, its many wonders expressed, manifest, so that you may know them, experience them, experience many other souls who are also of light. The Law of Attraction draws you to these places of light, and God wishes for you to know all of His universe, all that which is of His universe. So we assist you in understanding and experiencing these many things.

Remember that without a soul eager to join in with the truths of the universe and awaken to the one great truth and power that is God's Essence transforming and expanding your own soul, for with this comes many experiences, many surprising encounters, that you may see and know through the eyes of your soul, the faculties of your soul, the wonders of God's Creation.

When you carry love within your soul, my friends, that great Love that is eternal, so you draw many things to you and you are able to open many doors of understanding and of experience that your soul is able to comprehend, to draw to itself, to open to those things that are far beyond the mental capacities of the material world. In time, humanity will learn to open these doors and avenues of exploration. Rather than use mechanical means to travel to the universe, they will come to understand that they may use the spiritual capacities and gifts that God has given them to make these travels possible in the blink of an eye, spontaneous and amazing in their scope. The dexterity of the soul may indeed bring you many opportunities to know and to grow within the universe.

Yes, you are yet babes in the wood, not yet ready to truly experience and utilise these gifts to any great degree, but each of you have been given the gift of the crystal within you, and this has allowed you to join us in such experiences and travel. You have allowed yourself to be in harmony and alignment with these higher laws and deep blessings that come through your friends from other planets and aspects of the universe.

Yes, many things flower and open spontaneously as you continue to grow in your souls. Many opportunities are yet to come. But know in the harmony and power of God's Love, there are many, many blessings, many openings, and many experiences that are difficult to comprehend, yet are in harmony with God's Creation and Laws. Humanity sits on the edge, the verge of discovering, of coming to know their great potentials and the possibilities of creating and co-creating a world that does not draw heavily upon the natural resources of this world. Rather, to come to utilise their inner resources and the higher dimensional aspects of their existence and the existence of the universe.

Drop-by-drop, my friends, you will come to realise the wondrous capacities of your being, and come to utilise this understanding to help secure a life that is in greater harmony with God. The very foundation of all that is in harmony with God is Love, and so we urge you to seek this love and these blessings that come from God. In this way you set the stage for many other discoveries and experiences that are far beyond what you can imagine and are in harmony with God's Creation and His Laws.

We do not overpower you with experiences that are too intense and too startling for your limited capacity to perceive and understand. Rather, we feed you like a mother does a child, gently but with deep intention and direction. Thus, we join the high spirits, Celestial Angels, and the Creator Himself in this great venture to help you to awaken, my friends, to help you to see clearly, to remove those scales from your eyes, those biases of your mind, those fears and reticence that come because a world such as yours distorts the truth so readily.

When many think of us from other worlds, their imaginations create monsters and those creatures with ill intent. Yet, nothing can be further from the truth. We are like you, we are God's children like you. We possess a soul like you, a body similar to yours, and with all the higher intentions and efforts that we make on your behalf, it is always to your benefit and your upliftment, for we require nothing. Yet, we have much to give, and so we do so, in the ways and means that are in harmony with your development and your progression.

Seek the highest blessing of all, my friends, seek the highest blessing of all, and as has been said many times, all other things will follow in its stead. Seek the Love of God and you will know the great universe of His Creation, the great wonderment that is life in many aspects and dimensions, its variations. The stance of Creation is magnificent and full of wonder. I thank you, my friends, for listening to me today. For as these two dear souls travel in your world, they bring many of us with them, and we are here to speak, to inspire, to assist you in seeking and knowing your higher self, your great soul, and to develop your gifts and capacities for the good of your light in this world. Thank you and may God bless you. I am Orion, and I come in love and acknowledgement of my dear brothers and sisters who seek something higher and greater and brighter in their lives. Blessings to you, my friends, and to all who seek the truth. God bless you and keep you in His Love.
