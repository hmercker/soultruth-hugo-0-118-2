Augustine received by Al Fike

…of God, I am your teacher, Augustine. May you continue to reach for the light and seek the great benediction of God’s Touch upon your soul. For this is your birthright, beloved souls, this is your birthright. For, God has opened the floodgates of His Love upon humanity, and you feel and touch this blessing as it continues to pour forth and touch each one of you.

This is your strength, to feel and know and seek this great blessing for your soul. This is the wisdom of your soul informing you of the truth and inspiring you forward. You do not truly understand the strength and light that is within you, but it continues to urge you forward, does it not? It continues to open your eyes to that which is God’s Reality. Though, many firmly keep their eyes shut and turn away from this reality and truth, you are eager to awaken to it and to live by it. Beloved souls, because of your eagerness and your dedication, God continues to send His angels into your midst and to inspire you to receive and be open to His Love, this great blessing from above.

My beloved brothers and sisters, seek not the distractions of your world, for that time is ending soon enough and you must adapt and acclimatise yourself to a new way of life, a way that is much simpler but filled with many blessings. For, as you continue to step back from the material world and the human condition, so you are becoming used to that new world and that new way of life which includes God, includes the wisdom and expression and counsel of your soul. For, it is your soul that is in alignment with God, and it is your soul that will convey all that God has to give you in wisdom and truth.

So, you must listen, my friends. So, you must listen to that still voice within. For though it is quiet and subtle, it is powerful and transformative. It engages truth in ways that your mind cannot. It brings to you that which you cannot perceive in other ways. So you must be attuned to your soul. You must allow the awakening to envelop you in all ways, in all levels of awareness of consciousness, that the minds within you may merge as one and that in this merging you will have ready access to the Truth of God and all that God has to give to you. I know you long for this, my friends. I know you pray for this often. I know you seek to have the wisdom that is of the Divine Countenance and Source. So, you do to some extent, you open gradually. As the sun reaches over the horizon and floods the world with light, so your soul is being flooded with light, slowly but surely. As your world turns, as the sun appears, so your soul is growing and bringing that which you need and desire and require for your efforts to be channels of love and light in the world.

Beloved souls, be at peace and know that you are surrounded by the angels of the Celestial Heavens, that God’s Touch is firmly upon you and your feet firmly grounded upon the Divine Path. Thus, you are assured a place in heaven in time. Thus, you shall make that journey, and nothing will hold you back, beloved souls, nothing can hold you back. For you have established your commitment and your journey to God, at-onement, transformation, truth, and light. These things will bring great joy to you, my beloved souls. These things shall bring all of which I speak to you, to receive and to know.

Beloved souls, be at peace and know that God is with us at this time, and God shall continue to bring His Holy Touch upon your soul and awaken you thusly in your journey, your travels towards light and truth. Beloveds, be at peace and know that you are loved. I am your teacher, Augustine. I pray with you this day so that you may receive the great benediction of the soul and that you may be blessed in light and that these two beautiful souls may journey forth in their service in light and a blessing, to uplift and uphold and to envelop them in protection and to inspire them so that they may speak the truth wherever they may be, wherever they may go.

God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you. Remember to pray for your brethren as they venture forth. For as they step forward, so do you, beloved souls, so do you in this great effort and journey of truth. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
