Peter received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Peter. I bring you a message from your Heavenly Father from whom the love is great for all of His children. You seek to know the Father’s Will. It is now as it always has been, that you bring yourselves closer, closer to His Soul, and you do this with humility and trust and of course, Divine Love. Your free will choice is all you need and our dear Heavenly Father will do the rest: create the circumstances, bring the Love, assist you, instruct His Celestial Angels to guide you. All of this is available to you. It is your choice, your free will choice, and it is God’s Will that you come closer to the Love, much, much closer, for there is so much Love for you. It is just waiting for you to exert your free will and say, *“Yes, I am coming, Father. I am coming to you.”*

You have so much more that you may give to this effort, to walk this path. Yes, it’s an eternity of walks, each step fully grounded in this Love. There is no turning back. There is no going back at all, only forward. Such wisdom has the Father that we can only go forward. Such Love that His Will is that you come home to Him and enjoy all the benefits of having been created, lived a life upon the Earth exercising your free will, choosing to walk a path that you currently walk, becoming brighter and brighter as your soul transforms.

Such a path! Each individual path is truly guided by the Father and we, at His request, come to assist. How fortunate are you? How beloved are you? You possess Truth, Divine Love, faith, you may also possess the Father’s Will within you. Just exert your will, your free will choice, and ask God for this blessing. I am Peter. God bless you all.
