My dear brothers and sisters may the light of God’s Love fill your souls and bring you the lightness of being as you let go of the weight of the world.  Allow the Love of God to lift you up and discard all that baggage that you felt kept you safe. 

When one thinks of addictions, generally the mind goes to the obvious: alcohol, drugs, fame, money, sex. These are large, and they loom large in the world. And yet, there are those who only ask for a meal, clean water, warm clothing, and their prayers are true. In this world where you live,  a world of convenience, it is easy to be blindsided and live in overindulgence rather than the simplicity in your connection with God. You may be addicted, for instance, to an abusive relationship, that has made you feel unworthy and unable to break away. It may be food that brings you comfort, however short-lived, yet those things in your lives that are selfless acts for the benefit of others bring such a blessing to the world, as they enrich your soul and bring joy to your heart. 

So, you awaken on any given day, giving gratitude to your Creator for your safety, for the loved ones in your life, for a roof over your head, and whatever material possessions you need. And in this gratitude, you walk out into the world—the busy world, all caught up in politics and the ways of the material world and you have this gratitude which is worth a million bucks, and you feel a need to share it with every soul because your prayer has carried into your day and you are now in the flow, in harmony with God’s Love, with God’s Laws, forgetting your own troubles whatever was your concern. Your only wish now is to share this wealth with every soul you meet. Whatever they need, you give. And as you go through your day, you are enormously blessed, more so than even those you gave to because you are walking in the Love of God and in the light. The light of being lifted above the weight of the world, and in that harmony that you have been giving all day. So, at the end of the day, you give thanks for every blessing, for being able to give something beyond your pocketbook, material possessions, the great golden gift of Divine Love which is priceless. This Gift will change the world, this gift you all possess, and so you know the truth of my words. 

This message is beyond the circle, for all. Yes, in materials give what you can, for there are so many in need. And the addictions you have for goodness and giving, do not abandon.

Lastly, I wish to remind you that even your prayer time is sometimes just a repetition, at the same time every day, the same words. And though it may bring calm and peace, which are good things, I would suggest the spontaneity, at any moment, of thanking God, of being in gratefulness. This prayer will bring the Love into your soul in a great flood, washing away all else. Dive deep in those waters. 

My dear brothers and sisters, you are a blessing and I thank you once again for taking my words to heart. I am your brother and friend, for all eternity. I am Yogananda. May God bless you.
