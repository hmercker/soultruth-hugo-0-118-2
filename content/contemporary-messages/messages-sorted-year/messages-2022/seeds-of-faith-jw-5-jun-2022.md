My dear brothers and sisters in the love of God, it is I, Care. 

When you witness the planting of a seed in your garden becoming a seedling, becoming a flower or a fruit or perhaps a tree, and as it grows so does your faith in knowing that this tiny seed you have planted will reach its fulfillment, its purpose. You all have planted many seeds. Some of course will fall on fertile ground and perhaps others will linger, dormant for a time. For many times the conditions are not quite right for growth, but nevertheless you have planted the seeds, and you have faith the God will do the rest. 
   
We watch your souls blossom with every prayer as you walk this world with so many in darkness, in despair, you bring them light. Your presence brings them hope. The fire of God’s love touches each one beyond any words you may say, for it is your gift. I tell this, that you not be concerned with how many will blossom, how many will respond. For you have laid the groundwork and we here begin to see a real community with a strong foundation and amidst much diversity, the unity of Oneness drawing you together in the love of God.
   
So, have faith and trust that all these things that you have requested will be fulfilled in God’s time. May all your dreams come true on this path of Divine love we are with you. 
   
I thank you for allowing to come through and for my beloved for taking this message. I embrace each one of you with all the love in my heart and soul. I am your eternal friend in the love of God. I am Care.
