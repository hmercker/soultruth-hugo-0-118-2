Dallas, OR, USA

Faith received by Al Fike

May God's great blessings befall each of you that your souls may open like a flower to the sun, His Love pouring in with the beauty of His grace all about you, the peace that passes all understanding with you.

I am Faith and I wish to assure you that no matter where you are in the world and no matter how you pray or make efforts to help bless that beautiful structure of which there is light, that your prayers will be heard and the blessings will be given, and those who are blind see it and feel it will not obstruct the way of these blessings. God's Will indeed will be done in this place. Whether you may in your physical body enter therein, know that on many occasions you have come to pray there in your spirit bodies and that there is a great effort made by those of you who are in alignment with God's Love and truth, making prayers, eliciting God's blessings upon this place. They cannot stop you from this. They cannot hold back the light and their fears will not obstruct the efforts of God's intentions upon this place. So it will be evermore. God owns this beautiful sanctuary. He has put His touch upon it so it is His just as any sacred place in the world belongs to God for God will insure that it is upheld in light and that blessings may flow.

The idea of a church, hallowed ground, is often a projection of mental desires and ambitions and which has been said hallowed ground can be many different places. God's blessings may flow and gifts may be given in healing and love and light, upliftment of many different kinds, variations of God's blessings.

May you continue to pray for this place. Though you have been restricted so that you may not enter this place in your physical body, remember that the physical part of you is merely one aspect of your being and there are many other aspects, layers, of your being that can be utilized by God in service and love.

Be at peace, beloved souls, be at peace. I am Faith and I love you, beloveds. I love that you persist and you continue to uphold the guidance given, you continue to pray for this beautiful place in the world. Know that I love you and I am with you, beloved souls.
