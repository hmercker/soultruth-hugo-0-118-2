# How Does God Love Thee? 

December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2022

Nashville, Tenn, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



I am here your sister in Christ. I am Elizabeth Barrett Browning.<sup>1</sup> I want you to know that it was me in the book<sup>2</sup> that you are reading by the most wonderful soul, Robert James Lees and his Aphraar. I could not help but come through my brother here and let him know it was me. And I am glad that you took the time to confirm what he received. 

I have been in spirit a good number of years and as you may know, I was actively involved in social issues, particularly slavery and its abolition, but also the ascendancy of women’s rights. I dabbled in spiritualism which gave me clarity in my writings, most especially those that touched on God and His grace and the world to come. 

I am aware that most readers are familiar with my often-quoted words: *“How do I love thee, let me count the ways”*, but I shall tell you as a Celestial spirit what I now wish to say is: *“How does God love thee, you cannot count the ways.”*  My quotation was of the human love and my transformation has led me to extol the wonderment and glories of the Creators love. 

In the place where I live which has not time or limitation in endless now, ever unfolding. I wish to convey if I may, the great peace that comes to a soul in transformation, in redemption. It is not a somnambulant calm, but one filled with light and the radiance from God high above the world. It is true what you have been told that the Celestial kingdom cannot be adequately described to human mind, but I shall tell you the perceptions of your souls, evermore receiving the love of God, can in fact perceive the joy, the freedom, and the brightness of what awaits each one of you in the glorious kingdom of our Heavenly Father. I am deeply grateful for this connection, and I shall come again. May each one of you feel deeply the Essence of the Father changing you in this New Year on earth. In the heavens we shall rejoice on your behalf. God bless you! 

I am your sister in Christ and happy to be your guide if you wish. I am Elizabeth Barrett Browning and I thank you. 

**Note 1** Elizabeth Barrett Browning (née Moulton-Barrett; 6 March 1806 – 29 June 1861) was an English poet of the Victorian era, popular in Britain and the United States during her lifetime.

Born in County Durham, the eldest of 12 children, Elizabeth Barrett wrote poetry from the age of eleven. Her mother's collection of her poems forms one of the largest extant collections of juvenilia by any English writer. At 15, she became ill, suffering intense head and spinal pain for the rest of her life. Later in life, she also developed lung problems, possibly tuberculosis. She took laudanum for the pain from an early age, which is likely to have contributed to her frail health.

In the 1840s, Elizabeth was introduced to literary society through her distant cousin and patron John Kenyon. Her first adult collection of poems was published in 1838, and she wrote prolifically between 1841 and 1844, producing poetry, translation, and prose. She campaigned for the abolition of slavery, and her work helped influence reform in the child labour legislation. Her prolific output made her a rival to Tennyson as a candidate for poet laureate on the death of Wordsworth.
