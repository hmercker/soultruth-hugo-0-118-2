# Refrain from Discussing Politics and Earth Changes

October 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Menifee, C.A. U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike   


I am your teacher, Augustine. I urge you not to engage in the human condition. These ways of politics, religion, education, the structure of your cultures and your countries, they are dying, my friends, and they shall die a slow and painful death. For in the new world that is coming, such things will not be relevant, 
even though within your minds there is such a fixed perception and awareness of how human structures are created and sustained. Yet you have been asked to refrain from the engagement with such things, although each of your lives is ensnared in these conditions to some degree. 

Yet the more you are engaged and committed to these conditions and these ways of life, the more difficult it will be for you to transition from the present structures and way to that which is coming. I would urge you to practice abstinence from these thoughts, perceptions and judgements. Rather, to be free in God's Love, trusting in God's way and God's plan. 

Is this not more exciting than any information or conditions that are part of the material world at this time? Does this not intrigue you and bring you to more questions and prayerful recitations to your Heavenly Father? For to know the Will of God is to be in harmony with God's Will, is it not? Be in harmony with God's laws, to be with God in His desire to bring harmony to your world, to work with humanity to bring that which is of love, that which is not of the human condition, but in alignment with the creation.

May God bless you, my friends, and we will carry on with our conversations as we proceed today and tomorrow. God bless
