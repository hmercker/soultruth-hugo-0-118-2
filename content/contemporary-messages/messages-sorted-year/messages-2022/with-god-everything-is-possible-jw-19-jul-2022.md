My dear ones I am your brother in Christ, Yogananda. I come with the many tonight for this blessing and to assure you protection is yours. For The Creator has each one of you in His arms protecting you from harm during these tumultuous times. Times when it feels to you as if it is not possible to roll back the tide of darkness and the immense changes that seem to overwhelm the planet. But in fact, the opposite is the truth. What is impossible is quite possible. And let me say it is impossible not to change the world. Because you have changed your hearts, God has touched your souls and changed each one that you may become a force for truth, that you have such faith to overcome all fear. That your trust ever grows in your most loving Creator. 

When you reside in Holy Communion with God, everything is possible. Have hope of being conscious, have faith, and walk in love. Take time to pray and be at one with your Creator. Before you even roll out of bed if you can be mindful of this you will begin your day in the love of God, in gratitude for every gift, for every blessing. This will not cost you any money, but it will cost you some time. And this time you make to connect with God is precious time. A time of transformation, a time of soul awakening, a time of Joy!
  
Rejoice in your brothers and sisters, in this Holy communion, in this blessed community, that reaches far and wide around the world and is connected on the bridge of Godâ€™s love to the Celestial kingdom. Take heart. Rest in the love of God. 
 
I step back now and thank my brother for taking this message. And I pray for a blessing for each one of you in the Holy Love of God. I am Yogananda.
