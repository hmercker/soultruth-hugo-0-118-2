May the great gift of God's Love be with you, my beloved friends. I am Andrew. I come once again to join you in prayer, to be in this Light as given by God to each one of us as God brings us together in the unified lights of His Hand upon us. His Blessings upon our souls continues to infill and transform us. So we come together from all parts of the world, acknowledging that we are brothers and sisters, children of God. The gift of His Grace, His Touch, may indeed uplift, may indeed increase the light around us and within us, that all that is of God's doing and Will and blessings be ours today, beloved souls.

You are strong. You have made the choice to be together in prayer because of the light within your souls and your acceptance of the desire of your soul to be in this light, to be with God, and to be together with God. You are strong because you have chosen light. You put aside all your daily concerns, all the pulls of the world, to bring you in directions that are not in alignment with this effort. Instead, you have chosen to be together in light, to walk in light, to be open to God's Touch upon you. So God's Touch comes, beloved souls, and so the transformation of your souls continues and will bring to you the awakenings, the insights, the joy and experience of being close to God.
As you continue to experience these blessings and the power of His Touch upon you intensifies, as you are consistent with your efforts and acknowledge the deep desire of your souls, you also become a light, a channel for others. Those whom you love, those who are connected to you in your life are benefiting by your prayers, by your light, and by your commitment and insistence of the truth that is God's Love for you and for all.

May you continue to bring that message forward, beloved souls, continue to bring the truth. Not only in words but by your countenance, your light, your love, your expression in the world, your beautiful soul shining forth, being a beacon of light in the world, bringing the message of love for all you meet. The world is changed by those who carry the light. The world will be changed as those who carry the light continue to be changed and uplifted and transformed by the great gift of God's Love. 

Can you not feel the change within you, beloved souls? Do you not acknowledge that you are different, that you carry a truth within you and express this truth in your life. Unless you are different from many, the message that you carry comes with the light within. The beauty of your soul is signaling all souls around you that the grace of God lives within you and is available to all who desire it, my beloved friends.

It is a great work that you carry with you. The truth resounds with your being and presence. The love flows around you and through you. The light penetrates the darkness as you continue to grow on light, so this penetration grows as well, and you bring relief to those who are suffering. You bring light to those who are surrounded by darkness. You bring peace to those who are troubled and comfort to those who are distressed, and in many cases, you are not aware of it,  my beloved and beautiful friends, the work that you carry forward as Godâ€™s emissaries of light and love. Yet indeed, you walk with the light, you are the light, and shall be a greater light with each breath and footfall in prayer. You bring the light.

Indeed, the work continues.  Each of you will be called in your own way to bring the light forward in the world. Each of you has a purpose and destiny to bring this truth to the world. May you find the ways, the plan, the flow, and the unfolding of your purpose, your beautiful being, resplendent in gifts and capacities that continue to grow in love. God needs each of you, beloved souls. God needs all who are willing to step forward and light, to be a light, to bring truth and love to the world.

May His blessings of Love continue to pour into your soul and enfold you in Light. May His grace clear away all barriers and difficulties in your life. With this grace, healing of your bodies and spirit, healing of your soul and your mind, awakening of all that is you and all that God created and means for you to be and be expressed in all its beauty, all its wonderment. You are loved, beloved souls. All of humanity is loved. 

May you know and feel this love, be uplifted by this love.  May all the wisdom and truth that comes with the inflowing of this love into your souls awaken you, every part of you, and bring great harmony to you, beloved souls. May God bless you upon the journey towards at-onement with the Creator. You are loved and you are blessed. God bless you. I am Andrew, and I love you. God bless you, beloved souls.
