# Distribution of Blessings

October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Rock Hill, SC

Elijah received by Elizabeth Mack

I am your brother, Elijah. I and many others come to pray with you, for your prayers are strong and they reach God, God’s Soul. And as God’s Soul is touched by your prayers, He sends His blessings and I bring some of those blessings to you in answer to your individual prayers. There are many, many Celestial Angels who come also, who bless you all; each individually and together, we bring you blessings. For as you say, the Father’s Love is great, and we are blessed to be here with you, to bring these blessings to you.

My children, you are greatly loved this day and all days. You are the true children of the Creator, of our Heavenly Father. That in itself is a blessing, one of many. We thank you for coming and coming together, enjoining your souls in this Love. Feel the Love coming to you now. It is mighty and it powerfully flows into your souls. Let it shine through you, children, let it shine through you to the world. The world is in great need and you. You have come. You have stepped up. You are the ones who will touch others and help in the transformation of this world. Bring your love forward. Let it shine brightly for all to enjoy. Thank you for letting me speak. We are with you and will be with you always.
