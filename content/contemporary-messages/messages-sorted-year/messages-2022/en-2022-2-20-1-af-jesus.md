# Release your Cares to God

February 20<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Jesus. I come to pray with you that you may have more clarity within your vision and understanding of truth, that your souls may awaken to all that God has to give to you, each of you, for there is so much that can be given to a soul that is open and willing to receive. That openness comes with the yearning and desire within. The truth comes with a soul receptive, desiring to be in alignment with God. Awakening comes with the great power of His Love transforming your soul. But that awakening is veiled unless you allow all that is of the soul to rise up into your conscious self and cause the alignment, the blossoming of truth within you through all avenues and expressions of your truth self and your being.

You cannot come to these prayers and ask for truth and yet turn away from truth when it is given. Yet, this is such a human condition and expression that within the mind there is an idea that is set, an idea that accepts certain things and rejects other things even though all may be of truth. This winnowing out of those things that are difficult to accept and to perceive stunts the growth of the soul and the individual as they turn toward light and live light in all its manifestations.

With love, acceptance comes. With trust and faith, acceptance comes. So, the doors are opened fully and the light shines in intensely. But it is your choice and your willingness to be receptive to what God has to give to you that determines the progress that you make and that which is true to reside within all of you and express fully through you.

But indeed, the life on this world of yours is flawed. There are many blind spots and inability to accept certain truths, to absorb and reflect the true reality of God in oneâ€™s life. But as you strengthen in love, so you will find that these resistances will decrease and eventually fall away. In this, the strength that is required, the desire that is needed, the receptivity that must come within the mind all conspire to bring greater light into you, beloved souls. God does not reject you for your rejection of His Truth. Rather, God waits to patiently for you to come to that place of acceptance. His Love does not diminish. His Light and tender care for you does not diminish. But as you are stronger in light, clearer in truth, more in alignment with love, so you become the pure and beautiful light that you are meant to be. As you grow in this way, as the impediments fall from you, encrustations of your soul are burnt away by love, and you come to recognize those parts of yourself that are not of love, so you find liberation and joy as these things are released, as you venture forward in greater light.

My beloved and beautiful friends, be strong in light. Be strong in light. Choose light in all things. Choose love to be expressed in all things. Even though you are challenged, even though you find that certain conditions and behaviours of others bring to you pain and judgment and hurt, be in the light, beloveds. Each of these challenges are tests of the soul. As you become awakened by the true power and glory of your own soul, so you will see the truth and accept the truth. In this, greater love will flow. Love is the healing agent that will nullify those conditions that you see around you, amongst your children and loved ones, amongst humanity.

God pours His Love upon you at this moment and through you to your loved ones. Open yourself. Clear your minds of those concerns and open yourself fully to the great inflowing of His Love flowing into your soul, awakening your true selves, reflecting into all aspects of your being. This beloved and beautiful gift from God is salvation, healing, peace for you and for all humanity. May you be blessed, beloved souls, blessed, uplifted. Peace be upon you. Love shines into you and through you, beloveds. We are together in this light, beloveds. You are loved. God bless you. I am your brother and friend. We walk together. I am Jesus. God bless you.
