I am Goldie. Make sure you have ice cream in your gathering for I hear that that makes people happy. In all seriousness, the ice cream of God is His Love. As long as you love and you express love, then whatever you do will be a success. Wherever you are will be a delight. Know that you are guided and that God continues with His hands upon you, keeping you in the light, guiding you along the path,. And so it shall be forever, my beloved friends, so it shall be forever. I love you. Though I've never tasted ice cream, I think it is a lovely thing. I love you too, God bless you.
