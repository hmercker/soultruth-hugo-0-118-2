Jesus received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved friends. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I’ve come today to encourage you and uplift you. I come today to state that a new life is growing within you, the life of the Father’s Essence. His Love is growing and awakening you, bringing to you all that is new, all that is a part of this newness, this transformation that must come to each of you. Allow yourselves to be open and receptive. Put aside your worries and cares, my beloved brothers and sisters. Put aside all that which is not of love, all that which is not of God, for these moments together are precious and Holy. We are together in the Light of His Love. We are all brothers and sisters in this truth. We are bonded, united in this for all eternity.

As you continue to release all conditions that are not of love, not of the harmony of God’s Love, then your bond will strengthen, your gifts will awaken, your consciousness will grow. In this we are becoming more united, more in harmony and alignment with one another. In this you will find your way towards spectacular light, growth, experiences of the spiritual, of the soul unfolding and unfolding like a many petalled flower, each petal bringing a new insight, new understanding, new truth. The magnificent flower that is your soul is responding to the Light and Love of God. You will come to the consciousness, the conscious realisation that you are within this higher consciousness, this consciousness of God and be in harmony with all that is of God and come to know in time all of God’s Creation, the wonderment of God’s universe. All of these things come with one gift, the touch of God’s Hand upon your soul, His Holy Spirit conveying the great Essence that is of His Soul coming to your soul.

My beloved friends, we are unified. We continue to long together, to pray together and to be together in this light. So the work continues, the unfolding manifests. The beautiful awakening of your soul is coming, creeping forward inch by inch, breath by breath until some day soon you will truly know the rewards of your prayers and efforts, how you diligently try to slough off all conditions that are not in harmony with God, how you continue to see and monitor yourself as you are so that you may recognise those areas that are in need of love or in need of healing and reconciliation with God. You open the doors to us and to many others so that we may all be together in this glorious light, this glorious truth, this service of love for humanity. We are brothers and sisters truly and shall be ever more, my beloveds, my beloveds. We are embraced by God and so we shall be His instruments, His channels, His children within the universe of His creation. Beloved souls, know that I love you, that I am with you and we will continue to work together towards the fulfillment of His plan for the salvation of humanity. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you.
