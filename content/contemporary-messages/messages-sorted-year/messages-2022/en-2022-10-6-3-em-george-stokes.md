October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2022

One Nation Circle of Light, Rock Hill, SC, USA

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am one with the Father and I live in the Celestial Heavens. I am George. You know me as George Stokes while I lived on the Earth. I am here to help you in this transition of your souls, created by God and being reborn in the Light and Love of the Heavenly Father. I will be with you, all of you, as a sponsor if you will, of this Divine Love prayer group. I am here to help you establish unity among you such that you will feel each other, know each other essentially, in your souls, and be able to communicate with each other without the wires.

I am your host’s friend and she will be ever attentive to your spiritual needs on these Zoom sessions now and in the immediate future. For my children, you have been blessed. This day, you have been blessed mightily. You are becoming, and I emphasize “becoming,” one with the Father, the Creator of this universe. You shall one day be truly at-one when you enter the Celestial Heavens, and that day will come. I will promise you that. For I, as lowly of a person as I was, am now an inhabitant of these heavens where the love reigns supreme. Our most gracious Father has prepared rooms, homes for each of you as He has for all of us who live here. We are, you are greatly blessed among mankind, and you will see soon the effects of these blessings upon your lives and upon the lives of your loved ones and family members and those with whom you pray.

Continue, continue in your prayers. Continue to strongly pray. This is the most important prayer request one can make, and I thank the brother for this request, for he knows how vital, essential, prayer is, not only to humankind but to the universe, the multiverse. This love is the lifeblood, as humans would say, of this universe. So, pray, my dear children, consistently pray for more of this Divine Love, and let it soak into your souls, transforming them into beautiful, exquisite Divine angels. I will stop now but I will be with you as you pray. I am George. I love you all dearly, with the Love that the Father has given to me and now gives to you.
