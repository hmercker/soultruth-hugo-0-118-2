Beloved souls, I am Andrew. The world will be uplifted in love. This is the destiny of your world for God has a plan to awaken all of humanity and to bring love more fully into your world. Despite all the heartaches and pains, challenges, and disappointments that come in your life and your relationships with others, God’s plan is to heal all His children. God’s plan is to uplift each and every soul upon your world. God’s plan is to change the tides of darkness into light.

I urge each of you to pray for this transformation of the world for it is in the power of prayer and your own examples of love manifesting in your lives that you will find solace and peace and comfort for all the world continues to act in accordance to the Law of Free Will. So, within that reality many continue to make choices that are not in harmony with love. As you continue to grow in love and see through the eyes of love, it is difficult to see and to acknowledge the choices that many are making that are close to you, your loved ones, your friends, your countries, your leaders, all of these individuals who are transparent to your eyes, bringing anguish to the soul as you see how the choices of humanity continue to bring greater pain and disharmony to the world.

This is why it is so important for you to be uplifted, my beloved brothers and sisters, to go beyond this human condition and to cultivate within your minds and souls and lives a life that is filled with light and love. For if no one upholds the truth, if no one strives for something higher and more in alignment with God, if all are lost to the darkness of the human condition and suffer from the multitudes of choices and actions that are so inherent in the patterns and conditions of humanity, then the world will continue to be in darkness.

God is igniting a spark within many souls to bring them to deeper understanding, to greater love. He is making great effort with each one of you so that you may go beyond these conditions. Even when your loved ones suffer, you may feel love and say a prayer and be a channel of light for that individual so that they may come to see the way forward toward light, that they may begin to choose something other than that which is not of light.

I know that you often do not see the results and are not ratified by overt actions and blessings of God toward another, those you pray for and those you act in love toward. But I tell you that human condition and the material world does not manifest these conditions easily or readily. But these conditions are manifest on a deeper plane and level. The soul continues to communicate with God and with one another.

So, as you continue to develop your soul perceptions, you will begin to see that there is an effect, there is a result, and a blessing that comes through your efforts and prayers. In time, as God continues to pour His Love and blessings upon your world, these manifestations will become more material in nature, more readily recognized, not only by you but by all. But there is yet some time to come before this is realized. In the meantime, you must exercise your faith, must walk in the Love of God, and bring to you as much joy and light as you can. For if you suffer along with others, if you join them in this condition, and I know it is easy to do so because you too have within you areas that are suffering, places within you that are not of joy and love, so you commiserate with your brothers and sisters.

But as we uphold you, as God blesses you, as you continue to pray together, are you not making an effort to be upheld in love to reject this condition that has been with humanity since the beginning and now has the possibility of being transformed and healed by the Hand of God and by those who wish and are willing and capable to be His instruments in the world? I know it takes some detachment, a willingness to not commiserate but to see life from a different perspective, to understand that the challenges of life can be transformed into great blessings.

Though you see your loved ones suffering so, in some respect, they are growing and strengthening and will in time change and walk toward the light in a greater capacity than what is their expression at this time. I urge you to release your pain, to release all those things that concern you, and to place them at the feet of God and say, *“My dear and beloved Father, I give this to you so that I might unburden myself and walk in light and that you through your wisdom and power and glory of your Love and Light may bring the transformation and healing that is needed for greater harmony with my loved ones, with the world, and with myself.”*

It is a declaration that is needed, my beloved and beautiful friends, a declaration of love. It is not that you turn your back to the suffering or wish to blind yourself from all that you see but rather, to see it from a higher place, a place of the soul perceiving life from that more expansive perception and perspective, seeing that though there is suffering, there is also light and there is also a great opportunity for each and every soul to grow in light.

Your responsibility, beloved souls, is to pray for those who you know are suffering, to exercise your faith and say with my prayers, for I know that God listens to my prayers, I will help my Beloved Father to bring the healing, the change, the harmony that is required so that my loved ones may have greater joy and greater harmony for I choose to live in harmony and love. I choose this. I walk in this light and will continue to do so all the days of my life and forever more as I desire and focus upon that journey toward at-onement with God.

As you release the pain, you will be used as powerful instruments. But as you carry the pain or even ignore the pain, you diminish the possibility of being the magnificent instruments that you can be. The mind carries this pain. The mind diminishes the light. The mind is not in alignment with God and the Laws of Love, the Laws of Creation. Your challenge is to be aware of all the many aspects of your life, living in concert with God’s Truth and Love, to acknowledge this, to express the gratitude and joy and awareness and wisdom that comes as your soul awakens in love and you release the burdens and pain.

Though you see much, may your eyes also see and express the power of love in your life. It is what has been given by so many to you, the angels who minister to you, the Hand of God that touches you day-in-and-day-out, the efforts you have made to your own release and healing and harmony. These great forces within your life are leading you toward greater joy, greater light, greater truth, and greater harmony. Acknowledge this with every breath. Acknowledge your true selves, the light within your soul, and all that can manifest through this light, through the capacities and blessings and gifts of the soul. God wishes to use you in this way. God opens many doors for you to do so. Allow yourselves the lightness of being unburdened and enjoy, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. May you beseech God to continue to transform this world and bring the light and harmony that is needed, that love may be the currency, that you may be the instruments of light.

God bless you, my friends, beautiful friends. I am Andrew and my love for you, my love for you is great. God bless you, my friends. May God embrace you deeply and fully, uplift you, and heal you. Joy, beloved joy, all around, all through you, flowing from you, beloveds. God bless you.
