There is time, beloved daughter, time to do all that you desire to do to make this place a sanctuary of Light. Be sure to balance the material with the spiritual. Be at peace and when you do those things that are required in the material respect, do so with love and be at peace. Allow the flow of God's Will through you and all will be done readily and easily and with peace. There is time. God will allow for all things necessary to be provided and to be in place in time for that time where the world will need you and need this refuge.

May His Love continue to awaken your soul, all of you. Seek out that gift and allow it to flow into you. You must desire this with all of your heart and soul. Desire the gift that God has to give to your soul and be at peace for all things with God are nurturing and in harmony and balance. So you must find this with each day, each of you find your way in the Light. Be in balance with all of things of God, His creation, this world,, and let the love flow readily, beautifully.

Each of you are charged with many material tasks and responsibilities. It is important that you take time for God above all else for when you are in harmony and in alignment with God so all that which is of the material will fall into place. What is required will be given and there will be no difficulty and arduous insistent tasks that draw you from God. Instead, there is joy and there is the way and means to accomplish all that is required. Be at peace, beloveds, and know that God is caring for you and caring for all of your needs in harmony with His laws.

Beloved souls, you are truly loved and you shall truly find your way and know God's plan realized, expressed and applied to each day.Â I love you. I am Mylora and I love you. God bless you.
