It is I Francis, once from Assisi now an inhabitant of God’s Celestial Heavens. I come to be in this prayer circle, this place of refuge where there is sanctuary from the world. Each of you in a sense is a spiritual refuge. And though you may not have suffered the deprivations of those fleeing wars, starvation, homelessness,  in your souls you all have sought a place where you could touch on the grace of God and be touched by God’s love. Therefore, whatever your physical circumstance or your place of habitation on earth, you are now children on the path of God’s love, a family Divine. 
   
As you come together in prayer, in trust, and in faith, knowing that the love of God will enter your soul, I encourage you to bring the sanctuary of your souls to those who come to you whatever kind of refugee they may be. All need nourishment whether it be temporal or spiritual. All the children of the world need love, whatever their age, whatever their culture, whatever their tribe. As the drum beats, calling out for love, the song aspires to reach heaven, and to lift every soul into grace and this At-One-Ment with our Glorious Creator Whose love knows no bounds and embraces all who come with open hearts. 
  
I call you to service in a world so bereft of truth, so in need of light. This material world is but a reflection of the spirit world just as your souls made in the image of the Creator have the great possibility of going from God’s reflection to being transformed in love into the very essence, the very substance of their Creator. This is God’s wish for His children and you who have answered the call are so very blessed. 
  
As Moses pointed out,<sup>1</sup> your material needs are beyond what any one of us would have considered or imagined or even envisioned. But those of us in the Celestial realms, our vision for you is transformation to Divinity from the mortal to immortal, from the human to the Divine Angel. If you persist in prayer you cannot miss. It is only a matter of time and then even that will disappear in the effulgence and glory of the love of God. From all of us here I bid you deep blessings of love. I am your brother in Christ. I am Francis. Go in Peace, May God bless you!
