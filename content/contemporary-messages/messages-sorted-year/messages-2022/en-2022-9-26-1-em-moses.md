# The Divine Love is the Greatest of All Laws

September 26<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Rock Hill, SC

Moses received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here; I am Moses. I too, come to wish you a Happy Rosh Hashanah. My brother and I (Israel ben Eliezer/Ba’al Shem Tov) we share the same tradition and now we share the same love given to us by our Father. The laws that I brought, I brought for my people to change the ways in which they ought to live. Jesus brought the highest law and when I received this love, this Divine Love, my soul was transformed. My people must know the Truth. They must know that the Love Divine is the greatest law and supersedes those laws which God gave to me.

I ask you children, children, true children of God, do not hesitate, do not question, but set forth on your own paths sharing this law with all whom you come into contact. For we have a great mission upon this Earth. We have great love within our souls, and I ask you to trust, trust in this love, trust that God is with you, behind you, in front of you, that God the Creator of the universe, is with you.

I love you my dear, true children of the Father. Many of us are with you this evening and many of us will travel with you along your path as this Earth transforms into Divinity. We love you. We love you so much and we will protect you. The Hand of God is upon you, the Hand of God and the Love of God is within you. I love you. I am Moses and I thank you.
