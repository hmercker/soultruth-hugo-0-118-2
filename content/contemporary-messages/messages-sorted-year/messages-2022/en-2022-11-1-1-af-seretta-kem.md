Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, my beloved friends. I am Seretta Kem. Yes, great changes are all about you. All within the purview of your lives and the life of this planet in which you inhabit, dynamic changes, subtle changes, all-powerful in their effects upon your world. They are seen clearly by us in the world of spirit, yet often, because of your attachment to the material conditions, these changes are not so readily perceived. Yet, you see signs and manifestations of such as you continue to travel upon this earthly plane of yours.

You are well on your way to attaining the goals that we aspire toward together. Though often, you think of your lives as part of a routine that continues within your life and that things are not so dynamic and aspects of your lives are mired in the mental routines, ideas and perceptions that are common to you. Yet, under this surface perception and experience of life, there are many dynamic aspects and interplays that are happening. It is for you to be aware, to embrace and accept, to adjust and recalibrate as you find the truth of these things as a reality of your consciousness and perception.

The integration of these things is dependent on one very crucial factor. That is your efforts in receiving and praying for the great Love of God, for this blessing is the great dynamo that powers all else. Whether you come to see this as a daily occurrence or not, the power of this Light and Love in your souls is creating a wondrous condition, a dynamic interplay that changes you from the inside, moving ever so slowly but persistently toward your conscious self and your outer life. Have faith in this process and know that you are indeed well-engaged within it. Know that in the flow of God’s Love and Will, many things are made possible, many doors are opened, and much can be realized, many things that could not be realized otherwise.

Indeed, the pace that this takes in your life is quite extraordinary compared to what many others in your world experience and undergo in their own personal spiritual life and development. The fuel of Divine Love is powerful. It is producing results that are extraordinary and deep. It is for you to know this and to come to realize that through the power of God’s Love, through the blessings of His Hand that rests upon you and all of us, through our efforts, those of us in the Celestial Kingdom and others, dynamic change is taking place. The power of these changes will help fuel changes in your world. As you take your place in alignment with God’s Will, as you come to see yourself from the perspective of the soul and your relationship with your Creator, then the clarity comes, the awakening is realized, and the possibilities are seen and acknowledged by you.

 I urge you, my beloved friends, to continue in your daily prayers, and to be faithful to what God has given and guided you toward. Do not let the daily concerns of material life overshadow the greater priority which is attending to your own soul and listening and acting to that which God gives to you. That flow of information which is constant and is readily accessible to your soul perceptions if you step aside from that material place and mindset that often creates a great veil between you and the consciousness of the soul. Willfully and consciously sweep aside this veil, that which obscures the truth and clarity of the soul. Ask God to assist you in this. Take personal responsibility to accomplish this. Make this a priority in your life.

I know that often you cling to the old ways and the old routines and the old perspectives which are rapidly becoming obsolete and indeed challenge this very request that I make of you. But I tell you, my friends, once you have stepped beyond this veil, you will know, see, feel and live within the reality of God and within the reality of your own soul in relationship with God. Is this not the ultimate goal, to know your Heavenly Father in such a way, with such deep and profound intimacy, that indeed nothing in your life compares to this relationship founded in Love?

Breath in the Love of God. Walk and live within the Truth of God. Put all else that is not in harmony with this very simple perspective and way of life, put them aside and be in harmony with the great truth that you know and seek to fully integrate into your life. In this way, harmony will ensue. Joy will be constant. You will know the power within you that is your soul enlivened and transformed by God in His blessing of Love. These things come as a result of your efforts and your desire, and none other can take you to this place. We cannot. It is only within your relationship between you and God that this condition and reality may be implemented and true to your own conscious awareness. Be true to your soul, my beloved friends. Be true to that which opens to you, is gifted to you, a road so resplendent in light and truth and love that as your eyes open, the vision before you will astound you and bring to you a deep, humble joy in all that it is.

This, which can and will be seen, is merely the prelude to what is to come. Think of this, beloved souls, that the joy and depth and meaning of these experiences that God has for each of you is merely the beginning of a wondrous journey. In this journey, God will use you to be His instrument in the world. You will have the strength, the power, the wisdom, the perceptions, the love to reach out to your brothers and sisters in the world and inspire them to follow the road that God has laid before all His children. So that they too may know the freedom, the wonderment, the joy that you experience and have come to know.

May God bless you all on this road. May we all journey together in harmony and peace and joyfully so as we walk the road of truth and drink the Nectar of God’s Soul to awaken us, transform us, and bring us all that we require to walk in light and harmony with His Laws of Love. God bless you, my friends. I am Seretta Kem and my love is with you as we walk together. God bless you and keep you in His Love.
