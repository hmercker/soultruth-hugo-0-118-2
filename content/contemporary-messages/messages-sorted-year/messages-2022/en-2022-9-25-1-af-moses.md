Moses received by Al Fike

…and beloved friends, I am Moses. Each time you say a prayer to God to receive His Love, you assert the truth in the world. You contradict those who do not believe or understand and are contrary to God’s Will and God’s laws. You make a statement, a statement that God is Love and God exists, and God wishes to minister upon all His children, bringing His blessings forward.

So, you assert the truth as you continue to walk this path of love. Though there are those who will not listen to your words, nor do they understand your way, your very presence in the world is a statement of the truth. I urge you to continue in your efforts to grow in love and faith, to grow in your soul, establishing an unending relationship with your Creator.

I know of the trials and tribulations of those who try to assert their understanding of truth, for I too went through those trials and tribulations upon Earth. I became a leader amongst my brethren, for I was gifted with insight and inspiration, and I grew in faith in God. I led my peoples forward because I had faith in God’s guidance, though it took many years for me to fulfil my mission to bring my peoples to salvation. Not the salvation of which we speak of today, but salvation of my peoples as a body existing in the world. With any belief, or movement, or religion, it starts very small, a handful of people who believe and understand the direction in which they must go.

In the case of all of you, it is establishing your relationship with God and in receiving the great Gift of His Love transforming your soul, so you will come to understand more fully the direction that you must take and the expression that you must have in the world. It comes reflexively with the soul growing in love. It comes because your faith grows, your understanding grows, your capacity to love grows. Though you are small in numbers, is it not a wondrous gift that God makes it possible for you to gather together in this way from around the globe?

How different your world is from my world when I lived upon it, how very different indeed. But the human condition remains the same, the scepticism and the doubt, the fear, the biases and the prejudices, they remain the same. But the approach, because of this particular point in time in human development, must adapt to these conditions and these opportunities. So, God does adapt and God does guide and God does inspire. So each of you may express yourselves in a multiplicity of ways. Each of you may see the world from a very different perspective than in my day, but indeed, the truth remains. Indeed, the very fundamentals of your humanness remain and the challenges are similar.

I urge you to be strong, my friends, to be strong in love, to be strong in faith, to be strong upon this journey that will take you in service to your brothers and sisters, because you are a light. You cannot be anything but a light in this world that is often grey and dark and lost, because humanity has lost its way and continues to insist upon the development of the mind and the human condition so that there is no room for God, no room for joy, no room for true spirituality.

You have carved out a place for yourself where there is room, there is a place for God and there is a place for joy and love, and this marks a new beginning for humanity. Though you see yourselves as small and inconsequential in the world, but in fact, you are not, you are the beginnings. You are the seeds sprouting from the ground. You will become a mighty tree of truth, a great channel of love, each one of you, provided you continue to grow in love, to be the love, and to put aside those earthly things that keep you from God and thwart you from the harmony of God’s laws.

Beloved souls, I come to you with great earnestness and encouragement to continue upon your journeys of truth, to not see this as some trifling matter in your life, something that amuses or entertains or draws you away from the distractions of the earthly plane. But rather make this truth your life. Make this truth a living thing within you, an expression all about you in your life.  For when God has enticed the seed of truth to grow through you, through your soul’s awakening, that seed coming to life, He has great purpose for each of you. He has a plan for each of you.

May you come to realise His plan and to realise your particular purpose and expression of it. For, now is the time to awaken, my friends. Now is time to take that great journey, to lead your brothers and sisters out of the darkness to that place of light. It requires great strength, tenacity, and faith. It requires your love of all, putting aside fear and judgement, adopting joy and love so that you may truly be a light in the world. Follow the way of the Master, our beautiful brother Jesus, who persevered in a time that was far more dangerous than yours, for those who are rejected out of their religion and belief.

You have what you require, my friends. You have the truth at your feet. Your life is not difficult and yet you face many dilemmas. I say put these contradictions and dilemmas to God, for God will give you the solutions. God will help you find your way through the maze of the worldly conditions. He will show you who you truly are and what you are truly capable of. You are His children. God created something magnificent, and beautiful, and powerful. All of these wondrous things are being ignited by the gift of His Love pouring within your soul, bringing life to your soul, bringing transformation to all of you. Have faith in God’s Will, His purpose for you, and you will come to know wondrous things, great joy, great happiness in service, in your own personal awakening and the beauty of your wondrous being.

May God bless you, my friends. I am your brother, an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. I am Moses and I follow the truth and I serve God in truth, as do we all, my friends, as do we all serve God in truth and love and light with the intention of bringing harmony to the world, harmony to our own selves and great light. So be it, my friends, for those who are willing, who are strong enough, who walk with footsteps that are purposeful and guided. God bless you upon this journey. We work together. We are as one in the service of God’s Truth and Love. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.
