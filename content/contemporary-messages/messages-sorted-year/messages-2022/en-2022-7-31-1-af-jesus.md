# Compelling Message to Walk with Him to the Celestial Heavens

July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am your brother, Jesus. I come to be with you today in your prayers and supplications to God, so I join you. For, the most powerful thing you might do for your own spiritual progression is send your hearts to God, your desires, your intentions to your Creator, thereby bringing to yourself a response that will enliven your being and your soul.

As you pray for the gift of His Essence, so it will transform you and awaken you. You use the laws for your benefits, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. Utilize all your knowledge, all that is within you that is of strength and light and love to benefit yourself and benefit those around you. For, the world is in great need of those who are willing to draw light to them and through them for the world. Each of you can do this. None of you are incapable of doing this. For each soul, each individual has the power to bring the blessings of God though them to others, the blessings of God to the world, the blessings of God to themselves. It is done in prayer and prayer is the key, not a prayer done in rote, not a prayer of the mind, but a prayer of the heart, filled with feeling, with desire. As the soul brings forth its true desires, direct these desires to God and you shall be touched accordingly and powerfully in relation to your efforts and the intensity of your desire. This is the law.

For God created a Universe that will feed and grow and uphold His children, a Universe that has many blessings awaiting each individual soul, a Universe that will manifest harmony, given the soul’s intention and actions towards harmonious expressions and thoughts. God created a Universe that allows for many opportunities, many ways in which the individual may be blessed and may grow. This is the law, that all of humanity, every soul is destined to come to the light. It is their purpose and it reflects the development and progression of their soul, which must grow and must be purified.

And for those souls who want to take a step further beyond mere purification of their natural selves, expressing their natural love for the world, for themselves and each other, they may find and come to realize the opening of the soul to God’s great Soul, thereby bringing into themselves the Divine Essence, that which will awaken their souls; the faculties, the abilities, the intentions of the soul. For the soul is made within the image of God and when God infills the soul with His substance, Soul to soul reflects some qualities that are of God that cannot be reflected and expressed in any other way but through the transformation of their souls in love.

You embark upon this journey, beloveds, and in doing so you dedicate yourselves as God’s children, to the truth that they are truly loved, that all are truly loved, and that God’s Love will continue to flow upon you and into you because you have opened that  door. You have awakened to this truth and may you continue to awaken. It is not because you ascribe to any religion or doctrine that is manmade, it is because you ascribe to the doctrine within your heart. For each of you desires this. Each of you is motivated by what is within you. Therefore, your journey to God is that of a personal journey, one that is not made or prescribed by another, but by yourself.

May you come to find the true desires of your soul. May you come to express these desires in its fullness and beauty. For in this, you will find at-one-ment with God and in at-one-ment with God, the entire universe is open to you, the greatest of joy is within you. The most wonderful truths are given and understood as your soul’s faculties awaken and respond to this blessing, to all that God has to give to you, beloveds.

Continue on your journey of the soul, seeking God’s great Soul. Continue in your fellowship and your support of one another. Continue in your prayers for this world and for your loved ones and for all in this world. For prayer is a powerful instrument that will incite the laws of God and bring the blessings forth. Pray often, beloveds, pray earnestly, and pray feeling and knowing the Love of God and your love for God. In this, all will come, all will be yours as God seeks to fulfill your souls’ desires and your prayerful intentions. So the blessings flow. So it comes to be. And so, light will be poured upon your Earth as a result of your prayers.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother, Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom and your friend, always to be with you, beloveds. For we are truly brothers and sisters upon this path. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
