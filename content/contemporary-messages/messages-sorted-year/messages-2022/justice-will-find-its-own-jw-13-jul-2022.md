# Justice will find its own

May the Love of God be upon you all, my dear friends, my brothers and sisters. How can one not be mindful of all the injustice in the world and not wish to respond? I ask you to remember that the sun rises on the evil and the good as the rain falls equally on the just and the unjust, and the Heavenly Father embraces all, loves all. I said while on earth these things and also, judge not lest ye be judged, for those who judge will be judged in equal measure.

So, how does one wishing for social justice, wishing for truth to prevail, live in this world of yours? If you are to be perfect, as the Father is perfect, then love all with His Love â€“ for judgement falls upon each soul in due time. And each one will measure their life, as I said, for those deeds done out of harmony, as well as compensation for all the good, but above all these things, is the Love of God. 

Let your love fall on the just and the unjust, the evil and the good, let your prayer be true, that God may change you from the mortal to the divine angel. It is easy to be troubled so one must persist, and as you come into prayer lean on each other, bless each other, help each other. For where one is blocked another is open, where one is fallen another has risen up. And in the wonderful diversity and uniqueness of each human being there is oneness in the Fathers Love, that we are all one. Stay in your hearts so that your souls may be blessed and let justice will find its own. 
   
I embrace each one, and bless each one, and I thank this one, my reluctant brother. Go in peace, stay in the Love, I am with you. I am your brother and eternal friend, Master of the Celestial Heavens, Jesus.
