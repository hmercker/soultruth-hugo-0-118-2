# Remember the light at the end of the tunnel

It has been a good while since I spoke through my brother here but I come tonight to bring you good cheer and to remind you that I lived in a time of great turbulence through two world wars, the depression, and a childhood of poverty and loss where, fortunately, I discovered that I had gifts. And the encouragement of my dear mother gave me the courage to explore those gifts at an early age. 

I made, as I have said before, a commitment in my heart to lift people up through humor and yet never forgetting my roots and often addressing the darkness of the world, authoritarianism, poverty, and so forth, and as you know, the world responded with open arms. Everyone who saw my work, if not delighted, could at least appreciate my intentions, which were to bring joy and love and truth as I saw it to humankind. Of course, I had my foibles, my indiscretions, my challenges, and yet I never lost sight of the need to see humor and joy and the bright side of life.  

We who are this path of Divine Love will do well to remember the light at the end of the tunnel as they say or as Martin Luther King said, *“keep your eyes on the prize.”* Stay in your prayer that you are lifted-up above all the troubles of the world. All the doom and gloom and darkness so prevalent in the airwaves broadcasting such fear. You my friends, who have this gift in your souls, can lift every soul and shine your light in the love of God and bring a little humor in everyday circumstance. For you know the destination is magnificent and I can tell you as a progressive soul what I have seen in the mansions of the spirit world on my journey has led me to deep faith and deep compassion for all on earth, for every soul is in need. 

Discover your gifts, find your aspirations. And if you feel you don’t have any aspirations, pray, and aspire to have them that your gifts may blossom so that the joy of love in your soul may touch this world. Please don’t forget my brothers, to wiggle your mustaches and my dear sisters to giggle in the love of God. I am your brother and friend on this journey. Charlie Chaplin, May God bless you, May God bless you.
