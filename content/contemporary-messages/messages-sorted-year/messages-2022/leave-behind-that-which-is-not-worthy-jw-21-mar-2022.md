# Leave behind that which is not worthy of your future walk !

It is I Care. I do not wish to disturb the beautiful peace and grace that abounds in this circle of prayer, but I do wish to remind you gently, that you can always leave behind that which is not worthy of your walk into the future.  Those things that were once necessary, even helpful. Those things that are no longer a Divine blessing. You can leave. This may be at times people but quite often it is material things that no longer serve you.
 
As you walk this world and, in any moment, become conscious of God’s love residing in your soul, you will have a protective bubble around you and a glow that a soul can see, or shall I say perceive, and in this way your life becomes a gift in service, in gratitude. So, remain in light, remain in love, and know we are with you in the grace of God and in your walk on the path of Divine Love to the Fountainhead of God’s love in the Celestial kingdom.
    
Be at peace and send your peace to all, your love to those so in need, your light to the darkness, your song to the cacophony and the din. May you lift this world up as God has lifted you.
 
With all my love I step back to join you in the love of God in the sanctuary and sanctity of this circle. I am Care your sister in Christ.
