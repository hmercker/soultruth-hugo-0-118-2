My dear brothers and sisters in the love of God it is I, Yogananda. 

As the world awakens to mortality and the preciousness of life, it brings humility and prayer, a longing for peace, an awareness of the importance of every beating heart. Awareness of immortality brings hope to every soul, above and beyond this world. 

Consciousness of God and the desire to be at one brings transformation, brings healing, and brings a happiness beyond the mortal coil. In this troubled world, on this planet in need of a healing, you may bring the substance of Almighty Godâ€™s Love, Essence, to all. When you walk in grace, in the presence of the Almighty, you become an illumined soul, capable of casting out the darkness, bringing a healing balm to the afflicted. It is a noble thing to bring help to those in need. Some needing just the bare necessities of life and some needing healing - physical, spiritual, emotional, or mental, but so many needing to just be brought into an awareness of the light of immortality, of the world beyond, and most importantly, of the love of God. This my brothers and sisters you may bring to a world so in need. 

May every soul be blessed in the love of God. I am your brother and friend, now and always. I am Yogananda.
