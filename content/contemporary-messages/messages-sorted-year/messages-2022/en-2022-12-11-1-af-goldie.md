# You Have Been Baptized by Rainbow Waters

December 11<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Gibsons, BC, Canada

Goldie received by Al Fike

Each of you has been baptized by the rainbow waters, this curtain of water that glows and reflects the rainbow colors. You have been led by Jesus individually through this curtain and as you passed through you have been refreshed and blessed. You glow with this rainbow, this touch from God. Jesus has blessed each one of you, led you through, and embraced you and acknowledged you. May you feel the upliftment, beloved souls, may you know the freshness, the joy of the soul, acknowledged and loved, blessed by God for each of you are precious to us. Each of you have a purpose and a task in your life that is meant and ordained by God. May you find that purpose, my beloved friends, and know that you are truly blessed upon a path, a path that is so filled with light, so filled with blessings, so resplendent in Love. May you repose in God's garden, feeling the freshness of His touch, the cleansing of His waters, the beauty of His creation.

My beloveds, my friends, we are all God's children and we are all loved. May you know this not only in the depths of your heart and souls but in the conscious way that you may have the revelation and that you may have the reverie of this insight. I love you, my beloved, beloved friends, I love you. I am Goldie and I am with you as we repose together in that garden of God and His Love. God bless you, I love you.
