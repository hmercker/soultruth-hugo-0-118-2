Confucius received by Al Fike

Oh my precious souls, I am Confucius. I embrace each one of you and I see the precious souls that you are and how the trials and tribulations of your earthly life often tax you and make you wonder why all must struggle as they do. But I say to you, beloved souls, that each of you have great blessings in your lives, each of you are uplifted by God. And in time with the power of His blessing of Love upon you, you will find answers to all your dilemmas and struggles. I can only be such, my beloveds, only such that the power of God's Love heals everything. And so you will find as you journey upon this path of Love that its power to heal will be manifest both within you and around you. It will come and sooth the troubled waters and bring peace, upliftment, truth, and wisdom.

Though the conditions of the world may push against you, beloveds, the condition of your own soul which is in the process of being transformed by God's Love will be strong enough to withstand any outside force that may dissuade you from your journey to God. You are chosen and claimed by God because you have chosen God and wish to be claimed. Your choice has been made, your journey set upon the Divine path and so you will find your way, beloveds, beyond the intransigence of this world of yours to that place of peace, simplicity and wisdom, all in the light of Love, Love Divine capturing you in its glorious enfolding presence. Beloveds, we walk together in Love, we are truly His children in Love, and we shall do so for all eternity, beloveds, all eternity. And you will look back upon your struggles and say this was fleeting and inconsequential in the journey that is so expansive and powerful in its scope that these little things only help to make you who you are, shaping your personalities and your gifts and your perceptions.

All is well in God's universe, beloveds, all is well. God bless you. I am Confucius and I am with you all, precious birds of God. Beloveds, I am with you all. God bless you. God bless you.
