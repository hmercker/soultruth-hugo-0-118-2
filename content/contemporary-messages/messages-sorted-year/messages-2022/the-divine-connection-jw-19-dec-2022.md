Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



It is I, Care, your sister, and friend. For those who struggle with feeling the Love of God, for those who struggle with loneliness or lack of self-love, self-worth, direct your prayer to our glorious Creator. Know that you have the company of His celestial angels and the safety of this circle. For a friend in God is an eternal friend and the Love of God is an eternal gift. 

Follow your heart and if it is troubled, allow that trouble to reach up, reach out. If you are in a place where you can speak, talk to God, and ask for what you need. All true prayers are answered when the longing is true, when the aspirations are real, when the heart calls out, God opens the soul. This connection is Divine. Let all else go and allow the Love of God to pour into your soul like a gentle waterfall from heaven above. Let the living waters satisfy your thirst. May the embrace of Godâ€™s Love (interrupted audio) as you let all else go. You are amongst friends and so many who love you. When you have the support of the celestial kingdom, you cannot fail. We will come and lift you every step of the way. 

There are many here who are quite serious. The events of the world so dramatic with the changes occurring. I say this to you, my dear ones. Be serious about your happiness. Sing a joyful noise unto God. Walk in the light of love. Bring the gift of your love and laughter for even a smile changes the atmosphere. 

So lastly, I say, stay in joy. Allow your soul to be open at the drop of a hat. Allow your heart to sing and dance for all is truly well in the love of God. With all my love and blessings, and greetings from all of us here in the celestial heavens, I shall join you in this beautiful prayer. I am your sister in the love of God. I am Care. God bless you.
