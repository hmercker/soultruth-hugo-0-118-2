# We are all Beloved by God 

August 10<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



My dear ones may the Father’s love raise you up that you may lift up the world. Everything in creation is in harmony. All souls possess free will which allows them to perceive the harmony of creation, to perceive the workings of their souls, and even this is simply the natural state of things in harmony. On the path of Divine Love, the path of transformation, there is a transcendency over the material world. Which is not to say that one on earth does not live in it but to say that one’s soul, has been touched by the love of God on the bridge to the Celestial heavens. You are upon this bridge. Every time you open in deep love, in sincere faith, in heartfelt aspiration your soul can be blessed. This is the great gift. It is ultimate because it comes from God. 
   
May you all rest in this inflowing, in this glory, and joy so true happiness may be yours. With all my love and blessings. I step back to join you in this prayer. I am your brother in Christ. I am John the Apostle, sometimes called *“the beloved”* but I tell you we are all beloved by the Father. Go in God’s grace and may peace, peace, peace be upon you.
