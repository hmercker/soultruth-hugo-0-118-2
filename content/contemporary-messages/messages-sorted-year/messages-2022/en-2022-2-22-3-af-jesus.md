# Blessing

February 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2022

Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved Father, bless these thy children in Your Love, eager to serve You and to serve the Truth, to be instruments of Truth, to be channels of Truth and Love and light in the world. May they be blessed as they journey along this path and find their way through the human condition to that of Your Will and Your blessings upon each of these beloved children.

I come to bless you, beloved souls, I am Jesus. I come to uplift you, to bring greater light to you and to bring to you release from the human condition--peace, peace beloveds. Know that you are well cared for, that all the challenges in your life may be uplifted into light, given your desire and faith to have God's blessing upon it.

Beloved souls, I know that this world puts a great burden upon you. I know that there are many challenges. I know that often you feel set adrift in the sea of the human condition. But I say to you, continue your prayers, beloveds, continue your prayers and be in alignment with God. This is the only way that your desires and efforts and endeavors may come to fruition, not through the planning and execution of mindful considerations but through your faith and prayers and guidance. Walk faithfully in the light of God's Love and all will come into place, all will be in harmony, beloved souls. You are truly blessed and shall be blessed; guided and shall be guided; loved and shall be loved. Beloved souls, I am with you, your brother and friend, I am with you. God bless you, beloveds.
