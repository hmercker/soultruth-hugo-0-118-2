May the peace that passes all understanding be with you, beloved souls. Each of you are a point of light upon the Earth, each of you praying, not only for your own soul, but for the souls of humanity. What a powerful effect this has in the darkened world to have the light of God’s Touch invoked upon it. For the power of prayer is such so that which comes from God may flow readily with prayer. That which is within your hearts, that great desire of the soul, will influence and change the world, provided you follow those laws that pertain to prayer, beloved souls.

You are God's instruments. You have come to know a great truth. The truth of God's Love is transformative, powerful, and beautiful. God's Blessings may come freely and powerfully with your desire and your prayers to bring this to reality, bringing the touch, the Hand of God upon this world, beloveds.

You are conduits of light. You invoke many things upon the Earth that are of light. May you continue to grow and draw the light of God within your soul that you may truly be expansive and pure and changed by this gift, this gift of God, that is given to each one of you freely, no matter where you are, who you are, and why you have come. 

This gift is offered freely. May you accept this gift and draw it into your heart and consciousness so that you may grow and expand in love, the Great Love of God, which will transform you, which will bring many blessings to you and through you, beloved souls.
I am Jesus. I come to pray with you. For how many in the world truly know this prayer? How many in the world seek this highest of gifts with all purity and clarity in light? You are truly my brothers and sisters on the world. You are truly blessed, beloveds.

I am Jesus, and I pray with you, beloveds, on this day that commemorates that time that the great inflowing of God’s Love in the souls of the apostles. So it is, and so it shall be for all who wish for this gift to be, beloveds. Open yourselves wide for this gift, and it shall be given. God bless you and keep you in His Love. God bless you.
