God bless you beloveds, you open Portals of Light with your prayers and your intentions. As you gather together, so these Portals of Light are intensified and energized. Those who are here benefit from the blessings of these portals, and many others who are not here but still a part of this great group, gathering of souls with the intention of receiving God’s great gift of Love. All are working towards or have received this gift that is a Portal of Light within their homes, their places of prayer.

And in this gift, the ease of the angels to come to the Earthly plane without having to endure the dark conditions of humanity, humanity which cries out from their pain, their darkness. Utilizing  these Portals of Light allows the angels to come and be with you and pray with you more readily and more often.
