Beloveds, I am Andrew. Our beloved brother, Jesus, comes to bless each one of you and he has been very active with your other circle which has come together and now disbanded. The angels have been busy with many of you over these past few days and weeks, continuing to assist you in your journey and your preparations, your prayers, your awakenings. It is for you to be aware of this, my beloved brothers and sisters, to be aware of the ministrations of the angels upon you. For they are present, but it is for you to know this, to be aware, to be attuned, to embrace their presence and draw them close with your love. 

Beloved souls, there is so much for you to be aware of. There is a whole different reality that is functioning around you and around this Earth that so many are not aware of. Within you, you tend to discredit your perceptions and your feelings to the point where you do not give yourself permission to truly see, to feel, to hear. As you grow in the Father’s Love, so you will come to be aware of these things. For God’s intention for everyone of you is to have your eyes opened, your perceptions clear and bright and of the highest. God continues to protect you as you journey forward. God continues to bless you in so many ways as His Love is available to you at any moment that you ask for its entry, for this gift to flow into you.

How often are you sincerely praying, beloved souls? How often are you attuning yourself to these things and matters of the spirit and your spiritual journey? How often do you allow God into your consciousness? It is indeed your desires and perceptions and choices which open the doors which bring the insights forth into your conscious self. Are you able to release those things within you which are suspicious and doubtful and very attuned to the Earth plane, so that you may lift yourself up, that you may choose for God to uplift you, that you may be in alignment and communion with the angels of the Celestial Heavens? These things are available to you at any time. It is for you to attune yourself, to awaken to these things, to be aware of all that is around you and the many different levels of reality that surrounds you. 

May you come to see and know and feel, to hear the truth, to sense the power of God’s Love flowing into you, to be aware of your angel friends, to move in the flow of God’s Will and God’s Love. These things come to you, beloved souls, provided you are aware and invite and seek for the highest. Seek for God’s Love to continue to flow into your souls. Seek to release those conditions that are not of love. So much comes with your choice, exercising the power, the true power of your free will, putting aside the influences and darkness of the earthly condition and aligning yourself with light. Can you do this, beloved souls, do it in joy; do it in deep desire; do it in concerted and consistent effort? 

Do all that you can do to awaken yourself to the ways of light and truth and love. These ways your soul longs for. In these ways, your mind is continuing to assess and accept and to shift towards, so that you may truly be in the reality of God, the Truth of His Love, the truth of all those aspects and blessings that are in alignment with His Will. They come to you upon your request. As you ask, set your mind to thinking about these things that are of a higher caliber and higher nature. Set your mind to praying and in this, opening yourself to the desires of your soul. Set your thoughts to serving others in love, to walking in the Truth of His Love. In this way, you open the doors, you bring forth the blessings, and you find yourself on the road to true soul awakening and liberation and light. 

May God bless you on that journey, beloved souls. Consider what is offered. Consider how you are given so much. It is for you to accept, to embrace, and to have deep gratitude and joy to what God brings you, what love empowers you, and all that you may do as your gifts open, faculties of your soul awaken, all that you can do in the glory of love, in the glory of God, in the glory of Truth. 

God bless you, my friends, I am Andrew. I come to uplift and I come to tell you that your brother, Jesus, comes close to bless each one of you. Open yourself to his blessings. Open yourself to God’s blessings, and know the joy and freedom that comes in this beautiful time of prayer. God bless you. Andrew loves you all. God bless you.
