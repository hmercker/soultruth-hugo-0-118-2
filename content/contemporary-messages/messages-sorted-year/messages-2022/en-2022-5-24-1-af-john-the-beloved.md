# God whispers to our souls so that he can work through us

May 24<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

John the Beloved received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, I am John. God whispers into your ear the truth. Each of you, within your souls, are listening to the views of God as He whispers and encourages and loves you. This flow of love and wisdom is with you at every moment, and it is for you to listen to hear this news of God's upliftment, encouragement, truth and love.

For long years, the angels of God, we in the Celestial Kingdom, have worked diligently to come close to humanity. For we too listen to God and listen to His guidance. We too have our ears open and know God's voice, though no longer a whisper, but clear and melodious and beautiful. As God speaks to us, as God wishes to speak to all, He continues in His efforts and His desire to communicate with His children. Whether they be low or high, dark or bright, God continues to speak to His children, and many cannot hear.

Even you, who continues to pray and seek for the guidance and open yourselves to that which would bring the understanding, the hearing to your conscious self, continue to struggle and strain to hear the whispers of God. Know that we come close in order to help you hear, that our presence with you helps to awaken your soul’s gifts, and we work diligently to foster this awakening.

Yes, many years we have spent working with humanity, and now it seems that many of you are beginning to wake up to the musings of God, are beginning to hear the truth that God has to give, are opening to the Will of God. This brings resounding joy in the heavens, for it is in the awakening of humanity that all of God's children, whether they be on the Earth plane or in spirit, may hear His voice once more, may know the musings of God.

But this place, this Earthly plane, is an important part of this awakening of humanity, and so you play a crucial role, my friends, a crucial role indeed. As you strain and seek to be awakened, to listen, to hear, to know, to be in the grace of God, so you become God’s emissaries of truth, and the passage between God and your soul is opened and cleared with His gift of Love, that you may know, that you may hear, that you may see, that all manner of gifts may awaken.

This is God's plan and each of you have a part to play. As you continue to seek the awakening from within, so that role that you might play will be integral and important to the awakening of your brothers and sisters. You carry this truth in your heart. You walk with a light in your soul that shines forth like a beacon. You have within you and around you the Grace of God, and as you walk in the world, so what you bring may touch many other souls.

Indeed, like God’s whispers, it is quiet and subtle, and many in their conscious way do not hear or know that they have been touched, but within their souls there is a quickening, an awakening, a sense of hope. For, so many souls are locked away in darkness, their encrustations keep them from God. But you speak to them. You are the emissaries, God's messengers, and may you continue to do so, beloveds, as you walk the Earth, as you reach out to others. May you continue to be strengthened in your awakening, your light, so that someday the voice that you have is no longer a whisper, but powerful and penetrates the consciousness of all.

This is God’s desire that all may hear the resounding call, the bell toll of truth, its simplicity and power accepted and embraced by all so that humanity can indeed free itself from the shackles of untold time, where choices and conditions have been built and reinforced, bringing a deafness to the ears of humanity, bringing darkness to the soul.

Beloveds, become the great resounding force and voice of God working through you. May the clarion call, where God beckons His children to be embraced by His Love, be clear and reverberate through the entire world and into the world of spirit, those dark places.

Humanity will be awakened, my friends. You are being awakened. May you know that you are a part of this awakening, this quickening of your soul and the souls of humanity so that the true change, the shifts of consciousness, and knowing and understanding, of hearing, of seeing, may come to humanity, and that the error may fall away, beloved souls, fall away, that the scales may be peeled from your eyes and the eyes of your brothers and sisters that the true hearing of the soul may be opened, and the true understanding and wisdom of the soul may be nurtured in love.

We walk with you, my friends, in the hope that many may hear the clarion call. We walk with you because we are all a part of God's plan as He beckons us forth to awaken, to awaken all of our brothers and sisters.

Walk in love, beloveds, walk in love. Clear all those barriers from your consciousness. Accept the predominant force of your soul that it may truly be your conscious self expressed in the world as God's channels. So the soul will find its purpose, find its light, find all that is meant to flow through each of you, beloved souls. God touches you deeply. God heals you with Love. God carries you and uplifts you with truth and light.

You are truly blessed, beloveds, and may you be that conduit of blessings for others. May you truly be the light, the love, the truth that is needed in the world. God bless you. God bless you deeply, fulfill your soul in love, transform you beyond the pale image that is of the human qualities, to that fruition and beauty, which is a soul realized in love. You are loved, you are loved, and my love is with you as well. I am John, and I love you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
