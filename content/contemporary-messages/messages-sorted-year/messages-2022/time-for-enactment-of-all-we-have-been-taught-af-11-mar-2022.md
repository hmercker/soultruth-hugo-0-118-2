# Time for Enactment of All We Have Been Taught
March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike   


I am your teacher, Augustine. Those things we have spoken of many years ago to those who have made circles of light, prognostications of the future of humanity, considerations of your instrumentality and who you will be as God’s instruments in the world, visions and guidance and blessings of love have poured upon many of you and now comes the time of the enactment of these visions, of the awakening of love within you in such a way that you may be God’s instruments and walk in the world as such.

The time has come. The time has come and you, my beloved and beautiful souls, those who are new to this truth and those who have known this truth most of their lives, can you not feel within you that sense of purpose, that sense of the deliverance of God to you in your soul awakening all that is and is meant to be. Your gifts open and your understanding will continue to awaken within you. The power of love shall grow to such a great extent that you will be transformed and changed to such a degree that none can deny the goodness, the light, the love that inhabits your being and many will come to understand your words and message and instrumentality upon the world. You have been developed and groomed, educated and blessed to be God’s instruments and shall do so all the days of your life upon this world. For now comes the time, beloveds, now comes the time of the awakening of humanity and the transformation of your world.

Though this may be done in ways and means that are powerful and challenging, yet, God’s will, will be done and the world will fall into place and in alignment with God’s will and God’s truth and God’s laws. This shall be.This shall be.

Do not question the truth you know within your souls. Do not shrink away from the purpose that is within. For now is the time to step forward, not backwards, but forward upon the path of service, upon the way of love, upon all that is meant to be as bringers of light in the world. 
 
You are called by the beloved Master of the Celestial Kingdom. You are called by all the angels who are a part of this kingdom. You are called by the Creator of all who seeks for the healing and upliftment of humanity. May the strength of your soul lead you forth. May the love within be the touchstone that will bring all that you do, alll your endeavours forward in light and harmony and in alignment with God’s will. You are God’s children and you shall be His instruments upon the Earth and join many who will hear this reckoning call, this bell toll that draws humanity towards light. May God bless you, beloveds. I am your teacher, Augustine and I come to affirm the truth and to acknowledge your efforts, your light, your souls. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
