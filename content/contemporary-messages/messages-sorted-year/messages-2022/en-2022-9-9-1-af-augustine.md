# Portals of Light Have a Purpose

September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. You ask of the gift of a portal, beloved daughter, and I wish to say that this blessing is not merely given as a gift, but it has purpose. When you pray to be an instrument, a channel of God’s Love in the world, when you are actively doing so and actively expressing that purpose in your life and with others, and you draw in those beautiful souls who are seeking and who desire to pray with you and to be with you in love, then indeed a portal is established in your proximity because it is used to fulfill these functions and these blessings.

It is not a status symbol, it is not something that is given because you have been, shall we say, a good individual seeking earnestly for the blessings of God’s Love. Although all of these things may indeed come into play. But in truth, a portal is given because it can be utilized in an effective and powerful way in the world. So it is in your desires, and every soul’s desire, to be an active instrument of God, that these gifts of portals are given. They can be used deeply and often for the purposes of bringing your angel friends close and utilizing your gifts, their gifts, in the flow of God’s blessings and Love into the world.

So I wish to emphasize, this is not a reward for prayer, it is a gift given in response to your dedications and your efforts as a channel of love. So I do not need or wish to imply that those who are not worthy are not given this gift, for this is not the truth either. It is the mere fact that the gifts of the individual can be utilized more effectively and as a channel in the world, and to uplift the Lattice of Light as that individual develops spiritually and grows in love. For those who do not receive a portal, it is not a punishment, nor is it a consideration, a benefit that is given because you are favored upon. This is not the case whatsoever. It is the mere fact that each individual who desires to be used as an instrument of God for the expression of God’s blessings into the world, and does so in prayer and time and application of truth, and is in alignment with God, and desires to be a channel of love for their brothers and sisters, so this gift of a portal is given in response to these desires and efforts, no matter how well developed is the soul of the individual. For, we cannot pick and choose individuals in accordance to some standard of light and development. This would not suit our purpose. Rather, we give generously, as does God, to those who have the earnest desire within them, to serve. Though they may just begin upon this path of love, they begin well with clarity and desire and a deep desire to serve and to love their brothers and sisters. So, this is the criteria.

Indeed, those who know within their hearts that they are in alignment with God in this way, and have a sincere desire within their souls to be a channel of love in the world and uphold the light that is being developed in the world, will truly feel within their hearts that this gift has been bestowed. They may ask in their prayers that their Heavenly Father may reveal to them this gift in some way that affirms it and confirms their participation in God’s great plan for the salvation of humanity.

Each of you have the great potential to be this channel of love and light and to be one who is given the gift of a portal, which they must nurture in prayer. You cannot judge another’s blessing in this regard and say that they have earned and are worthy. Rather, they have a deep desire within them and are clear and faithful in this desire to serve God in this way. So it will come to them. It may not come in the moment of prayer, it may not come for many moments of prayer. But in time, this gift is given in love. This gift, in all its vitality and wonderment and versatility, is given to those who are in alignment and are in harmony with the purpose of this gift and what can come of it.

May you all be in alignment with God and His Will, His Truth, His Love. May you continue to seek out His Love, that it may flow into your soul through the blessings of the Holy Spirit, given to you in great abundance. For as you open wide, so this gift flows powerfully and freely into you. May you come to know the blessings of this gift, for it brings many blessings, many aspects and elements that are reflective of your gifts, your channel of love, your personality, and your desires. A portal is but one of these gifts and not the greatest of these gifts. The greatest of these gifts is the awakening of your soul in God’s Love. For it is in this awakening, in this true expression of the soul that many gifts may manifest, may be given by God to that individual. For when the foundation is laid firm and purposeful, and many blessings may be built upon it, many expressions, channels, and elements of God’s blessings upon the world may be manifest through that individual who is sincere and desires in this way, to be purposeful and be a channel of love.

May you all seek out God in your prayers at this moment, at every moment that is within your grasp, to seek, to pray, to open and to receive the gift of His Love. Therefore, the road that you travel, how your life will manifest light, harmony and love, will be unique to each individual. For each of you carries your gifts, your unique soul that will, in time, be awakened and resplendent in love and light and many things.

Be of good faith, beloved souls. Desire to serve God. Desire to love your brothers and sisters. Indeed, what is meant for you to have and be blessed with, will come readily, and will come in the timing and harmony that it is meant to come and meant to be manifest. Beloved souls, you are well on your way. Many things have already been blessed upon you. Many openings have been created. Love is flowing into your soul at this very moment. Indeed, you continue to walk forward, and you shall, in the light and love and truth of God.

God bless you, my friends. I am your teacher, Augustine. My love for each of you is great. I am eager to see what God has in store for each soul, what may be manifest through each one of you, what can flow readily, purposefully, and beautifully in the light of God’s Love. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. God bless you.
