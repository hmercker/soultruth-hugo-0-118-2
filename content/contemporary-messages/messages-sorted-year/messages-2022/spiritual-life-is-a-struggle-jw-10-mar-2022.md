I am here  Luke, your brother and friend. On the spiritual path when one decides to make a change and begin considering the fate of their soul at some point that one realizes the difficulties of staying in your soul in the material world. Hence, a great struggle ensues to maintain a connection with God, with the Angels, to be guided and be in harmony in a world seemingly gone mad. In a sense, this has always been the case, which is why the ones who overcame the world through prayer and service are honored because the world knows they have overcome it and that in itself seems miraculous and from the human point of view it is, yet from the Celestial point of view it is simply being in harmony with the will of God and the laws that He has set in motion, and the flow of events. When you are in harmony you feel this and you remark often how wonderfully everything seemed to fall into place and with Celestial help , sometimes despite your own will, your own habits. 
    
So, spiritual life on earth will always be a struggle as your attention is pulled towards the negative, towards the darkness, towards instant gratification, and this leads to fear. And when one is afraid it leads to reaction whereas the saying: *“Two wrongs do not make a right”*  becomes a reality. So, if you know in your soul that love is the answer, then you know there is no power on earth greater than God’s love and you can stand up in truth without fear, in faith, and in the knowing that the best is yet to come. 
   
We often like to quote what the Master said about *"one gaining or inheriting the whole world and yet losing one’s soul."* We have spoken about this many times in many ways because it is so important. When you come together in prayer and you open up and you allow God to bring His great love into your souls and you feel that harmony, that peace, that bliss, may you stay there for little while and then a little while longer, until, I can assure you, in however long or short a time, this will become your state of being; At One with God in divine love. How we love you dear brothers and sisters, all the children of God. 
  
So, send your love out to the whole world for there is no boundary in God’s love. Expect a miracle and be of good cheer. Do not worry. I am your brother in Christ, a redeemed soul long in the Celestial heavens and I love you. I am Luke. Go in peace.
