Mylora received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Mylora. You have drawn powerful healing energies into your group. Your concerns for your brothers and sisters in the world and all the impediments and difficulties that this material world of yours brings forward that healing may calm the troubled waters, that love may bring comfort and peace, that God's Touch may heal the infirm and those in need. These things come with your prayers for you help to open the door and those portals of light are activated as God's Hand sweeps over the world and brings light to everything.

May you feel the blessing of His Touch, the upliftment. May you know the power of the Holy Spirit to awaken your soul with the Essence of God and that we all walk in this Light, beloveds, a light so powerful, so beautiful that it brings peace and awakenings and transformations to wherever and whatever it touches. So you bring this power and force through your prayers to the earth and God responds in accordance to the intensity and desire that you put forth in your prayers.

We are all uplifted beyond the earthly plane to that place of light and peace. Open your souls, beloveds, to the great inflowing of His Love. So we fulfill God's desire to bless and uplift His children, to bring His Light wherever it may be directed and asked to be placed upon the world into the souls whom you gather in your prayers. Beloveds, feel the deep upliftment, the beautiful light that is present with each of you. Put aside your earthly cares and be with us, communing with God. God bless you, I am Mylora. My love for you is deep and abiding. I embrace you all in love. God bless you, beloved souls, you are loved, you are loved. God bless you.
