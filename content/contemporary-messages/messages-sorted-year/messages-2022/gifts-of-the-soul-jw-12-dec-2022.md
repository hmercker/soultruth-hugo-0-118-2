I am here your brother Francis, once of Assisi now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom and always a disciple of the Master. At this time of year more and more thoughts go to giving, to caring, to honor the birth of the Master, our brother Jesus and his work and his life which was all about service.

I came from a commercial family and so I do understand the somewhat maddening rush of the world and the commercial interests to permeate the air with the acquiring of gifts and material things. I went from that world into a very simple life which did require food for sustenance, clothes, and shelter, and we freely gave, my brothers and I, my sisters and I, whatever we could and often we were supplemented by those who had much. In your world so many have much and so many more have little. To give a material gift to one in need is a great service. It is a blessed thing. As you consider how much anyone needs, imagine if you will, a world where all the material needs of all the souls were provided for. It is important to consider how much is required for each life and this is of course, a variable.
     
The material mind considers material gifts and when prompted by the heart, these can be wonderful blessings. The mind of the soul wishes to give the gifts of the soul. These gifts are more substantial than what you call material gifts. They are a treasure and they come from the Love of God. Even if one has little or none in the material sense, one can acquire a great abundance of this Love Divine. This Love is present in this circle in each soul. So perhaps as we move into the joy of the season each one will remember to give the gift that resides in your soul knowing it is the truest and richest gift one can give and receive. I thank my brother for taking this and I wish to thank you all for coming together in prayer. There are many here and we support you and love you in the love of God. I am your brother and friend Francis. Go in Godâ€™s love and peace.
