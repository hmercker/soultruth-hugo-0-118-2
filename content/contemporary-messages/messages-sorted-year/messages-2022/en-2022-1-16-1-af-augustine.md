# God is Knocking at the Door of Your Soul

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

May the peace that passes all understanding be a mantle upon each one of you, beloved children. I am your teacher Augustine, and I come to encourage you to listen to God and make God the focus of your lives.

Each of you have carried the mantle of those expectations and teachings of your culture and your countries, and have fulfilled as best you can those expectations, and with all things that are of the human creation, that has come at a price. That price often is to carry you away from God rather than closer to God, because when your mind is focused upon the material expectations that this world brings upon you. It is very difficult to set aside these expectations and conditions and be with God in His peace and Love, but each of you, precious and beloved souls, have the desire to do so and often make great effort to do so.

I say to you, the time comes for you to release the burdens and expectations of the material world and walk in the grace and the light of God, to not allow those things that have been imposed upon your mind to make a burden that is hard to carry and difficult to release. Instead, I urge you to listen as God knocks on that door of your soul and God wishes entry therein, so that you and He can have a conscious relationship together where you are truly hearing and knowing His sweet voice and guidance for you, His Love flowing within. For, the power of this gift and blessings will do much to break down the barriers and the burdens of a life lived upon the earthly plane, and indeed God's intention is to remove the barriers from all His children, to bring forth a new day for the worlds.

For Him to do so, He requires His instruments on Earth. He requires those who have faith and walk in the truth of God's Love to release the cloak, the barrier of those old and worn ideas and conditions which have beset everyone upon your world, to be free and awakened and loved, to be true and free of all those things that are not of God. Beloved souls, God beseeches you. He knocks briskly upon this door. He seeks for you to answer Him, to open yourselves to Him. In order to do so, you must put aside the earthly concerns and be with Him within your soul, and then that connection and relationship may be conscious and joyfully so.

The world has nothing to give to you, beloved souls, but God has everything to give to each of His children. Are you willing to release that error within you, those fears, those judgments, those unbridled thoughts that have been so carefully placed within your minds over many years, and truly be in the grace and blessings of God? That all the rest of your days upon this Earth may be days that are blessed, filled with light and that the burdens may be dissolved in joy and truth and love. It is God's invitation to each one of you, beloved souls, and shall remain so for all the days you live upon this Earth and the countless moments in the spirit realms. God's invitation stands and shall not be withdrawn.

May you listen and respond in love, in faith and appreciation of all that God is and all the Love that God has for each of you. Be free of the burdens, beloved souls. You have angels who surround you, eager to assist you in this healing, in this release. Your lives do not need to be so difficult. Once you have simplified your thoughts and focused your desires upon all that which is of God, nothing can harm you nor pull you away. You will know the great upliftment and joy and freedom that will come as you open the doors to God, the doors of your heart, your soul and your mind.

You have been given many blessings, have seen your way through many challenges, and you know that which I speak, for it is the truth. God is with you in all things and shall continue to uphold you as you walk the Path Divine towards at-onement with Him. Be joyful, beloved souls, that you know this truth, that your heart sings with this truth, and your soul is being transformed by this truth. It is a magnificent journey and shall take you to places unimaginable, experiences so deep and profound that it will truly change your perspective and that which you desire.

The soul yearns for God. May you listen to that yearning, and may you listen to God's response as He reaches forth in Love and embraces each one of you, fully ,deeply, healing, uplifting and bringing peace. All this comes with His Love for you. Truly be His children, beloved souls, and we shall walk this path of light together, joyfully so, joyfully so. May God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine, and we all continue to join you in prayer and walk with you in light. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
