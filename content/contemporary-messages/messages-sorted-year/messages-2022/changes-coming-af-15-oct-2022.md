May God's Love infill your souls, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters in the world. I come, I am Jesus, I come to pray with you and to speak to you about the times that are coming, the changes that will be manifest upon your world.

Beloveds, each of you are feeling and sensing the need to change, to be prepared for the coming days that will be challenging. Along with these challenges will come many blessings, many opportunities for spiritual awakening and blessings, and to be a channel of love and truth in the world. For it is within these changes, a world that will be upside down in perception and in the daily lives of all who live upon this earth that you must help bring a sense of order and peace to your brothers and sisters. First, you must bring this to yourselves through your prayers and blessings from God. To be prepared, beloved souls, is most important at this time, to see your world in such a way that you are in harmony with the laws of God's creation and the laws of love. It is not time to procrastinate and to feel distracted or downtrodden by the human condition. It is time to break free from these things and be in harmony with God's Will, to truly within your soul, your mind, your consciousness, to be within that flow, that great river of God's Love and blessings. For now is the time, beloveds, to truly be prepared.

You sense the changes, they are all about you and they will increase in measure and intensity. So you must indeed find your way through the confusion and that which is not of your normal life and be in God's care, the flow of God's Will, the truth of God's Love. In this way, you will find your way through all that which will be disruptive and confusing. How else will your brothers and sisters come to know that there is a plan that God intends for His children to find harmony, peace, and love? And that those things made through the efforts of man are now to be put aside and recalibrated in such a way that there will be harmony, that the intentions of man in their material expression will be changed, will be healed, will be brought to harmony. But this will not be done through the acceptance and acquiescence of human will. It will be done through God's Will and those who are willing to follow God's Will. They will find their way back to harmony, and those who do not and cannot will not find satisfaction or peace or the fulfillment of their desires through the old ways of man since these things will not be relevant to the new ways that are coming, the way of God that will manifest in the world.

I urge you to seek God with fervency and deep desire, to seek the truth of His Love through prayer, to be sensitive and aware of God's Will and God's presence. For it is time that you are readied for that which is coming and to know the grace, fulfillment of God's Touch upon you that you may be His instruments, His channels of love and to bring wisdom to your brothers and sisters. Wisdom that is needed, truth that is needed,  to help your brothers and sisters find their way through a changing world to that world which will be new and refreshing and filled with life in harmony with God's Laws.
 
May God bless you upon that journey, my beautiful brothers and sisters. I am your brother, I am your friend and I come to urge you on upon the path of light and truth and love. We are united in this, beloveds, and so we will grow close and you will know me, each of you will know me in times to come and find the light and love and comfort that I may bring to all of you, and I may point the way to God and His great blessings upon your soul. Beloveds, you are and have been blessed and so this journey will continue. You will find your way, you will know the great blessings of God upon you provided you focus upon this and put great effort toward it. 

It shall come. I promise you, beloveds, it shall come to each of you. You will know the joy and the upliftment of the Father's Hand upon you. Beloveds, I am with you, I love you. God is with you every moment and loves you beyond measure. Seek out the Source of all love, seek out the Source of all wisdom, seek out your own true selves and you will find your way, no matter the tumult and the chaos. You will find your way and you will be safe and guided and at peace. Beloveds, I am with you always, I am with you in love, I am with you in prayer, I am with you when you seek for the highest blessing and the greatest good in your lives. Be at peace, beloveds, and know that God is with you always. I love you, I love you dearly, my beloved brothers and sisters upon the earth, I love you and I am with you. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
