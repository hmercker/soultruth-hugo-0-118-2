Beloved souls, I am Matthew. I come to encourage you upon your path of service, to encourage you to walk in the world as a light, to be a light wherever you may go, to be that channel of love that God so wishes for you to be. Beloved souls, each of you is a light. Each soul here has great possibility of being a channel of light and love. Walk in the world as that light. Be truly in harmony with God’s Will. When you are in alignment with God, when your souls are longing for God’s blessing of Love, when the truth and wonderment of that Love infills you and expands forth through you and from you, then you are truly God’s instruments, His channels of love in the world. In this way, all else will follow, all that you desire as an instrument of God will open and flourish in the Light of His Love, the beauty of the light within your soul. 

You are truly His children. You continue to be awakened, to find your way upon this Path Divine. And along the journey, insights, openings, opportunities, and true understanding come. So I urge you, my beloved friends, to be open to all that God has to give to you and to be open to all that God guides you towards, so that His Will, His Love, His blessings, may flow accordingly.

Beloved souls, truly be His instruments. Truly be that child you are meant to be. Truly walk the path of light and then all shall be given. The bounteous blessings of God will flow abundantly and beautifully. You are loved, beloved souls. Know that you are loved. Feel that love, absorb that love and express that love. In this way, you are an example, truly a channel for God to reach other souls. Be true to yourselves. Be true to the Truth. Truly know love, the power of love, the quality of love that is of God’s Soul, awakening you and transforming you. 

Beloveds, be in alignment with God. Seek that alignment with every breath and all else will follow. You are blessed, beloved souls, you are truly blessed. I am Matthew. My love for you is great. You are truly needed in this world, truly a light. Be at peace and know that God’s Hand is upon you. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.
