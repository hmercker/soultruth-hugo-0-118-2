Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, it is your Professor Salyards, your old friend, one who has a keen interest in your work and efforts together.

As you look back at the beginning of this journey, do you not see how far you have come? Though in your human impatience and ideas of progress, you may think it has taken some time, but indeed it has given you time to contemplate and to consider your steps, one at a time. And so you have come to that place where you will put forth your public face and your public efforts to benefit those who are interested in what you offer and what can be offered to help uplift  humanity.

The structure has been built for this home of love. It is now almost complete. There are finishing touches, things that may need to be done to help this to be a beautiful and appealing place to enter therein. But surely you see that you have created, somewhat effortlessly, something so beautiful and so wonderful. Each of you must feel a sense within your soul that you have accomplished something that is significant and something that will become useful for many in the future. You will be surprised how many will come through the threshold of this beautiful place, some will come to visit with you for awhile, while others will stay and some will carry on further in their travels. It is always the way, my friends, that there are those who are firmly dedicated to the truth that you have to offer and the way in which you embrace them and invite to join in this family of love. While others through the curiosity of their minds will come for a while to investigate  gleaning whatever knowledge and truth they can. Yet, it is within those who truly are seeking from their souls that this place that you create and open to them will be a place of peace, of rest, of strength that will help them to truly understand the yearnings and desires of their souls. The Love of God will flourish here. Your efforts will flourish here. It will become and remain a focus for some of you as you continue to serve God. God will help you to make a beautiful, finished and inviting place; His angels are with you in this regard. You will see yourselves inspired, acting effortlessly to accomplish what needs to be done to complete this work.

Indeed it will evolve, some things will be left behind and other things will move forward and expand, and new things will come. This is the way of such ventures and projects. But what is truly beautiful about these efforts is that they are all inspired, that you are exercising the inspiration that comes to your soul and putting this forward in beautiful ways. And so it will continue to unfold in this way and so you will see that from meager beginnings, humble beginnings, that a mighty effort dedicated to the truth of God will emerge and be strong and be of light. May you continue upon this journey together, my friends, and invite others who are willing to share in the responsibility, the efforts that are required. God will guide them to you. God will insure that your needs are met and that the doors will be open and remain open for the foreseeable future. Blessings to all of you, kudos to all of you who continue to pray for and act upon this invitation, expression of God's Will in your lives.

You look back now and see the progress you have made but in future years you will see far greater progress, far more accomplished, many, many souls touched and truth expressed shining forth through the beautiful efforts and endeavors of your souls eager to serve God and to be in alignment with God's Will. May God bless you thus, my friends, may you awaken in His Love, receiving this gift over and over again until you truly are awakened and truly are in alignment, full alignment with your Heavenly Father. God bless you, my beloved and beautiful friends. We will continue to work together and truly be upon this path that is  of light, that serves to bring light bringers together, awakening together, supporting one another in love, supporting light and truth, and God's Love available to all.

God bless you, my friends, I am Professor Salyards and I walk with you, my true and beautiful friends upon the earth, as do many, many you do not know yet but will come to know--the angels of heaven who have dedicated themselves to these great efforts. Blessings and love to you all, my friends. God bless you, God bless you.
