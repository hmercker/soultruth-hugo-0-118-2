# Spiritual Progression 

March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

My Dear brothers and sisters in the love of God in the Christ consciousness who are awakening to your own soul’s progression, blessings to you. As one awakens the eyes of the soul begin to see a world in sleep one of somnambulant materialism and as the poet once wrote: *“leading lives of quiet desperation”*,<sup>1</sup> not knowing where to turn. Many have been disappointed with whatever faith they may have grown up in; whatever church, or religion. For though the moral codes of all faiths can lift one up in the human condition, in brotherhood and sisterhood, and in care for the earth, it is rare and often in-between the lines of scripture where one finds the call to pray and to ask God to open up your souls as you do. You can see how rare this is in the world, and yet you also see it is a hungry world, the hunger of each soul for love and to connect. 
   
If you could see the progression of souls from spirit, they would appear as in concentric circles spiraling from the deepest depths of darkness up to the fountainhead of God’s love. For progression is the law of the Universe and all will be purified. And those who seek at one meant with their Creator will be transformed as we are in the Celestial heavens. There are also many in the world who seem to be wandering in the desert looking for the living waters and sometimes pausing while only the trappings of spiritual life attract them yet eventually dropping those things which do not benefit them on their walk into the light and love of God, which is your destiny. And so, as you come together for this love, as you come together to pray for the world and its leaders and the hungry and the homeless and the troubled and the transitioning and newborns, we join you. 
 
I wish to give you a final impression. When you are on an airplane high above the earth you trust in the pilot and the plane and laws of nature to carry you to your destination. I say as you rise above this earth plane ever more trust in God, trust in peace, for all things all possible with God. 

 
I thank you for this time and I will join you as many here will in your prayer as we let God bless us all 
 
I am your brother in Christ, your eternal friend, I am Yogananda. God bless you.
