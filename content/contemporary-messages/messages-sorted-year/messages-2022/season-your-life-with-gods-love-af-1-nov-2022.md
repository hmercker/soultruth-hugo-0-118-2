# Season Your Life with God’s Love

Bless you, beloved souls, I am your teacher, Augustine. Everything in your life has its seasons. You’ve heard this phrase from time to time, that indeed, in your spiritual life there are highs and lows, different aspects of your efforts expressed in their own particular way reflecting the condition of your soul and the intention of your mind to serve God. So, these seasons are reflected by your free will choices, the condition of your soul and the trajectory of your soul’s development and awakening. 

There are highs and lows. There are times when you feel in harmony and you know the joy and the reflection of the light of your soul expressed in your life. At other times you are challenged by not only your Earthly conditions but conditions within you that are difficult to reconcile with the truth of God’s Love. Yet, with each shift and change and time in your life, so God presents you a gift, a gift of change when there are challenging times within you, a gift of affirming the truth when there are joyful and expressive times where you are engaged in the world and feel the flow of His Love and Light and blessings through you. 

There are times when life seems somewhat neutral without the dynamic expression of your soul reaching out to others or even reaching within yourself. This is a reflection of the ebb and flow of life in your world and the ebb and flow of your own soulful condition. So, you must be patient when you do not feel the excitement and the sense of being enthralled by God’s deep blessings upon you, awakening you and upholding you.  When these things are present in your life, when your souls rejoice in the Light and Love of God to such a degree that you feel as if you have reached the pinnacle of this condition, this beautiful loving and joyful place. Yet, as everything in your world, there is a peak, there are valleys and there are troughs which you must entertain and walk through in your life. When you’re in that trough, that place of lower conditions, I suggest you become more engaged in prayer in order to be uplifted once more. Though within that trough, that place that is uncomfortable, know that this too is a gift, that God is giving you the opportunity not only to assess your own true spiritual condition, but to also release those conditions that are not truly a part of God and His Truth and Love. 

This process of learning, growing, changing and shifting is part of life’s experience. It is not that God intended for humanity to go through these difficult times and then be upheld in times of light and joy so that you travel up and down through these hills and valleys through your life. Rather, His intention was always that humanity would know the great joy of His Love, the great blessings of His presence and your relationship fulfilled with your soul and His Soul. Humanity has chosen a different road, however. Thus, you experience that choice each and every day, the reality of the human condition as it presses against the reality of the soulful condition that is awakened in God’s Love.

Still, you are upheld by angels and when you pray for the gift of this blessing and the blessing of God’s Touch upon you, are you not lifted up each and every time? Do you not feel a sense of elation and joy and expansion that comes with God’s Touch? This may come at any time whether you are feeling that lowness of the dark conditions of the world or the pinnacle of the light. You must pray and enhance the light and lift yourself out from the darkness. This is your challenge and this is God’s invitation to reach each one of you, to walk in the light always, to contradict the will of man and ascribe to the Will of God which is to be in the light for evermore. 

It is your choice, beloved souls. Yes we understand the incongruity of a life intended to be in light but at times is in darkness. We, too, struggled when we were on the Earth plane, so we understand your struggles. We have great empathy and love for you, my beloved and beautiful students. Yet, you must go through this process of change, the conditions that challenge, the tests that come as you walk through life desiring to be that child of truth, that soul of light and to know the truth and understand it thoroughly so that you may choose accordingly.

My beloved friends, you have been blessed over and over again. You have been uplifted many, many times. And, at times you fall into that trough, but often you are picked up and lifted up by God and His angels. So it shall be for you as you continue your life upon this world. In time, those troughs become shallow and the peaks become great as you continue to grow in the Father’s Love.

May God bless you, my friends, and keep you in the light and uplift you from the darkness. May you open wide to the inflowing of His Love and come to see your own soul for the beauty and wonderment that it is. Be at peace, and know God’s Love as the very anchor of your life. Know the power of your own choice and how you may exert that choice for your own benefit and upliftment. 
 
May God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. My love and care and efforts on your behalf continue because I am a Celestial Angel, a servant of God. I come to minister to you as do many others as you continue in this journey towards greater light and truth and love. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. God bless you.
