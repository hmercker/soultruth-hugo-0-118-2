I come, beloved souls. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and yes, I continue to teach the truth of Divine Love in many places. Many places in the world of spirit and upon the earthly plane. For until that great gate to the Celestial Heavens closes, I shall continue my efforts and my mission to bring the truth of God's Love to all. 

How wonderful it is to have my brothers and sisters here today, who also teach this message, who also share this truth and live this truth in the world. This is the fulfillment of my efforts and my mission, and it is the fulfillment of your soul's desires, beloveds.  To be in the world as an example of truth and love. To be clear of all conditions that are not of love. To teach that which is the truth. To carry the light of truth wherever you may be and whoever you may meet.  In this way you are my disciples, and you continue to serve God in His Desire to have His children redeemed in love. 

Such a simple truth, a simple message. It is exemplified and glorified in your light, beloveds. It is your example, the flow of love through you, the flow of light all around you, that brings the power to this truth, that brings others to understand its true purpose and blessing upon each individual soul.

Allow yourself to be in the flow of God's Love always. Allow His Light to penetrate all of you, infilling you with His Love, transforming you, making all possible, all channels and gifts that you possess, clear and beautiful, in harmony with God. May many be blessed through you, beloved souls, and know that I come to be with you and walk with you as you walk in the world. For we are God's instruments. We carry this light, this truth, as your soul awakens, so you are a powerful instrument for God.

Beloved souls, know that I am with you and my love is with you. My love is with each one and the many who carry the torch of truth in the world. As we pray together and you seek for peace, seeking for the upliftment of humanity, know that it is with the intensity and sincerity of your prayers that there are answers and there are blessings given. Many who are in darkness and pain are uplifted by your prayers, beloveds. Many who seek truth may find truth through the many avenues that you open, the many ways that God uses His instruments.

There is much work to do, beloved souls, so much to nullify the darkness and bring greater light. Beloveds, we are together in this light. We are in this love, this flow of love, all brothers and sisters, all a part of a great family of love. 

God bless you beloveds. I am with you. We carry this truth together. The torch of truth burns bright amongst you. God bless you, my beloveds. God bless you. I am Jesus, and I come to pray with you this day and each day. God bless you.
