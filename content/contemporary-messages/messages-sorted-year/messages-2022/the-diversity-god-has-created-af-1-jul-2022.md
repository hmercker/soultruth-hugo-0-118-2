Beloved friends, I am Orion. The diversity of life and the power of life manifesting in your world is of great interest to us. To see how God has created such diversity, such beauty, such an intricate web of life that it is extraordinary in its complexities and its depths. Yet, many do not honor this and some even fear it, the power of the natural world - as you call it - which is a great tragedy. For when one opens their eyes to what God has created, truly seeing from that deeper part of yourself, you will see that all is created in love, all is meant to be in harmony. 

Yet, because so many of you on the earthly plane struggle with the conditions that humanity has created, that it has blinded so many from this appreciation and vision of God’s Creation. When your souls open to God’s Love and those perceptions heighten and become re-sensitized, then often when you look around you you see the beauty and feel the harmony and power, the wonderment of God’s Creation. Because the soul vision allows you to see beyond those biases and restrictions of the mind, the soul awakened in love, the Divine Love, the great Essence of the One who creates and is all powerful, then the true wonderment of life becomes evident. 

As you awaken, all of these aspects of God’s Creation will come to the fore. A deep sensitivity will grow within you. A powerful and beautiful way of looking at the world will overshadow all that which is not in harmony and in appreciation of life. You will be a changed person, your soul creating powerful avenues of love, of joy, of appreciation, given to you by the Father’s Gift of Love. 

Release all that which is not in harmony with God’s Creation, with God’s Love, and be joyous in what is, what can be, in the ever-growing movement of God’s Creation, this flow towards greater life and greater harmony. 

May God bless you on that journey. I am Orion, and as one who is an observer not from this world, I am awestruck by its beauty. I am in wonderment by what God has created. May you join me in this true appreciation of God’s Creation. God bless you, my friends. God bless this world and all within it. Thank you, thank you. I love you.
