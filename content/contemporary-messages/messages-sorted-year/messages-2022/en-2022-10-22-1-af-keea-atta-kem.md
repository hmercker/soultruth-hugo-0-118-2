Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

You must treat yourselves tenderly, beloved souls, for in this stage of development, you are quite vulnerable. You are like pupae which are developing in order to become the butterfly. At this stage, any number of things can happen to divert this process. So, I urge you to be vigilant in your prayers, to ask for protection, help and guidance so that you might be safe and undergo this transition more easily.

Do not create problems for yourselves, beloved friends. Do not overtax yourselves in regard to your efforts on the material plane. Rather, make your life a spiritual journey, a dedication to God. In this way, you will open the doors to much assistance, so many who would come and be close from our side of life and help you with your dilemmas and your challenges. Be prayerful and be in the light. Do not make yourselves vulnerable to that which is not light.

It is not that you are in great danger but indeed, the conditions in your world continue to darken. The voices of humanity cry out in great need and anger and futility. This message and voice cover the world. So, it takes greater effort for you, beloved souls, to ensure our collaborations, closeness and rapport with you to penetrate these conditions that are continuing to inhibit our efforts. Indeed, there is a great storm in the hearts of humanity, a raging storm that indicates how out of balance and harmony is the human race. You must be vigilant, holding tight to those foundations, underpinnings of truth in your life, holding and grasping to God, keeping yourselves in balance and harmony, upholding the truth.

We thank you for all your efforts and who you are as beautiful, bright, and precious souls. Continue to stand fast, to be of faith, to be strong in love, and strong in the Truth of Godâ€™s Love.

God bless you. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you. God bless you.
