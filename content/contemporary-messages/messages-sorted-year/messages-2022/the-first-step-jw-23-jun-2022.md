# The first step in opening to the Love of God  

June 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2022

Marietta Valley, Wisconsin, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here, your brother in Christ, John the Baptist. I can tell you that the first step in opening to the Love of God is to be humble enough to open your heart in asking. Before I knew of this great gift, my longing was to give up everything and to live in the wilderness. And when I had received and began my mission, I preached renouncing the world, to give up your sins, become baptized and cleanse yourself, which the waters represented.
 
The account in the gospels of the baptism of Jesus and the Holy Spirt descending, is essentially true. For it was through the Holy Spirit of God, that God’s Love descended upon all of us. Yes, I was the forerunner of the Master, and that day was a Pentecost of sorts for those of us present, most especially myself. I began to preach a different gospel, one of being baptized in spirit.
   
It may seem incongruous to equate humility with strength, but spiritual humility and a soul who is opened to receiving God’s Love, receives a powerful gift. This is the power of God’s Love in one’s soul and it humbles one. The Master, who was the humblest of souls and remains so to this day, is also a great and luminous spirit, the highest in the Celestial Kingdom, and the power of God’s Love comes with him wherever he goes. So, as I did, you might want to let go of your attachments to the world and be humble, that you may walk in the Love of God all your days until we welcome you here where the Love of God reigns supreme. May your souls bless all. I am your brother in Christ, John the Baptist. Go in God’s love and peace.
