It is I Clare. My dear kind mice I feel your beautiful hearts. I feel the longings you have for peace, for change, for safety, and for transformation. Allow your hearts to open in this circle of love. Allow this healing in yourselves and for the earth for there are billions sending up prayers. 

When the light shines with a great magnitude those in darkness must step back. Just as you have read that the brightness and atmosphere of higher realms informs those in darkness that they must lighten up to enter and to feel at home. So, send your light send you love with all those on the earth and all of us here to those in darkness, to those whose free will has caused so much suffering and destruction, that they may be touched, and Godâ€™s will may be done on earth as it is in heaven. 
 
Be at peace. May God be praised and may peace prevail. All my love and blessings to you my dear ones. I am Clare. Go in Peace.
