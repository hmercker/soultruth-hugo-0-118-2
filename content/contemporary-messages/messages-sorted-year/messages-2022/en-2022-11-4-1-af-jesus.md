# Blessing for the World

November 4<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Gibsons Healing Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

May the blessings of God’s Love infill your souls, my beloved brothers and sisters. I come, I am Jesus.  I come to pray with you for your own souls and for the souls of all who live upon this world and all the creatures of this world and all that is of God’s Creation. For prayer is a powerful antidote to the conditions that are not in harmony with God’s Creation. As you seek to rise above the human condition, you enter into the reality of God and this is dependent upon the intensity of your prayers and the desires that you put forth to your Heavenly Father. If you seek for the highest, so you shall attain the highest, beloved souls and in doing so, you affirm the reality of God, you walk in the reality of God’s Creation and thereby you become the instrument. The ways and means of God can help to heal the world and bring harmony to all within it.

Beloved souls, seek to know your Heavenly Father. Seek to know the reality of God’s Creation, to see with the eyes of your souls, beloveds, to feel with your heart full of love, to appreciate and acknowledge all that God has created, to be His child who walks upon this Earth in harmony with His Laws of Creation. These are the things that bring you forward in light, that help you to grow within your soul, to help you see with the eyes of your soul, to help you move with the wisdom of your soul within the world.

Beloveds, seek for the highest, seek for the great blessing of God and all else shall come, all blessings shall flow not only to you, beloveds, but through you to many others. The world is in need of many who seek His Love, who seek for the highest, who seek to be instruments of God, lights in the world. Pray for your brothers and sisters. Pray for those who are struggling towards light that they may find their way, that they may be within the great realms of God and come to know His Holy Spirit touching their soul. Though they may not have words or names for this great blessing, may they come to know it within their hearts and feel the upliftment and the elation that comes with this touch from God.

Beloveds, it is for all of you and many more to pray to be instruments of change, of healing and love in the world, for this is how the world may be healed. It is through love, it is through prayer, it is through light. May you be in the Light of God. May you know His Presence often. May the Truth of His Creation be your truth. May the peace that passes all understanding be yours. All these blessings God wishes to give to each of you, and so, it is for you to acknowledge and accept, to be in harmony and in alignment with all that God wishes to give to each of you.

May God bless you on this journey, beloveds. Know that I love you. Know that God loves you. Know the love that you have for one another and for your Creator and all that is created. May this knowledge be your anchor, your truth and your light. God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to pray with you this day and be with you in your desires to uplift the world, uplift humanity and uplift all within the world. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. My prayers join you in these great efforts. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
