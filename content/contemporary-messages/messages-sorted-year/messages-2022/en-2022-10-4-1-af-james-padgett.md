Pacific Coast Soul Awakening Tour, Menifee, CA, USA

James Padgett received by Al Fike

[I am] James Padgett. I was with you as you spoke of things of the Truth of God and the Divine Love, and how you long for the world to know of these Truths. But indeed, in time the world will know, and each of us has been a link in that chain, part of God's plan for the salvation of humanity.

We have done our part, have we not?  Well and true to God's Will, and you and me and many others will continue upon that journey, that great effort to open the door to truth to humanity.

When I walked the earth, the ideas of men, the philosophies and perspectives were limited, and in that was difficult to convince many of these truths. Though certainly many of my friends were spiritualists and understood the existence of the spirit world in regard to religion and spirituality, they had a limited vision and understanding. Was only my close friends who came to know the truth of God's Love, and it that took many years to publish these books and messages, and indeed in God's timing, this is how the truth unfolds, in increments and drops of truth, fed to the souls who are eager and receptive.

So, you will find in your day, though minds are often more open, that there are still many biases, that the focus lies elsewhere. That many are very interested in the metaphysical nature of human existence, and they find it difficult to go beyond that which is of the mind, and to focus upon the soul.

So, you must, my beloved friends, continue to draw the focus of many to the benefits and blessings that may come with the Divine Love, and show them, demonstrate to them, the power of this Truth, the beauty of this Truth, the wonderment which is the great gift of the Highest Love of the Creator, our Beloved God.

As you toil away, my beloved brethren, as you do the work that you feel inspired to do, as you continue in your travels and in your communications with others, although it is of a somewhat meagre nature compared to the vast numbers and quantities of souls upon the Earth, it is making a difference. It is working towards the awakening and upliftment of humanity, and you will see the fruits of your labours, my friends, as I have seen the fruits of mine.

So, the chain continues, that chain of service, one to another, passing on the treasures of truth, the way that humanity may find and discover its own soul. Never give up, my friends, but continue to put your gaze forward, step-by-step, you will find your way, will come to know God's Will in your life, will carry the Torch of Truth, further into the realms of humanity so that it may light the way for many and help them to come to understand their true selves and the true nature of the universe.

Yes, there is much work to do, much effort to be made, much focus to begin upon this work. Each of you are up to that task in your own way, you will fulfil a part of this vast plan that God has put into motion and will find its expression and application upon the world. Yes, the entire world will come to know the choice of the Divine Path and that of the natural man.

Indeed, God's Plan is great and intricate and powerful. It is like an undercurrent in the ocean, but that undercurrent drives the direction of the flow, and so it is with humanity. You become a palpable and true expression of this current of truth, this Will of God. And you will be strengthened with each and every day as you pray and continue to yearn for the Gift of Love, and as you grow in this way, as your souls expand and are cleansed and transformed in this way, so God's Plan becomes more evident through you, and it shall indeed, reach many others.

For God does not waste any resource or opportunity to help uplift humanity. The only thing that restricts the expression of God's Plan and Will through an individual is by those constrictions of the mind in that sense of limitation that comes with a soul that continues to develop, but is yet tender and must grow in strength.

So, you are being developed, beloved friends, you are becoming that which God intends for you. Have faith in this. Continue to seek, to grow, and be strengthened in God's Love. Ask for the guidance that you need, require, to serve humanity, and it will be given to each of you individually and through various channels and ways to communicate. It will be given.

God's Plan is not a mystery, but it becomes mysterious when the mind extrapolates and impresses upon it ideas that are not in harmony with His Plan. In essence, God’s Plan is simple: to help guide humanity towards greater light and truth, and this comes to each individual. The yearnings and longings of the soul are sparked by God’s Touch, and as that spark comes to consciousness, so there is a longing, a desire to seek truth.

This is something you all know and have felt, and you may encourage and reassure others that they have been Touched by God, and that they are seeking, but all of humanity is seeking, the truth. The truth in all its glory.

So, it is meant to come to the world, the truth of love, the truth of God, the truth of creation. And the many, many aspects of God's Creation that ignites curiosity in the minds of many, and so it will come in unexpected ways, through unexpected sources. It will come, and you will be surprised, but you will find that you will add your piece of this great puzzle, this great plan, and when you gain enough perspective, you will come to recognize the magnificence of God's Great Plan for humanity, and how He is influencing every soul upon this world. That great undercurrent is powerful and will continue to help humanity grow and lift humanity up to a higher level of understanding, of truth, of love.

So, you see, we all play our part and continue to do so, whether you are in the flesh or in spirit. There are many thousands, millions, making great efforts to help humanity to find its way home, to their own selves, and the truth that resides within their soul, and the understanding that will come from the soul.

May God bless us all in this great journey of love and awakening and the healing of your world, and all the dark worlds, so the light may be the only aspect of life, and the darkness may dissipate and disappear so that harmony may reign upon your world and in all worlds. This is God's Plan, to bring harmony to His Creation. And so, we play our part, and so we are His instruments in the great outpouring of His Will upon the Earth and in spirit.

God bless you, my friends. I acknowledge you for your efforts, your beauty, and your gifts, and they shall grow and expand. You will be surprized that what might come through you and from you in the coming years. May God bless you and help you to overcome all barriers to this, that you may truly seek the truth unencumbered by the human condition. Be clear and true and bright within yourselves that your souls may flourish in love.

God bless you, my friends. I am James Padgett. My love for each of you is so strong, and for these beautiful souls who are your host, my love is great, and know that I am close, as is Helen. We are close to you, beloved souls. Never doubt this but have faith that someday you will have a very close rapport with us so that indeed, there is no hesitation or doubt, but great purpose and focus on serving God. God bless you. My love is with you all. God bless you.
