# Any moment can be a prompt to be in Grace

Would you believe that each one of you has been in my thoughts today? You might expect me to say, *“But not for the same reason”* yet, in reality, it was for exactly the same reason. 

Although each one lives in different circumstances with different challenges, different blessings, in different places on their journey, yet there is a longing not only to receive the Father’s Love, but a very real desire to come together in the safety of this prayer circle, this study group. Beyond those similarities, there is also each individual’s choice during the day of what to focus on, what to engage in. Each one of you has, let us say different responsibilities, and yet there can always be a space for God, for a reflection, if even in a moment, reminding you of your connection in Love, in oneness, in the sanctity of this communion. 

Any moment can be a prompt to just be in grace: *“Thank you, Father. Help me, Father. May my angels be with me. May my family be blessed. May someone be healed.”* There is great power in sending out a loving intention or having a visual of someone and surrounding them in love and light. You can even do this when someone is confronting you, rather than react to that negativity, taking it to heart, letting it disrupt the harmony of the day. This is what is meant by loving your enemies. And though it is not easy from the mind’s viewpoint, when the soul is rested in the love of God, it is quite simple. And the more one is rested in His Love, the easier it becomes to feel compassion for those out of harmony, those who would hurt you, those who are surrounded by lower spirits, and are not only themselves disturbed, but are prompted to disturb others. When you are in a place of harmony, this is quite easy to perceive. And when your heart feels the Love of God, just send that out. Bless each one. 

So I will ask you this, perhaps tomorrow, at some point during your day, when anyone who appears in your field of vision, or hearing, or physically, send them a blessing, internally from your soul, *“God bless you. May God’s Love and peace be upon you.”* If you proceed with that, then any words you speak will carry a beautiful blessing of your soul to another. As always, I am delighted to be here. I am with you, and I love you, more than you know. I am Care.
