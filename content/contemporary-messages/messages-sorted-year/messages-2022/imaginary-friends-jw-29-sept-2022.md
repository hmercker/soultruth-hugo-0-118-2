# Imaginary Friends

Hello my friends. It is I Fred, Fred Rogers. I was drawn into your circle today by the reading<sup>1</sup> which included the little boy and the beautiful writing accompanying such a beautiful message about passing over. It was in fact not unlike my own experience although I didn’t save any children in that regard. I entered calmly and without fear into the land of surprises and immortality. And I see that each one of you finds great comfort in the descriptions of the land of spirit and the knowing that God’s Love is there and so much happiness. 

As you know, I continue to work with children who cross over into this realm and on that note, I ask  each one of you to bless every child and inform them that they each have a guardian spirit, a guardian angel if you like. Then they can begin to recognize something beyond the world which as young children they are very capable of doing. And when you plant that seed given the right environment it will grow and be nurtured and carry the wonder into adulthood.
 
At some point many adults remember having an imaginary friend as a child. Some children see this friend and others just intuit it and often to the astonishment of their parents, are having a conversation with this friend. And under the right circumstances the parents begin remembering that they too once had an imaginary friend.
 
So tell the little ones of what awaits in a kind and loving way because what most of what is sent out on earth about death and crossing over is in a sense barbaric and often filled with fear and violence and horror. The airwaves are full of this; films are full of it. Thus one cannot be surprised at the state of the earth when this is what is constantly in the airwaves. When you draw children into the realm of angels of love of beauty, you give them a glimpse of hope and trust without fear. This is a great service and one can even do with adults if you can draw them out of the din and chaotic stories so pervasive on earth into the wonder and beauty of God’s love and what awaits in spirit. 

You are so blessed to have the great truth from your Celestial angels. And you are in sense spiritually evolved and represent the future of humankind. I can tell you that those here not only support you but honor your efforts with delight. So, continue on this journey to the Celestial heavens where we shall come together in the Glory, in the Love, in the profound happiness that is Divine. 

I am your brother and friend in the love of God in Christ. May God, bless your work, your words, your songs, your poems, and all the children of earth. With all my love till I come again I am Fred Rogers. God bless you.
