# How to be in the world and not of it

I am here your sister in Christ, Eileen Caddy. How does one live in this world and yet not be of it? What does it take to be engaged in the human condition and also to have one’s soul engaged in the love of God - one foot in heaven and one on earth? 

For some it a matter of submerging with passion into a discipline that brings them joy, that gives them a sense of being lifted above the world. And in what you call the natural love there are many pathways, loving pathways such as yoga, sport, working the earth, serving others, caretaking, building community, promoting a healthy and sustainable lifestyle, connecting with the earth in ecological ways and all these are good. They offer balance to the rampant materialism that so overwhelms the planet and our senses. Therefore I sought sanctuary and even sanctuary within sanctuary so I could listen with my soul and receive guidance from on High. 

And as I have mentioned many times, and written about, and most of you are well aware of, from this desire to connect came not only a community of thousands of souls seeking sanctuary, wanting oneness, wanting to be of service. Of course, my guidance was based on connecting with God, receiving His love and being in service every step of the way in a real and still existing sustainable village. Of course, in the ebb and flow of life some of the original intention in my community has ebbed and yet the souls who still come wish to serve, wish to be in Oneness, and are beginning to revive the practice of being in prayer and being open to the infilling and inflowing of the Creators love, which indeed does lift one up and at the same time engages one. 
  
You are my dear friends who have received the gift of the Father’s love in your souls. You already have one foot in the Celestial realm, though sometimes in the human condition you lose track of that, and you get involved or sidetracked with all the goings on in your daily lives; all the drama, all the news. And yet, because the longings of your souls have brought you into Oneness with the Creator, we will never let you stray too far. And when you call, we come. And when you are in pain,we ask you to let go and allow this love to lift you that you may be in your soul until the pain diminishes in the knowing that this too, will pass.
