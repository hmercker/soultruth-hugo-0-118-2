My friends, I am Seretta Kem. Indeed, these two instruments have suffered a minor setback in their intentions to be of service in the world. But it is important to acknowledge that for every effort and intention given to serve God and to be an instrument of light, there are often opposing forces to these efforts. And as you well know, the conditions of your world are not conducive and often unreceptive to the Will of God and the workings of God. The human condition is a powerful force in your world. It is the force that determines much in your world. Yet, each of you continue to dedicate yourselves to help neutralize these conditions, to be God’s instruments in the world in ways that uplift and heal and awaken humanity. 

You are strong, beloved souls, each of you carry a strength, a beauty of the soul, a light that is formidable. Yet, as God has created each individual soul with free will upon this earthly plane, neither you nor we can control the choices of others. We may offer alternative solutions, a path towards greater light and truth, love and comfort, many things to help uplift your brothers and sisters, but if they so choose to turn away from these blessings, then we cannot nor can you force the matter. It is contrary to God’s laws. So we must all accept that the flow of God’s Will often meets barriers, and as water finds its way, so the Will of God will find its way in any condition and circumstance. 

This you must bear in mind when you encounter disappointments and resistance from others, judgements and anger. Rather than react in defensiveness and fear and whatever human response you may have, these things come as a test. So the test invites you to respond with love and acceptance, with the strength of truth, but that truth being presented with a gentleness and humility that indicates the reflection of the Will of God and the expression of God which has unconditional love for all. You will carry on in your efforts, beloved souls, and God will open many doors so that you may do so.  At times, some of these opportunities are taken from you because of the will of another. Yet, remember that the course of God’s Love is like water running, flowing, that will eventually find its course and destiny. So it will be with each of your efforts and each of God’s plans for the salvation of humanity. 

God’s plan is relentless and it has intention and purpose with every moment. It is for you to be in alignment with this and allow His intentionality, His desire for the release of humanity from the shackles of their own making, the error which is so predominant, the darkness that overshadows the world, so to come to light, to come to peace, to come to truth. These things shall indeed come forward for every soul. Whether it be upon this earthly plane or in the planes of spirit, it must come. For the destiny of every soul is to progress into light and truth and to come to that place of the purified and perfect man or the Celestial Angel. It is the destiny of each soul, and because there is a choice, they must come to realize that they have a choice. 

This is where you come to speak your truth, beloved souls, to speak of two loves: the love that humanity has within itself as given by God to each and every soul, and the Love that is given by God upon request by that soul so that it may inflow into the souls of humanity . Those who desire it and long for it, who want to progress beyond the natural state in its pure form, to that place of unlimited and eternal love. This is the message that you must bring to your brothers and sisters. It is a simple message, but for you to do so, you must be exemplary in this love, putting aside all judgements, conditions that would hold you into this human condition. It is your challenge. For to be a teacher you must be an example. To be an example, you must be committed to whatever truth you carry, and to be committed to this truth you must pray earnestly and often for the continuance of the awakening of your soul in Love. This is what is set before you at this time, my beloved brothers and sisters. 

Yes, we continue to develop your gifts, help you upon this road so that all that is a potential within you may be expressed and expressed clearly and beautifully through you and in your lives. The key to everything is the soul’s awakening to love, and as you are challenged by the dark conditions of your world, you must step forward in loving response, always. It is a prerequisite to your journey.

Indeed, that journey presents to you many challenges, many choices, and many opportunities to grow and strengthen in light and truth. You long to be God’s pure and beautiful instruments, and so in time, you will be as you continue to progress along this Divine path. I encourage you to set your sights high, for the highest, and seek to  be in the purity and wonderment that is God’s Love transforming your soul and bringing you to that place of truth and wisdom, of love and joy. It is within your grasp, beloved souls.

May you seek to have the Will of God for you and within you, fulfilled in all its glory, in all its possibilities, in all its wonderment, to truly, truly be God’s clear and beautiful instrument of love, channelled for His Will and light and blessings for the world. I bless you on your journey. I pray with you, as do many. You have legions of angels supporting you, legions of bright spirits attending to you, and wondrous spirits from other planets who come forward to assist you. The power of this is immense. But each of you determines what may flow through you, how you may constrict or open to this immense power and light. The choice is yours with each day. It continues to be a choice, and you continue to respond each and every moment to the gift of life and the possibilities and opportunities that come with it. 

May you step forward in wisdom, my beloved friends. Step forward in faith. For the power of faith is immense and beautiful. May you step forward in love, for is this not the highest of truths, to be a channel of love in this world and to walk this world in peace, to be in joy, and to have faith that God’s Will may be done in your lives? God bless you beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem, ever at your side, ever willing to guide and uplift and support you in a world that is difficult but, indeed, the possibilities are great for light. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
