Gibsons, BC, Canada

Matthew received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Matthew. The journey may seem long, my beloved souls, but it is short. Within this time on the earth plane that you share together, are you not upholding the great truth of God's Love in such a way that you may make the most of what you have been given by God? The potentials that God has within each life, each soul, may be realized. The truth that is the creation of God and the Love of God is given freely to each of you.

You band together in this light, this Circle of Light, in order to find these truths and act upon them and be that affirmation of truth to one another, proclaiming that you have indeed found God's great and deep touch upon your soul and that you pray together to continue upon this journey of awakening, of love, of enlightenment and peace and truth. Beloved souls, continue upon this journey, continue together as brothers and sisters and see one another as indeed the great gifts that you are to one another, the great gift that you may affirm together, the truth of God's Love, that you may be the testimony to this truth and share this testimony and be an example of it to one another.

Beloved souls, you are truly beautiful in your light, you are truly filled with great potential, great possibility. May you come to know and realize all that you are, all that you can be within the great blessing of God's Love, the great journey of soul awakening, the beautiful gift of life. Indeed as you grow in this light, as you live this truth, so you become the channels of light and truth for others. Many see you and seek you within their souls though within their consciousness, their minds, they do not know why there is this draw to each of you but their souls know and their souls will answer that call provided you are bright and open and loving, embracing all you meet. So that call will be answered, so that soul will find what it seeks through you and in that touch, that connection, that joining together of souls, yours with others, you affirm the truth and you share the truth. Each of you looks skyward to God, your Heavenly Father, to find your way together, to be with God in the blessing and peace and upliftment that is God's touch upon each of you.

Together you will be strong, beloveds, together you will find your way for each has a piece of that great puzzle of life to share with one another. Each one through their struggles and their triumphs and their awakenings will bring wisdom and truth and insight to one another. Such a blessing to be a part of this Circle of Light, such a gift from God that you have found one another and that each that comes will be guided and join this circle, ever greater numbers, ever greater light. As you choose together in love you will be a formidable force in the world. Pray for the great gift of God's blessing upon your soul. Pray for the continued awakening of your conscious self to all that this gift may give in insight and perception and joy and light and truth. You will all be together, bonded for all eternity in the truth and light of God's Love.

God bless you, I am Matthew and I come to you in prayer and love in a deep desire to uphold you all in the great light and truth that is God. God bless you, beloveds, my love is with you. God bless you, beloved souls.
