# May You Find Unity and Harmony Together

December 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Vancouver Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Orion received by Al Fike

Oh, blessed children of light, I am Orion. May you find unity and alignment together so that you may be a formidable force of light in the world, for it is in the unifying of others and yourselves in this world, bringing light, bringing truth forward that the world will flourish in harmony with the Laws and creation of God. This is a universal truth that where there is love, where there is harmony, there is life and that as you continue to explore and understand true life through awakening, through existence in the universe of God then you will become more harmonious together and with greater unity for in your soul-to-soul bonding you will have a sense, a true sense of one another.

Be true to your souls. May your souls continue to be nourished by the great Love of God for it is in this nourishing of soul that harmony comes, that unity is formed, that a power of light is gathered in one single ray and glow and perfect expression, that the Laws of God may be expressed in this unification, this gathering together of many beautiful souls, an affirmation of the truth, an expression of light and love. As you incite the laws by prayer and longing of the soul, so the light pours forth and the great blessings are yours to be had. As you bask in this light of love, as you breathe in this light of love, as you acknowledge the great Truth of God’s Love for you, so you will know harmony and unity and so you will know joy, the fulfillment of the soul. This deeper place within you is coming alive, responding to this great blessing. As you respond in this way, as the soul flourishes by bathing in Love and absorbing Love and being transformed by Love, so the light grows brighter with each of you who walk in this grace, the beauty of this Love Divine.

May you feel the unity, my beloved friends. May you know as you grow in this Love, as you acknowledge this universal blessing, this truth, so you become unified with other souls, throughout the universe, who are also in alignment with this truth and benefitting from this blessing. This will make a formidable force that will help your planet, your Earth to flourish in light and to be in greater harmony with God’s Laws for humanity does not know its own power and capacity to influence the world either for good or for darkness, for harmony or that which is disharmonious.

So, humanity must learn these lessons, understand what they carry within them, what God has given them as a birthright to live in this world and to live within the parameters of free will, to find within themselves the great potentials and abilities of the soul, of the spirit, of the mind, all of these things coming together with unity, with grace forming a powerful consciousness within each individual.

As you grow within your soul thereby establishing a powerful centre of light within you, so you will come to recognize your true abilities and capacities. So, you will join the rest of humanity, for humanity does not just exist here on this planet but on many others. So, you will join the family of God’s children in the universe. In this, a powerful light is formed and shall be blessed upon your world. These interconnections of souls, your brothers and sisters who exist beyond you, beyond your comprehension, but nonetheless there is a bond of soul-to-soul which will become more evident as you grow in love, as you awaken in perception and capacity to see and know and understand the wonderment of God’s universe.

I urge you to pray for this gift of Love, to make it a priority in your life, to seek it out, to prove to yourself that this truth is real, that this blessing is truly what I say it is and that the reality of God’s universe may come to you in your consciousness and understanding of life. These things are possible but it requires your effort. It requires an acknowledgment of the laws that God has placed within the universe. It requires the opening of your soul, your centre, and connecting with God’s Great Soul, His Centre so that there is this interchange of the Essence that is of God that you may receive and grow within it, and that bond beyond you and your Creator may be powerful, may be beautiful, and may bring great manifestations and experiences to the consciousness of yourself for as each one grows in this consciousness, so they are assisting their brothers and sisters in this world of yours to grow in theirs.

The power of the life that you may carry in this way will open the doors for many others to experience these things and to know this truth. May you all find your way to these great revelatory experiences, awakenings of the soul so you may truly be a light, that you may truly be an instrument for harmony and truth and peace in the world. God gives you every opportunity, my friends, to find your way upon what I know is a circuitous road, one that has many obstacles. But still, God continues to shine the light forth, to show you the way ahead so that your souls may flourish in Love, awaken, and be counted as a true light in the universe.

May God bless you, my friends, I am Orion. My love is with you. Many, many souls are with you in your efforts. Continue to be in alignment as you seek the truth and awaken to the light. God bless you, my friends. God bless you and keep you in love.
