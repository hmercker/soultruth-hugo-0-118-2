Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here Judas.

My dear brothers and sisters you have come a long way. You have been given much, everything one would need on the path of Divine Love, for your souls to progress. Many times, what we bring is simply a reminder to pray. For prayer brings you into rapport not only with the Love of God, but your souls with our souls in the celestial realm, and it brings many visitors into your circle. Those who progressing, who see the light and come, and are drawn by it. You will notice in your earth lives whenever you are in a state of grace, or even just sharing with someone the truths of Gods Kingdom, of prayer, of Divine Love, you are lifted up and they are drawn to you. 
 
Now is a good time to revisit not only [the messages that I gave to Hans](https://new-birth.net/conversations-with-judas-of-kerioth/communications-from-judas-kerioth/), but contemporary messages that will help you, as well as what James Padgett received and others. And it is wonderful to feel your amazement and delight as you read descriptions of the spirit world and the wonders therein and you can feel, compared to the earth plane, the amount of light and magnificence in the realms of progression. 
  
So, continue to revisit what has been received. Stay in hope, stay in faith and not fear. Stay in trust, in this skeptical world, that you may stay in light and dissipate the darkness, as is your calling, as is your service, as are your lives. We thank you. 

I shall step back now in the beautiful silence and stillness in the presence of Almighty God and His Love. I love you. I am your brother in Christ a redeemed soul and an inhabitant of the celestial heavens. I am Judas. God bless you.
