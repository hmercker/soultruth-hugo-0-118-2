Bartholomew received by Al Fike

I am Bartholomew and yes, you have identified my relationship with this dear soul. I will continue to come and be by his side as he makes great leaps and bounds towards light and love everlasting.

Open yourselves to the changes that God intends for each one of you. Do not shirk from God's compelling desire to have you in alignment with His plan for each of you. Know that you are loved, that His Love continues to flow in great abundance. Be in harmony with His Love and Will and all will come in harmony with your life. May you have the insight and discernment to know God’s Will, that your souls may open to God’s Will and that you may consciously know this and come to understand the steps that you must take.

Much has been given to each of you at this time, opening doors that in the past seemed unlikely and unobtainable. But now comes the moment, the time when you will step through many doors and acknowledge many opportunities that God lays before you and that you will see for yourselves the power of God's blessings, the wonderment of His plan for each of you. The beauty of the flow of His Love manifests through you and all your gifts flourish in the warmth of His Love.

May God bless you on that journey, beloved souls. I am Bartholomew and I am with you on this journey, as are many in the Celestial Kingdom who come to assist humanity in this great transformation, this great shift of consciousness, this great acknowledgement of love that is meant to be in this world of yours. A whole new world created out of love, out of God's Touch, out of His instruments of Light assisting God in forming what must come for the salvation of humanity and the upliftment of this world.

May you know the deep peace that comes with His Love. May you be truly an instrument of His Will. May you recognize the wonderment of your own soul that it may awaken and flourish In the blessings of His Love. God bless you, my friends. God bless you and keep you in truth and love and light. God bless you.
