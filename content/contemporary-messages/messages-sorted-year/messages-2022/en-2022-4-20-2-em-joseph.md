# Blessings for Everyone on the Ship

April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Soul Awakening Tour, Holland America Cruise

Joseph received by Elizabeth Mack

Lift up your souls for the great blessings of God’s Love to pour into your souls. There are many who are here with you. Open wide, receive and accept, for God has blessed you greatly this day. Turn your eyes to God. Keep them steadfastly on the Father. God will bring you through all that is coming. Keep your eyes on God so you know where you are headed. You are each blessed abundantly. The wealth of God’s Love is within you. You are blessed. I am Joseph of Arimathea. We are one with the Father.
