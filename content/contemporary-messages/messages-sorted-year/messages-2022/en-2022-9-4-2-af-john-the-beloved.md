# All are Transformed, Awakened and Healed in God’s Love

September 4<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

John the Beloved received by Al Fike

May God’s Love be with you, beloveds. I am John, known as John the Beloved. I come to pray with you today and encourage you in your efforts to seek God. For it is in God that all solutions are possible, all dilemmas are healed, all travels upon your Earth are blessed. For it is in the Love of God that you are transformed and awakened, healed and protected, that God’s guidance may enter into your consciousness, beloved souls. God’s great blessing of His Love grows within you, expanding your heart so that you will experience and express His Love through you, His Essence bringing to each and every soul you meet, a blessing, as it is manifest within your soul, opening that channel of blessings to others.

You recognise that you are His children, that you walk within the grace of His Love, that you are seeking greater love and greater light in your lives. May your search be answered with the blessings of God upon you, awakening you to the truth, showing you the way towards the greater light that you long for, the greater love that your soul seeks and recognises. And that in this, you will know God, you will know God as your personal and beloved Father, source of all love, Creator of all things. It comes with sincere prayer, beloveds. It comes from the yearnings of your soul and your heart set forth on the wings of prayer.

Beloved souls, may you be blessed mightily in these moments of prayer. May you come to know the truth in such a way that it is embedded in your heart and your soul for all eternity, that you will be a child of the truth, forever forsaking that which is of error. May you be His true child. With faith, you trust in your Heavenly Father. With love, you reach out to His Hand to be led, to be carried, to be guided, to be blessed.

All is given to those who are sincere in their desires. All befalls those who are open to the blessings of God. Be that simple child, knowing that you are truly blessed and truly known, with resounding faith and knowledge that God loves you and that God’s Love is a gift to your soul.

God bless you, beloveds. I am John, and I too love you, as do all the angels of the Celestial Kingdom. Their love for you is great. So we journey together in the wondrous truth and revelations of God’s blessings upon us. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you.
