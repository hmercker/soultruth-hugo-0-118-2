# The Soul Touched by God is the real Proof

I am here Thomas the Apostle. I come in the love of God, a disciple of the Master and your brother in Christ. I wish to talk about proof and evidence, which in so many areas of life are required. 

Even in the area of mediumship those who channel are often called evidential mediums. This is because someone can verify their relationship to the person that is coming through. This is a gift of the mind and a beautiful gift as it provides a window into life beyond the earth plane of the existence of a life beyond in the spirit world. 

I would say in general however, that while the spirits that speak through these mediums can be progressive, they are generally not on the path of Divine Love, and almost never Celestials. Nevertheless, those who provide this service do a very good thing in acquainting those on the earth plane with their loved ones in the spirit world. Divine Love mediums that we speak through, cannot generally provide evidential proof because we communicate soul to soul. And while the information goes through the brain and the language and the filters of the medium, the connection is a higher connection that only the soul can receive, of course translated to some extent by the brain and the language and knowledge of the medium.

You may know all too well the story of Thomas the Doubter who required proof that the Master had risen. And though he was told, though I was told, I wanted proof because I could not fathom that Jesus could be present with us in physical form. So, I required physical proof, and the Master provided the proof while he lovingly admonished me and the others to remember those who have not seen and yet believed, how blessed are those. I raise this subject because many on this path also at times want to require physical evidence, some manifestation, an appearance, in order to prove that we Celestials are communicating. 

But I tell you this, I understand the desire that you have, those of you who wish so much to feel and touch and see that you can believe and have your faith strengthened. The manifestation of God’s love in your soul is the real proof. It is the substance when possessed by the soul that is the true manifestation of what you all seek. This substance is brought about in humble prayer, in deep longing for God’s love and its inflowing into your souls. So there will be those for whom seeing, and touching is believing, but how blessed are those who have felt the love of God in their very being as a real substance, His Essence transforming your soul and lifting it in light and love. 
 
I thank my brother for agreeing to take this message and for understanding that I do not wish to judge but to clarify a great truth. May the love of God fill each one, awaken each one, and transform each one. I am your brother from the Celestial Kingdom. I am Thomas the Apostle. God bless you.
