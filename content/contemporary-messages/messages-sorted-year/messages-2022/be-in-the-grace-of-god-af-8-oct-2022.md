I am Mylora. Godâ€™s soft kiss upon your cheek as He places His hand on you, claiming you for Himself in love, seeking your awakening, your journey towards at-onement with Him, so that you may be redeemed in love, healed in love, awakened in love.

Feel His touch, urging you to rise above the human conditions into that place of grace and light. Know his word as He beseeches you toward all that is good and of light and love. Know the power of His Love to heal you, to uphold you, and to bring to you all that you require to be in harmony with His laws of love, His universe of love.

May all that holds you from that place fall away from each of you, and may you step forward and declare yourselves as children of God. For every soul upon your world is a child of God, but few acknowledge this. Few understand the meaning of this. For God is the Great Soul and is nothing but soul, and you have been given the gift of a soul. So, in this way, you are connected with your Creator, and in this way, you may communicate with the Creator. But you must put aside those conditions and thoughts that hold you in the human condition, which detracts from the soul though your minds are busied, as your minds continue to seek elsewhere for gratification. It is your soul that knows the way, and it is entrusting in your soul and being truly in alignment with God through your prayers and your longings, your desires, that God will truly touch you and bring you to that place of awareness, of knowing.

For that possibility is within each of you, beloved souls. It is within every soul. For this is why God has given you soul, that you may be truly with Him and be in alignment with all that is with Him. That you may receive the touch of His Love, the Divine Essence, to flow within you and heal the wounds within, heal all that which is not love within you. 

This is true redemption, beloved souls. For with this healing and this touch you are transformed, and you may one day become a divine angel and reside within the Celestial Kingdom. May you find your way there, that wondrous place where joy abounds and all that is of God is acknowledged and recognized, and the Angels exist within this place of love eternal, of joy expanding, for all eternity and glorious light that is of God.

My beloved friends, be in the grace of God. Seek His Love now. Open yourselves to His touch and all these things of which I speak will be yours. In time you will find your way and you will know the joy of it, the wonderment of it, the beauty of it. Your soul comes alive, awakening and being transformed in love. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Mylora, and I come to pray with you. I am your friend. I am with you and shall be as we take this journey together, beloved souls. God bless you. God bless you deeply in His Love, and I love you.
