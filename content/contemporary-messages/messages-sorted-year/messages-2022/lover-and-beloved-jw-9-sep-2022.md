# Lover and Beloved  

September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here Inayat Khan, your brother in the love of God. I was guiding my brother today, so I was around during your lively discussion on understanding the ‘form’<sup>1</sup> of God. I wish to speak about something in parallel to that discussion which is the use of the word, “Beloved”. 

Of course, like the term ‘Divine Love,  it can be misconstrued or used to mean something very unlike what you all know Divine Love or God’s love, to be. In the East and most especially in the writings of the Sufi poets that you are aware of such as Rumi, Hafiz, and perhaps Attar and others, they often use the terms *‘lover and beloved’*, lover meaning the spiritual aspirant, the spiritual devotee, and Beloved, God. These terms of the Sufi poets are used in the form of a Divine romance of the lover seeking the Beloved and the Beloved drawing in the lover. Sometimes you see an expression of drunkenness or intoxication used, and by the that poets mean to be intoxicated with the love of God, the wine being His love. 

In the West many Celestial angels you have heard from use the term, "Beloved", and it is generally meant as a ‘dear one’, as in beloved friends, my beloved spouse, or soulmate. But I wish you to understand that when this word comes from a Celestial angel, they are saying they love you with the love of God. Hence in this sense you are as if the lover being addressed with the love of God as a beloved one. In the bigger picture there is really no difference in how these terms are used. The greater meaning being God’s love or to be loved with God’s love. I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have about the use of this word or these words. 

And I do hope the message from the Master on the true form of God resonates with each one of you as you feel His love come into your soul as a real substance. So, my beloved friends, may each one of you move beyond the words into the Presence of the Creator receiving His essence, His love, so that each one of you is changed, transformed. This is our wish for you. 
  
And one last thing I wish to say. Trying to encapsulate such terms is a bit like trying to capture a melody. When you hear a beautiful song the feeling of that song stays with you and touches your heart even though the song has now gone back into the ether in some formless place. Such is the love of God. 
 I thank you allowing me to come through and I thank this one for singing praises to the Heavenly Father. For we are all truly one in His love. I am your brother in Christ in the love Divine. I am Inayat Khan. May peace be upon you. God bless you.
