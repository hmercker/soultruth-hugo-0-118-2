# The True Meaning of Christmas

December 18<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

It is your teacher, Augustine. You are approaching a time where you celebrate the birth of our beloved Master Jesus, and I urge you to live his message, a message that we have made great efforts to bring to the world after being lost for so long, a message that is clear and unequivocal in its nature. It is the message of love. It is a message that brings the soul to Godâ€™s Love. It is a message that urges all upon the world to express love in all that they are and all that they do. It is a simple message but a powerful message, for within the Love of God, the soul is transformed and claimed by God.

Each of you know well, the power of this Truth. Each of you have discovered the deep Touch from God that is His Love. Each of you have found your way to God through prayer and beseeching His great Soul to bless you with His Essence. This truth must be shared. It can be shared by your light, your presence in the world. It can be shared by your teaching of it. It can be shared by your gathering together, affirming the truth that it is, that each of you are beacons of light in the world. Dotted around this globe, you shine your light forth. You are a testimony to this Truth.

In this time of acknowledging the birth of the Master, may you shine forth in truth and light and love to all that you meet. Whatever activities you partake in, may it be a reflection of honoring our beloved brother who came to this world to bring the highest truth, the greatest gift that humanity might ever know and come to understand. We in the Celestial Kingdom honor each of you for your dedications. Even for those who are new and curious and desire the truth, we honor you. For you have stepped beyond the veil of human condition and found your way to the Light and clarity that is the Father's Love exemplified and offered as a gift to you and to all.

We continue to pray for the world, and we ask you to continue in your prayers for this world of yours, a world that is suffering, a world that is lost in darkness, a world that struggles each and every day, each and every moment. Yet the solution is given, the opportunity to release the pain, to follow the truth that is in your personal relationship with God. It is simple indeed but alludes so many. Beloved souls, seek to live the truth with every breath. Seek to be the truth in every act. Seek to be a channel of love for God and in this, all goodness will follow, all blessings will come.

Beloved and beautiful students, you are the light of the world. May your light connect with other lights in the world and bring about a powerful Lattice of Light that will encircle the globe and influence all who live upon it, bringing truth and healing and peace to a world so in need of all of these things, but most of all, to bring love, to bring love. God bless you, my friends, students of truth. May you continue to grow in His Love and have the experience of the soul awakened to His Love, to His universe, to His Soul.

God bless you; I am your teacher, Augustine. I wish you merriment and joy in this time together in the world, acknowledging the birth of Christ, acknowledging the Truth of Love, acknowledging the Light of God and His great beneficence upon you, the generosity of His Soul Touching each of you profoundly and deeply, transforming you and bringing you at-one with the great Creator of all. God bless you, beloveds, my love is with you. God bless you.
