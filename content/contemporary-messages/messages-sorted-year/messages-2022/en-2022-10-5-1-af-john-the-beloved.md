Pacific Coast Soul Awakening Tour, Menifee, CA, USA

John the Beloved received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloveds of God. I am John. You know me as John the Beloved. I come to encourage you in your journey to God that you may seek His Love with earnestness, dedication. That you may come into His presence more fully as Godâ€™s Grace envelops us. We are in His blessings, beloved souls, open your soul, opening ourselves to His Touch and be fully in the light of His Presence.

As you continue to awaken so the truth dawns upon you with all its glory and wonderment. So, the path opens for you as you begin to realize the truth that our beloved Master Jesus taught, the way of Love, the way of God's Love, all growing and blooming within you, expanding forth in light as you seek the benediction of the Creator upon you, beloved souls.

May you be awakened fully. May your soul inform you of all that is you, and all that is meant to be you on this journey, on this path. You seek earnestly, beloved souls, and yet when you know the truth, it is but a mere glimmer of what is in the universe of God. Absorb what God is giving to you. Bring it into your heart and your soul and your mind and truly embrace it, and in this way, God will feed you evermore of His Truth.

As you grow in His Love, so you are more capable of understanding and experiencing the truth. Be patient, beloved souls, be patient, and the stalwart of truth shall be yours forever, shall carry this banner wherever you go, and it shall be your light, it shall be your message, it shall be an expression of your love for humanity.

When we walked the earth, we needed to learn patience, perseverance, and faith. For we knew not what the next day would bring, only to trust in God's blessings and guidance. We became His instruments in the journey of life. We gave our life to God, our dedication, our desire to serve. So, it is for you to choose this, beloved souls, the road less travelled, the journey that so few truly understand.

Yet for you, God opens the door wide, He lays the path clear, and He invites you through this doorway to step upon the guided journey, the expression of His Will done, expressed, fulfilled by your unique and beautiful soul.

Truly release those conditions that would hold you from this path of service, for you ask  of your future, you ask of this journey, and all that can be said is that with dedication, perseverance, faith, and trust, God will lead you on a miraculous path, an expression so magnificent and unexpected that when your time comes to enter into the world of spirit, you will look back with joy and satisfaction and understanding why God has led you thus.

Release your reticence, your fears, and your biases, and go with God. For this truly is the journey that shall last forever, and you will mark your way by how many God has used you to touch and to awaken to the truth. You will know your way because the wisdom of your soul will impart that which you need to know to step forward once more.

Earnest souls, do you not seek this? Do you not feel the pull towards it? Your soul knows this. Your soul has been incarnated into this world to fulfill this purpose. Come to see it clearly, my friends. Come to know it fully. Come to live it in such a way that all is in harmony and light, and you will be truly an instrument of God who will touch many souls and bring many to their salvation.

Be at peace, beloveds, be at peace. Know that you have come to that place of awakening and truly manifesting the light of your soul. Beloveds, walk the path of God and see yourself upon it fully and open to all that God guides, that shows of you His Will, the fulfilment of his plan, the awakening of humanity.

I am with you, beloved souls, as are many. Trust in that which speaks to you, shows you the way, for it is your soul reflecting the Will of God. God bless you, beloved souls, and keep you in light upon this journey.  I love you, I am John, and I love you, my brothers and sisters for God.
