My friends, I am Yogananda. The journey towards light is a journey that is taken by each individual in their own individual way, their own timing, their own perspective and even to a degree, their own truth. But light must be attained within the individual. For without light, there is no true progress, nor no truth that is worth nurturing within you. If it is not of light, then it is not of value. 

You know the power and beauty of a great light, the highest light of all, the Essence of God, His very Being infused within your soul. There is no more powerful light than this, my friends, a light that ignites so much within you, a light that brings truth, a light that reflects the love of God. Without this light, your souls remain as they are. Though they may be purified and refined in light, but it cannot develop any further than that purity, that condition of light. The light of God is what brings the transformation, the awakening and the purification of the soul. It is so multidimensional in its characteristics. It is so powerful in its presence. It is so multidimensional in its existence in the Universe that what you gain through this light, the light of God’s love, is far greater in comparison to any other light and there are many qualities of lights in the world and in God’s Universe. There are many manifestations of God in the Universe, His healing blessings, His compassion for all, the light of life that is within everything. Many aspects of God’s creation reflect light but that very highest, purist, greatest of lights which is His Essence, is beyond compare and greater than any other blessing that may be given. 

Light will neutralize darkness. Light will bring harmony out of that which is out of harmony. Light will bring insight and understanding to the individual. Light can be the guiding force in one’s life. Yet, even all of these elements of light combined does not equal the great light that is conveyed to you in prayer, received with the desire of your soul to open to it and take it within you. 

There are many who are distracted by the various reflections of light in the Universe, the various aspects of God’s creation which are indicative of light but there is only one highest truth and greatest light and I urge you my friends to put your gaze upon this most wondrous light, to seek it, to allow it to transform you and awaken you. You may travel a hundred roads, a thousand roads that will bring you a great variety of experiences but there is only one road that leads to the great transformation that comes with the Divine Love. I urge you to take this road, my friends and I in my existence have travelled many roads, have experienced many things, many things that would interest and intrigue you all and would be unusual, even awesome in its scope but I have not experienced anything comparable to this experience of light that comes with the Essence of God, the pinnacle of light, the greatest of blessings, the most wondrous expression of God, given to humanity and all souls of the Universe who desire to receive it. 

You are given the gift of light. You may walk upon the path of light. You may come to understand that light is the reflection of God’s creation but truly, His very Essence which can be seen and recognized as light is His very love, the love that is the truth, the highest truth of all the Universe. Be in the light of God’s love, my friends. Walk upon this path of light. Seek to truly be in the light, a channel of light, your being infused with the light of God’s Essence. 

This is a simple teaching, but one that is profound and important. For light is everywhere. Yet there are many qualities of light and the highest and purest and greatest of those qualities is the light of God’s Essence, His love, shining forth to the Universe. 

May God bless you, my friends upon this journey. May you not be too distracted by those other qualities of light but focus and put your sights upon this great gift. For in this, all other experiences, gifts and expressions of light will follow. May you be blessed, my beloved friends, as you seek to know the truth, the depth and breadth of God’s Universe, the wonderment of God’s love for you, beloved souls. I am your friend, Yogananda. I am happy to be with you today as you gather and seek and pray together, truly a spiritual exercise in light. God bless you, my friends and keep you in His light, my beautiful, beautiful friends. God bless you.
