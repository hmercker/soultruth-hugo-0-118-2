# Powerful blessing and reassurance for Soul Awakening Tour

March 10<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to encourage you upon your journeys in the world. As you continue to bring light and comfort to many, so God is utilizing you to ignite and support the many Portals of Light in the world, and this is an important mission to do so before the time comes where such travels will be much more difficult. I encourage you to teach your brothers and sisters about how they may maintain these Portals of Light, how it is important to do so, to encourage those around you to be guardians and caretakers of these portals.

We will show you the existence of these portals as you continue to pray together in your groups and gatherings, and we will give guidance regarding these blessings from God. Allow yourself to be open, receptive to our guidance and God’s guidance so that you may be clear and in a good spiritual condition in order to receive the guidance and blessings that are to come through each of you and those who are gathered.

Our intention is to uplift, to educate, to inspire. God’s intention is to bring the great inflowing of His Love into their souls. It is a worthy mission, one that has taken your time and planning and resources applied to make it possible. Know that you will be protected and guided with each step you take, that we are drawing those who are eager and have a soul eager to be a part of such a group. It has taken as much planning as well from our side of life, and we are creating the conditions in those places and portals that will bring the highest blessings and possible manifestations as you travel and gather.

Be true to this mission, beloved souls. Encourage all who listen to this message to continue to support in prayer and love and even in material ways, this effort. It is an important mission, one that has been planned for a long time and one that will bring beautiful awakenings, openings, blessings to many. You will see the power of a group in harmony and together in prayer, the blessings of God’s Love, healing, upliftment, presence of His angels will be powerful and undeniable to those who are within these circles.

May you be blessed, beloveds, in your efforts and time, gatherings, prayers filled with joy, insights of Truth, soulful awakenings, gifts coming to the fore, Love, the highest Love of all, the Essence of God flowing, blessing all and flowing out through you through these circles to the world. It will be an extraordinary time, beloveds, a time of rejoicing, a time of releasing those conditions of the Earth and in joining with your angel friends and communing with the Creator in light and love.

May God bless you on this journey, beloved souls, and know that we will be close. You will be guided and protected and cared for. All will be well. All will be well. God bless you, my beloveds. I come to assure you, assure those who are part of this, that God’s Hand rests upon all of you and all that you do. God bless you. God bless you, my beloveds. I am with you always. I am with you evermore.
