It is your teacher Augustine. I wish to thank these two beloved souls who continue to listen to the call, to be guided forward and to travel this earth plane in response to the guidance given. It is important that these prayers are given in various locations in the world for as you gather, no matter the size of the Circle of Light, you are drawing in various spirits from these locations. They are being influenced and taught as you are being influenced and taught and blessed. So these efforts have many elements to them that are not readily perceived. 

When you enter into a place, a location, and you gather like-minded souls together who are seeking the Father's Love so you are opening up an opportunity for many others in spirit, many who are in dark spheres, undeveloped spheres, who are immature yet curious and are in need of light, and are blessed in this way. Consider this, beloved souls, that you may be used in this way and influence many hundreds, even thousands of souls who are seeking and who are lost. They see the light and they are drawn to the light and then through this instrument and through all of your instrumentalities there are many blessings given, many things accomplished amongst these crowds of spirits who are in need. So your work is multifaceted, powerful and beautiful.

I thank you, beloved souls, for your efforts. I thank you that you are continuing to allow yourselves to be carried to different locations, to be focused upon prayer and speaking of spiritual things for all of these aspects of your experience together are important. Be true to God's Will, beloved souls, and know that your instrumentalities and your gifts, all those things that are unique to you as an individual can be utilized by God to bring forth various blessings and great light into the world.

When that time comes that you pass into our side of life, you will be surprised as to how many know you and know of you for how many truly work in this way, how many are focused and clear upon the path, the highest path of all, that of God's Love. It is a great blessing indeed for many who encounter you, and there are many who do encounter you and you are not aware and yet you are surrounded at this time and each time you pray by many spirits. There is still much to do, a great work to be accomplished upon the world to shift the tides towards that of light rather than darkness, to bring truth rather than error to the minds of mortals and spirits, to clear the way for the changes that are inevitable, some of which are imminent. So you must prepare yourselves with each day to be used as God's instruments wherever you are. Whatever your day brings, may it start with prayer and an effort to be used as God's instruments, putting forth your desire inn prayer to be used in this way is important.

May you be blessed, my friends. You are truly blessed to have these opportunities, to be in alignment with this truth, so simple and profound and yet so misunderstood. Yet you have found your way. You continue to gain clarity and insight into this truth and to all that is of God. You shall continue to grow in this way as the Love continues to pour into your soul, changing you forever and bringing to you the insights and understanding that is of the soul, that part of you that shall indeed remain forever in the light and blessings of God. How wondrous is this, beloved souls, that you shall be in God's bosom for all eternity, that you shall know the peace, the joy, the wonderment, the truth, the light and the love of God. It shall grow forever. Can you fathom this, this great truth that a redeemed soul has eternal life and shall progress without end? Can you imagine in a thousand years of your earthly time what lights you will be, how beautiful will be your countenance, how deep will be your love, how expansive the wisdom that you will carry and how wondrous will be the blessings of your gifts expressed in the universe.

You only step forth upon the beginning, that tentative step into light and yet so much more awaits you, beloved souls, so much more awaits those who are persistent, filled with faith and love and light. So you are blessed, my friends, and you have been fortunate in your life to know this truth for it has enhanced and redirected your life in such a way that there is greater harmony, greater understanding and many experiences that affirm the truth. You will continue to find your way, the path will straighten as time progresses upon this world and in time you will not know yourselves as you have been but express yourselves as you are meant to be, a reflection of God's creation in all its beauty and all its wonderment and all its uniqueness and all its brilliance.

God bless you, my friends, beautiful students of the truth. I am your teacher Augustine and know that I walk with you every step, will continue to tutor you as to the steps to be taken, as to the truth to be understood, as to the efforts which are required to fulfill this vision of which I share of the eternal soul which shall expand in light forever. God bless you, my friends, my love is with you, my love and my presence is with you always. God bless you.
