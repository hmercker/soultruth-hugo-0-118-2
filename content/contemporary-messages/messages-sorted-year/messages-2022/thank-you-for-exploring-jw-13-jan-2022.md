# Thank you for Exploring

January 13<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here Robert Hugh Benson. I am here with my dear friend Anthony (Borgia). We come to thank you for exploring what I communicated to Anthony from my entrance into spirit to the time when I began to touch on the realms of Divine Love where I now live. 

My motivation back then was to try and correct the multitude of errors in my writings in the hopes that at least some of the followers of my writings, would find freedom from their adherence to the Orthodox doctrines of the churches. Since I was one they looked up to, or at least appreciated, I felt could give them something not only uplifting but true as a replacement. I attempted to show the reality of the spirit world and the Oneness of God and His love for all His children, the journey in light, the laws of progression, and of course the places where those in spirit dwell. 

I can say we are honored that you are revisiting what Anthony received from me and I hope that you will find much that is inspirational and is also in harmony with what you already know to be true, and I think you will. 

 May you enjoy this journey in spirit and may it give you a picture of the beauty and love that awaits you. I pray that each one of you will be filled with the love of God as I am now and those here who love you and guide you. It is our joy and I thank you for allowing me, as does Anthony,  this time. May God bless you. I am Robert Hugh Benson.

**Note** Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson wrote through Anthony Borgia some nine books although several were simply published with a different name at a later date. A full list is [on this page.](https://new-birth.net/mediumship/anthony-borgia-and-the-spirit-books-he-authored/)
