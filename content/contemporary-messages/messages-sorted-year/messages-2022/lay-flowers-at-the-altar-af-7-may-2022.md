# Asks us to Lay Flowers at the Altar of WHC

May 7<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Blackpool, U.K.

Received by Al Fike   



When you go to that place, I ask you to bring a few flowers and lay it upon the altar.

Those flowers indicate that God Loves all. To dedicate this altar to love.  Be loving channels while you are there in prayer.  Be the beautiful lights that you are. Be gracious and loving, embracing all you meet, and put aside any judgments you might have. Instead see this place for what it is: a beautiful source and center of light, and add your light and prayers to it to help ensure that it is enlivened in light, awakened in light, and powerful in light. 

God bless you, my friends, and I will put flowers upon you as well, my beautiful friends, my beautiful friends. God bless you.
