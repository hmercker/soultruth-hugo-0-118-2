December 9<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother, your friend, Jesus. The road is laid before you. The path has been cleared. God shines His Light upon this road so that you may see where you are going, so that you may know that all that is needed for you to traverse this road is given freely in love, in light, in the grace of God. There is nothing to hold you from this road, this road that takes you to at-onement with Him. You are blessed by God’s Hand. You are uplifted by God’s Love, transformed within your soul so that you may be clear and joyful and filled with love. For it is the power of love that will awaken you, will set the path before you. It is the power of love that will bring you to at-onement with God. It is the power of love that will bring to you the truth that you so long for, the power of love from your Creator that is the highest blessing of all.

So we walk this road together, my beloveds, beautiful brothers and sisters, we walk this road together for all eternity. We shall never forsake one another, but walk hand in hand. I am with you. I stretch out my hand to help guide you along. I give of my strength and my light and my love to reinforce and to uphold your journey. I give to you the fulness of my heart, for I love you dearly. But that love is but a pittance beside the love of God. The power of God’s Love is far beyond the scope of your measuring and reckoning, my beloved souls. The power of God’s Love fills the universe. It is given to you because you have acknowledged this great gift to all of God’s Creation, that He has ensured that His beloved souls, His children of His Creation, may have this gift. Only those who possess a soul may receive it and yet, all of you, all who are of humanity, all who possess a soul in the universe may receive this gift, given especially to those who long for it, who desire it, and is given as a personal gift from God to you.

May you find your way to love. May you know the road of love. May you come to express love in everything that you are and everything that you do. For this is God’s desire and His intention for each soul that they may find the fulfilment of love, that that love may flow freely, both into them and through them that they may be a light in the world. As you are greater lights, so you draw to you other lights, angels of the Celestial Heavens, many who seek to uphold you. The Law of Attraction brings this, the fulfilment of the Laws of Love ensure that you draw to you the bright spirits and angels and the Hand of God upon you. This great blessing is beyond all other blessings. It is above all other things, and it is the doorway, the key to all other blessings.

May you find your way, beloveds. Know that I am with you. Know as you come together in unity of prayer and desire that you are truly upon the path of light, of truth and love. In this great fulfilment, beloveds, great fulfilment of the soul that will envelope all of you, all your consciousness will be infused with this joy, infused with this awareness, this understanding, this peace and all things of love. What blessings you come upon, my beloved souls, what great and wondrous gifts given by God to each of you.

Be in His grace. Walk in the light of truth and love and we shall be brethren upon the road of salvation, of reclamation, of transformation. We are His children and proudly we walk on this path together holding hands, our faces shining bright, feeling the warmth of God’s Touch, our eyes shining with love and acknowledging that we are truly blessed. My beloveds, be in this grace. We are with God together and we shall walk the road together for all eternity. For all eternity. My love is with you. I am your brother and friend, Master of the Celestial Kingdom. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
