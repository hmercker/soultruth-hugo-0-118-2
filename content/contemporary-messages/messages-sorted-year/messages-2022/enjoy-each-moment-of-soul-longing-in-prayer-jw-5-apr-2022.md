It is I Care, I come with my dear sister and friend Claire to greet her *“kind mice”,* our barefoot ministry embracing you. Some of you have been on many journeys and for others new beginnings await you. At the end of the day, you can always evaluate how much joy, how much harmony, you have been in. It may be helpful to keep a diary in which you can express your personal thoughts and desires privately, and with the utmost honesty to yourself. 
   
One does not always consider what it is they would like to leave upon the earth during their life’s journey. For you are all aware of the transient nature of the earth life but of the eternal nature of Divine Love. So those blessings you leave that touch the souls of those you encounter, I tell you that you will be most grateful for those gifts because they continue to bless those who receive them. Gifts of the spirit touch on eternity and the gift of God’s Love connects every soul to life eternal and immortality, as you know, or at least as you have been informed. The more you open to receiving God’s Love, the more His Essence is felt in a very real and substantial way; a bit of eternity now residing in your souls. How wonderful is that! Why settle for less than true happiness, in God’s Love and Grace. 
   
You will never regret your times in prayer. What Judas and Clare wish me to tell you, and as my dear brother and beloved was hearing yesterday,<sup>1</sup> is that when we tell you again and again and again, to pray, pray, and pray, and still more, we want you to understand that this is not what the world might perceive as a proper prayer - an orthodox incantation of words that as we like to say, reach no higher than the lips. Your prayer can be one moment of wanting to connect to God, one moment of longing to feel the Love of your Creator, one moment of humbleness and openness is all it takes. So, what we are really encouraging you to do is to add as many of these soul moments during your day, however busy, of going to that longing. And as each one of you knows, when you speak in truth, when you share a kindness, a smile, your heart is lifted, and as we have told you, the giver receives more than the recipient. So, my beloved friends, you can never give too much as you will always receive more.
    
Be in peace, be in joy, be in God’s Love, the greatest gift in all the world! 
  
We all send our love and blessings to you dear and beautiful kind souls. Poor as church mice and yet rich Rockefeller in God’s Love. I love you, truly I do. Go in God’s Love and peace. I am Care.
