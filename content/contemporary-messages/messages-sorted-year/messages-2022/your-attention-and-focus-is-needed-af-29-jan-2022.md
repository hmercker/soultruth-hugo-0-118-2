Greetings to you, my friends, I am Professor Salyards. I am glad to see you coming together, exchanging your ideas, supporting one another in the work that you have done thus far and the intention to place more focus on your endeavors so that you may become more public in your work and efforts. It is time to draw the curtains aside and to bring in the gaze of your friends, those who are interested in what you are doing, encouraging the opening of doors and opportunities for collaboration that you may all work together to help awaken humanity to the light and truth of God's Love, to the potentials of each individual soul, and the choices that God has placed before each soul.

There is much to teach your fellow human beings for a great deal of ignorance and many misconceptions abide in your world. It is our hope that you will all put some effort and time into teaching the truth in its simplicity and power so as to awaken others to the great gifts that God has to give to them. The beautiful Love that is available to each soul and the awakening of humanity which must come on the heels of Love and blessings from God. There is still much to do, my friends, still many avenues to pursue, still many souls to draw to you to help make this a vital and beautiful family of Light, light bringers all, on the journey of service to humanity, reflecting the Will of God, the Love of God, the Truth of God.
You will find your way and you have found your way. Much more is coming and it is my hope that you will put your gaze upon this work and apply yourselves with diligence and joy. The desire to serve and to make this your dedication to God, your loving service to your brothers and sisters. God needs you to be of service and we need your attention and focus so that we all may do our work in a way that brings the attention of others, and ignites a desire of others, opening doors to others who are awaiting this opportunity to share their light in this circle, this family of Love.

So much hinges upon your choices for we cannot interfere with your free will. I know that the world offers many distractions and challenges. Yet, do you not feel the rightness, the comfort and the joy that comes when you engage in such service willingly and freely? How God indeed blesses all of His children who desire to serve in love, how you are uplifted, how you have set aside some time in devotion to service, in devotion to those seeking souls who are in need of truth, upliftment, comfort, love. These things you may readily give provided you are within the flow of God's Will and Love. These things come in waves and outpourings and opportunities set before you by God's mighty Hand upon you.

My beloved friends, may you find your way through the threshold, this doorway that God presents to you, may you find fulfillment and joy in your service to God. It will come in surprising ways, but it can only come when your gaze is set upon the desire to serve, to be at the ready for God's Will to be enacted through you. Seek to be God's instruments and channels of light. Seek His Love to flow into your souls often and seek with humility those opportunities that God places before you to speak truth, to serve in love, to see and gaze upon the simple act that is God's Will as He places you on the road of service and love.

Blessings to you, my friends, blessings as we continue on this beautiful journey together. I am Professor Salyards. Know that I work closely with you all. My love is with you. God bless you, God bless you all.
