Orion received by Elizabeth Mack

I am your friend, Orion. I wish to congratulate you on your work thus far. You have joined together as a group and honored the Father by bringing your love and joy into the world. We are here to help you, but we need you to be open to us. We shall come soon and help our brothers and sisters to learn more about the state of affairs between people and countries. For it is only with God’s Love that you all will survive. We bring you love and the Father’s grace to protect you during these tumultuous times to come.

Pray, my dear children, that you will be encapsulated within a bubble of love. For the next few days you will know how precious you are to all of us who live within the Father’s Will and grace. You may continue. Yes, it is faith that will bring you through all that will be coming and love to protect you. I am still here. We have enjoyed traveling with you and will continue to do so.
