I am St. George, and you asked for me to come, and so I am here.  I really wish to say that I approve of what you are doing to enhance and to uplift your nation and communities for this nation is in great need of upliftment, of understanding of things that are of the heart, and the moral grounding so that you may live together in harmony and peace. 
 
It is important that every individual makes an effort to step beyond their apathy, to awaken from the slumbers, to be active agents of light in this world. For how else can the world change without those individuals who are willing to step forward and willing to step beyond themselves to something higher and greater, to truly be a beacon of light in the world?

Many sleep or they look for distractions and material gain. They look to hide away from themselves by being who they think they should be, by competing with others for what is available in the material sense. This is folly, my friends, for you have a very well-known saying, which is very true, that you cannot take it with you. This time upon your earth is short but it is important, crucial to the next steps in your life for what you do here has great affect upon who you are and where you may be in the world beyond. 

Consider this my friends that your thoughts and actions, your motivations, all that you do will be reflected in the next step of life.  If you live a life that is so common these days and lacks integrity and love, and acknowledgment for one another, service to one another, then you will find yourself in those places of greyness and darkness in the world beyond. For this is what you have earned. It is law: *"What you sow you shall reap."*  

It is not that God wishes to punish the individual, but when that individual is not taught from an early age how to conduct themselves in concert and harmony with others, how to look upon our beloved God, how to be in the world to serve and uplift each other, then there is great ignorance. The individual has wasted an opportunity to grow and be strong in light, to truly be what God intends.

So I urge you all to grasp each day as a gift from God, and to ask the question: *“What might I do today to bring greater light to myself and to the world, to serve another, to love another, to be a light?”* And when this nation and this world steps forward in this way, seeking to serve one another, bringing love forward, then indeed it will be a world worth living in, a beautiful world.

May you work towards these ends, my friends. Find your way to God, I urge you, find your way to God, and in this way you will be guided and awakened so that you may truly serve, you may truly be God's servants and be effective in changing the world.

Thank you for listening to me. I am George, and I am happy to return to this place. Of course, where I dwell I am not a king. I am not a saint. I am but another soul of God, who seeks to serve and to be a servant. May God bless you, my friends, and bring you courage, for you all need courage to step forward against the flow of life, which is contrary to this. Courage comes from God, and with courage will come love, abundant and beautiful. God bless you and keep you in love.
