September 4<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mary Magdalene received by Al Fike

Dear beloveds, I am Mary Magdalene, as I am known to you. I bring the Lamp of Truth into your midst, carrying the Love of God which is resplendent in Truth. It glows and uplifts you within your soul. For when you know your own soul, and you forge your connection with your Creator and seek His Love, His Essence, so Truth shall come to you. Not in your machinations of the mind, but in the understanding of your soul. For it is there that Truth resides and shall reside for all eternity, beloveds, as you grow in Godâ€™s Love.

I carry the Lamp of Truth for you as a gift. May you come to know the power of this gift, which is that which will open the faculties and abilities of your soul, provided you seek the great gift from God, which has the power to do so. I come to you in love, for I am your sister in love and truth, and I am with you, beloveds, in your journey. God bless you. I am Mary. I am your friend. I am with you in love and I bless you in truth. God bless you. God bless you.
