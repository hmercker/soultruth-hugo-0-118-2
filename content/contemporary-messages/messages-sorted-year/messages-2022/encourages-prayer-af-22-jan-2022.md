May the Father’s Love continue to awaken you, my friends, open you up to new vistas, visions, experiences and awakenings so that your gifts may flourish, that the true wisdom of your soul may awaken, and that all may be within the flow, that mighty river of God’s Love that shall carry us all forward in service, in awakening, in development, in joy. 

The energetic and psychic conditions of your world ebb and flow like your weather. At times, you experience an extreme that is difficult and makes for you a challenge in your day. At other times you feel the flow of God and His Love close and you are uplifted and carried. You know these extremes well and you often try to fortify yourselves from those conditions that are difficult. Indeed, as you go to prayer and ask God to protect you and uplift you, so you open the doors and excite the laws which will bring to you relief and protection. As your world continues to be challenged and extreme energies continue to exert themselves, you must make greater effort to go to God, to seek out His blessing of Light and Love. For it is in these underpinnings, this beautiful practice of love and prayer, that you are not too susceptible to the buffeting winds of the human condition and the changing energies of your Earth. 

You must learn to ground yourselves in love, always, even when you are engaged in material practice and effort. That love must be your strength, must envelop you and bring grace to all that you do. This would be an almost impossible challenge to those who are not bolstered by the power of the Love of God within their souls, but for you, it remains a difficult challenge but not impossible. To walk in this grace always is ideal, and as you continue to shed your humanity and become something born in love, then it becomes easier. 

Though your vision and perceptions may grow acute and you may see all around you the devastating conditions which humanity continues to nurture and enfold within the lives of many, many souls, rather than judgment and fear, you will feel compassion and love. These things will be awakened within you, helping you to see beyond those human conditions to the value and beauty of the soul, and in this vision of truth, you will be used as God’s channels of love for many, bringing comfort and peace to many, healing and upliftment to many. 

Unfortunately, as long as you continue to cling on to this human condition of your own personal making and expression, the power and clarity of this channel will be restricted by these aspects within you. Though you cannot force and command the expulsion of these conditions, because it is a mental effort designed to manipulate the material world, rather, you must go in faith to your Heavenly Father and seek His blessing of Love, the healing of which will help you to release these conditions. It comes in a flow and a timing that is determined by the strength of your own soul willing to expand into those areas within you that have been hollowed out by healing and must be infilled with love.

It takes time, application and effort in prayer to truly travel this road of expiation and healing. It takes effort to discipline your mind and the patterns of your thoughts so that you may not invite further conditions within you. It is the new world manifest through you, and this is something that we seek to nurture and assist you so that it may truly be so, and you find your liberation, your freedom, your joy, in the remaking of your being in love. 

This journey is day by day, moment by moment, and each has its particular blessings and challenges, but you move forward, my beautiful friends. Each day we see a little more light shining within you, a little more insight rising forth to your consciousness. Indeed, you must go to God for the strength to continue this effort, the power of His Love to ignite this healing, the flow of His Grace and His guidance so that your vision may be kept upon this path forward, ever forward. 

Beloved souls, you are in the Grace of God. Your souls revel in His Love. His Will continues to manifest through you in whatever way is possible. So the difficult part is done. That great challenge that humanity has to capitulate to the truth rather than be independent and self-empowered and living a life that is devoid of God is the great challenge of your brothers and sisters the world over. For them to see beyond the blindness and the ignorance that they carry so vehemently within their minds and their will, you must step forward and draw them to you with the charisma of the soul, the power of love. For despite their condition and their willfulness, each has a soul yearning for God. Each is in pain and isolation and yearns to be loved. 

Though they put in much effort to distract themselves from this true condition that is very deep within them, there are inklings and fleeting moments for each of these children to be in the grace of God and know that there is something more than that which is their own reality and aloneness. You have one another, beloved souls, and you have many others who join you on this journey. How blessed you are, how truly blessed you are, to gaze within the hearts, the eyes of your brothers and sisters and say, *“Yes, I understand. I too, join you in this great quest. I too have experienced the Love of God.”* This makes for a powerful acknowledgement, something that is important to see and know in your relationships with others. For it is within this power, unity and fellowship that much can be accomplished and harmony may unfold. 

Gaze upon your brothers and sisters who are not blessed as you have been blessed, with great compassion and love, realising that they are bereft of the great treasure of the soul and the great gift of fellowship that you share, that you may embrace them and bring them into the warmth, the fire of God’s Love, that they too may find what you have found, experience what you have experienced. God yearns for them to come close. God yearns for you to show them the way. Seek to be used as His instruments each and every day and join in prayer when the invitation is offered to whomever wishes to do so. You will find great fulfilment in this, a great satisfaction and joy within your hearts. 

Continue on, my beloved and beautiful friends. We have much work to do and little time to do it in. May we all find our way to that beautiful freedom that comes with the release of all conditions that are not of love. You are closer than you think, and you will find that ecstatic joy, and in this wonderment you will raise your eyes to God and say, *“Thank you, thank you beloved Creator, for creating me and showing me the way to greater life, life eternal, glorious life.”* 

Thank you beloved souls, we are with you upon that journey. We love you. I am Orion. Blessings to you, all and the universe of Truth, Love, Light and all that comes with these wonderful things that God has created for His children. God bless you.
