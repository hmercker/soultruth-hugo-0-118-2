I am Moses. I come to encourage you and to uphold you upon your path, the path of service, light and love that is of your choosing and of your decision to follow the Will of God. Beautiful souls, continue to awaken in the great gift of His love.

It took hundreds of years for me to know this Love, for it was not available to me in the time that I existed on Earth until our dear and beloved brother came to open the door to its gift. How fortunate you are to know this in your daily life upon the earthly plane, and to truly live this and be a part of the great unfolding Truth that is the Father’s Love for all His children. You are given a great gift. I urge you to make the most of this gift, to seek its blessings, its transformation, its awakening, for it is the highest gift of all, this Divine Essence infilling your soul. It will transform you, my beloved friends, and it has the potential to transform the world. 
May you come to fully embrace this truth, to make it a part of your every thought and breath and deed, that your prayers are constant, that your awakening opens fully and completely to God. You are His children, and God continues to guide you upon the path of light and love and truth. May you continue to put aside all distractions, all that which is not in harmony with love, and be fully awakened in this truth. For the power of this Love not only is able to transform you, but also use you as a transformational instrument of God to bring the Truth of His Love to humanity. As I did in my day, so you must do in yours: to follow the guidance of God and to have the unwavering faith of a soul who is truly in alignment with God. In this way, God will guide you and use you as His instruments. 

You will know wondrous things in your life. You will see the unfolding of God’s intention and plan for humanity, and it shall come alive within you and in your life. My beloved friends, be truly in alignment with your Creator, with your soul, so that your consciousness may be in harmony with the truth, that you may know all that you can know and you may be all that you can be in the harmony of love. 

I walk with you, as are many angels. We surround you. We are with you and we shall never leave you, as it is a constant vigil. The angelic forces gather around you in order to uphold and protect, to inspire and to love, so that you may truly be in alignment with God, and all the conditions of this world may not touch you or draw you away, that you may truly be in alignment and harmony with God. 

Beloved souls, be in the peace that passes all understanding. Know the great joy that is the soul awakened in love. Carry the light of truth with you and uphold your commitment, your journey, and do not waver but be true to your soul and true to God’s Will. You will find yourself upon a wondrous journey, beyond your imaginings, awakening to all the wonders of God, all the beauty of God, all the grace of God, as His Love becomes your foundation, your light, and your truth. 

God bless you, my friends. I am Moses, and I come to encourage you and tell you that no matter what the journey, provided you are committed to truth and love, you shall indeed overcome and find your way toward greater harmony. May God bless you, my friends. May God truly bless your soul, awakening you, awakening you. God bless you. God’s Love to you all. God bless you.
