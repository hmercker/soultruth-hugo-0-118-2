Jesus received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I come, I am Jesus, with you once more in prayer. My prayer for you is that your souls may continue to open and flourish in the gift of the Father's Essence that is intended to flow in and heal, uplift and transform each of you, within every part of you, that you may truly be God’s children, walking in the Light of His Love.

Though the world conspires to draw you away from God, I say to you, make your efforts in prayer, make great efforts in thought and deed, and all those things that bring you close to God. For now is the time when that relationship, the power of it, the wonderment of it, will sustain you in this world like nothing other will do. It is the power of God's Touch upon you that will provide the ways and the means, the guidance and the avenues for you to be in light and to be channel of light in the world. You must endeavor with great sincerity and effort to open those passages between your soul and God’s Soul.

I know that you struggle, my beloved brothers and sisters. I know that this life continues to put before you great challenges and tries to block the way for your continued growth and awakening in light. May you find your way in love, in faith, that the strength of your soul may override all that is within you that is a part of the earthly condition, that you may continue to release those conditions that are not in harmony with love.

It is an act of faith to walk with God, to trust in your Heavenly Father, to be in alignment with all that which is of your Heavenly Father. Release those thoughts and conditions that only create disharmony within you and around you. Seek your alignment with God. This simple way will bring what you desire, will bring the joy in your heart, blossoming and flowing forth, will help you to see beyond the human condition and intellect to that place of the freedom of the soul, the truth of the soul, the expression of the soul.

It is the new way, beloveds, and it is easy for you to indulge in those old patterns and ways of being in the world that draw you in, that try to enmesh you in the darkness of fear and judgment, turmoil, but you must be in the world but not of the world, beloved souls. For, how else can God express His blessings through you than when you are in the condition of light and joy?

You must step forward in light, beloved souls, be strong in light and love. Walk beyond those temptations and find the freedom that comes with your heartfelt and sincere relationship with God. In this way, the doors will open, the avenue will be clear, and you will not be burdened, beloved souls, but find the joy in this true and steadfast relationship with your Creator. Release the burdens, beloveds, and know the joy and expansiveness of God, His Essence alive within you, His Truth shining forth in every part and aspect of your being.

May God bless, my beloved souls, and keep you upon this path, never to waiver, your feet secure upon the path that God has set before you. Allow the worries and cares of this world to fall away, and know the peace that passes all understanding, beloveds.

God bless you. I am with you. Know this, that I am with you, that many angels walk with you as well, upon a path of light and enlightenment. It comes with every step. It is yours, not beyond your grasp, but within your grasp. Embrace the truth, beloveds, and release all that is of error. We are with you in love, always. God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you.
