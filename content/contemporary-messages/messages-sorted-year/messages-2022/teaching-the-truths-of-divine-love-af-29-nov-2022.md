# Vulnerabilities of Interpreting and Teaching the Truths of Divine Love

Received by Al Fike   


I am Augustine. You have some concerns about those who wish to interpret and teach these truths in their own way and means. This is a valid concern because often when there are those who splinter off from the mainstream and gain a following or attention by their efforts and their gifts, then the true message is vulnerable and could be lost. Yet, there are those of you who are the stalwarts of truth who continue to be loyal to the clear and simple teaching of Divine Love and that which our beloved Master gave through various sources and taught when he lived upon the Earth. This is the way of the world, my friends. We cannot circumvent the free will of individuals. We can only teach truth and hope that they, the student, may follow their guidance and inclinations of the soul more so than their minds and those inclinations. It is a great challenge for every soul upon the Earth to come to reconcile their consciousness with their own soul and with God.

Yet many follow these teachings in their own way and their own interpretation and find their way towards God. There are some who are greatly inspired and put their own interpretations upon these teachings, adding, subtracting, and molding it into something that is more compatible with their ideas and mindful reckonings. This is inevitable for none of you have the clear and perfect truth, unadorned by your mind. Yet some of you are closer to that ideal and that clarity than others. This is why we continue to encourage you to seek the development and opening of your soul with Divine Love, thereby opening the channels and doors to this clarity for it is only when the soul is well-developed, the faculties of the soul are awakened and clear and pronounced within your consciousness that truth as we know it can be received and understood. 

Even in this case, the great challenge is to communicate this understanding to others, for the understandings of the soul, the inclinations and perspectives of the soul are quite different from that of the mind. Thus, you are greatly vexed by these differences and challenged by them since you live in a material world that is indeed very focused upon the material mind and its aptitudes and reasonings.

My only suggestion to you, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, is that you continue to pray to receive the great gift of Divine Love, in so doing, be an example of the truth, speak it as best you can, and do so with humility. In this way, you become a true teacher, a beautiful channel for God. Do not judge another but realize that you are all upon this plane that is so contrary to love and to the truth. The very fact that you have overcome these fundamental barriers in your world is a great testimony to the power of truth and the power of God’s Love within your soul.

Indeed, you will refine your understanding. You will come to see more clearly. The faculties of your soul will point you in the direction of truth as you continue to grow and expand in Love, to have faith in this and have faith in your brothers and sisters that they too will take this journey and find their way. Indeed there are those who are obstinate and insist upon a certain road to take that is a reflection of their minds’ ambitions. But even they will come to the realization of the truth that will transform their thinking and their intentions. It must be, for the power of truth, the power of love, the power of the light within your soul will insist upon those who are true to these things to be predominant and to be the guiding light and source of their efforts, their instrumentality, and their teachings. They cannot stray far unless they willingly resist and intend to go their own way without listening to the Will of God and honouring the Will of God. This, of course, can be the case, for God honours free will as do we. But in most cases, their resistance if futile because the longings and yearnings of the soul are more powerful than that of the mind. They will find their way accordingly.

Pray for all of your brothers and sisters. Pray to be used as channels of love for them and for all. Have faith in the Will and plan of God to bring all of His children into alignment with truth. That interpretation of truth, the experience of truth, the expression of truth will be unique for each individual. That must be honoured by all with love, humility, grace, and peace. May you come to embrace your brothers and sisters and leave behind your mental concerns, your hesitancy. Even if this hestitancy comes from soul perception, you must be mature and deal with this in a way that is harmonious and loving for God is guiding all. Each individual will follow the road of their choosing, of their desire, a reflection of their efforts to truth.

So it will be. So it is, has been, and will be forever. It is the way of God’s universe. His Laws, His Laws of Love all respect the great gift of free will. All respect the wondrous gifts that He has given His children. Whether that be of the mind, the spirit, or the soul, these things in time will all merge as one and be truly in alignment with God as you continue to grow in God’s Love and know His purpose, His intention for each one of you. Listen. Be in alignment with God, attuned to your soul, and seek His Love. All else will come in accordance to your efforts and desires.

God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine. My love is with you. My love is with you all, beloveds. May God’s Love be the anchor point and foundation for everything in your lives. God bless you, beloveds.
