# The Angels' Perspective of Time

Matthew received by Al Fike

I am Matthew. You all feel the ebb and flow of time upon your earthly existence. It governs so much in your life and in your thinking. Many of you feel as if the efforts that you make are not equal to the time that you have upon this earthly plane. Some of you feel as if you are losing opportunities and that doors are closing for you. So, there is great concern for time. Those of you who are advancing in years often feel as if your work is closing as that door in life closes.

Yet, the truth of the matter is that time as you perceive it is of no consequence. It is only God’s timing that is important. God’s timing is a reflection of God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. So, you trod upon the Earth minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour, day-by-day thinking that all you are accomplishing is that which is your daily routines and efforts or to live a life upon the Earth plane.

But in truth, on other levels or dimension of consciousness, you are indeed very active and working diligently in concert with God’s plan, that you must take this into account, my beloved and beautiful friends. There is much going on in the background, much activity, a great flurry of interaction and expression of thought, deed, desire, mindful intentions, and soulful intentions. What you see in a conscious way is merely scratching the surface of what is truly unfolding in God’s plan.

So, I wish for you not be discouraged or frustrated or anxious but to walk in faith and know as you continue to grow in the consciousness of God’s Love awakening within your soul to this reality and truth, you will find that that which I speak of will be more evident and tangible in your life.

Yes, there is always much to do and more to do and greater effort to be made. This you have no doubt or confusion. But indeed, I wish for you not to think that you are wasting your time or biding your time away or walking in the direction that God has not intended for you, for none of these things are true. If you wish to be conscious of the efforts that are being made through you by God to your brothers and sisters, then you must shift your consciousness from the daily concerns of the material life to a more spiritual awareness.

This takes great effort to shift your consciousness toward these others levels of awareness and being. It is not easily accomplished when you are so fully engaged in a daily life and routines that are much more a part of the material world than that of the spirit. It is understandable that you have challenges in this regard. But if you are truly to be attuned to God’s Will and to walk in the Light of God’s reality, His Love, then there must be an accommodation within your conscious self to allow this to flow readily washing over your material perspective, engulfing it in something higher and more beautiful.

But indeed, as you are well aware, it is reliant upon your free will and your conscious efforts. Where you direct your consciousness, where you place your desire, where you lead yourself in conscious awareness and effort will determine these things. We can only point the way. We can help you remove those barriers toward these conscious and beautiful awarenesses.

Often, you compare yourselves to others and think their example and expression in these regards is what you must aim for and cultivate. Yet, each individual will have their own unique experiences reflecting their own unique gifts. So, your expectations must lean toward self-awareness and compassion and love. Patience, beloved souls, trust and faith, these things are the underpinnings of this journey.

As you pray for more of the Divine Love to enter your souls, so you empower your gifts which in time will come forward into your conscious self. For some, it is more readily available, open to your conscious awareness. For others, it is a great struggle. Yet, you are all being guided, uplifted, blessed. Many things manifest through you that you are not so aware of.

The journey seems slow to you because of the passing of time but we see it as quick. The speed is remarkable in regards to your awakening and unfolding of your gifts, your soul. So, as you look back upon your lives, a very short period upon the earthly plane, do you not see tremendous growth, progress, that indeed the awakening is taking place, that you are walking upon an accelerated path of soul awakening that will continue to accelerate, my beautiful friends? You will continue to see more clearly. That which starts out as an inkling of awareness will grow and blossom into something beautiful with depth and intensity and breadth which will astound you.

The coming year will bring you many blessings, my beloved friends. Be ready. Be eager. Do not be discouraged but put forth your joy and gratitude toward God for God orchestrates your journey in the most beautiful way. Provided you are willing to step forward, so the gifts flood upon you, are absorbed within you, and expressed through you. Beloved souls, truly desire to be God’s instruments in the world. If this desire is first and foremost in your thoughts, in your efforts to serve, then indeed, what will unfold will be remarkable. You are His children. You have been claimed and you shall walk the journey that leads toward the redeemed soul, find yourself releasing those conditions that are not part of this journey and not part of love.

May God bless you, my friends. I am Matthew. My love for you is great. I love you dearly. We all walk together. Indeed, time passes but indeed, the journey unfolds. God bless you, beloved souls. Matthew loves you. God bless you.
