# Instructions for Work Ahead

April 11<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Soul Awakening Tour, Barbados

Bartholomew received by Al Fike

I am Bartholomew and yes, dear brother, I am your guide. I come once again to reassure you all that there is a plan and that we are busy preparing each of you for your role and your place within that plan. For our ears are to God and God directs us and guides us forward in these great preparatory times for the unfolding of a plan that is so immense in scope and powerful in its nature that we are all swept into the flow of His Will and will come to know His Will with each breath though we do not breathe. Indeed, each moment we are eager to serve God. So, we encourage you to do the same, dear brethren.

Prayer is very important, and I know that we have stressed this many, many times. But it is the key to what is to come. For you must learn to pray in all conditions, in all circumstances. You must come to our Heavenly Father and seek His counsel and seek His blessings. Without this connection, true and clear between you and God, you will be lost in the tumult that is to come. You must have this secure communication and relationship in order to move in the world as His channel to be protected and safe, to ensure that your part within the great plan is expressed clearly. For each of you has a role to play, and there are others whom we are drawing in, who will also play their role.

For even though there will be much change and difficulties, the outcomes of this great shift upon the world will be harmonious. There will be peace. Each of you will come to see the world differently. Your perceptions will shift along with the great change that comes. Your priorities will be different. Your perspective will be that of the soul and the soul’s wisdom and perception of life. You will be different. What you desire will be different. You will not lose yourself in this great shift of consciousness. How you respond and will respond to the world will be more in harmony with God’s Will and the direction in which God is leading His children.

Beloved souls, you will see much in the coming times. There is much you will need to release. Your desires and addictions, as you call them, will fall away. In their place will come a knowing and a clarity, a strength, a soul wisdom and an outflowing of love through you, so that what is a normal day in your life will be very different from what it is today. There is much work for you to do. I urge you, each of you, to continue to reach out to your brothers and sisters. As you are well aware, many will turn away. Many have and insist upon their particular perspectives and ideas. Many follow the road of the natural man and the perspective of that road. I say to you that God is preparing the way for you to have and to fulfil the plan, that part within you that will reach out to those souls who are truly in alignment or at the very least, desire to be in alignment with the truth of God’s Love.

You have together in these times, a wonderful opportunity to be bonded in love, to enjoy one another’s company, to express yourselves to one another, to be in that place of fellowship and peace together. Utilise these opportunities as best as you can, my beloved friends. For you do not know what comes in the future and, as you witness the changes, you will derive some comfort from your memories together and you will have a bond together, soul to soul which God will utilise to uphold you all and the many who are connected to you.

Be of good cheer. Feel the joy within your soul. Feel the beauty that is all around you in God’s creation, expressing themselves and the pleasure of it, the joy of it, my beloved friends. May God’s peace and great inflowing of His Essence continue to uphold you, transform you and keep you in the blessing, the peace, the joy and the light that is meant for each of you. Beloved souls, you are truly blessed and will come to realise how truly blessed you are as your eyes open, as your consciousness shifts to that of the soul and you see life differently and live life differently. It is and shall be the great blessing of God that you will truly become His children and be truly blessed in this sacred relationship between you and God.

Cling together, my beloved friends. Cling together and know the comfort that each brings, the beauty of the soul that each carries, the truth that you share together, the bond of love that is powerful and immutable and shall be with you for all eternity. God bless you. I am Bartholomew and I am happy to be with you today, beloved souls. Blessings to you all in love. In love we come and in love we urge you to express it to all in your world. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
