May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am with you, my precious and beloved souls, brothers and sisters on the Path Divine, beautiful lights in the world. You are my brothers and sisters, for you know the great gift that has transformed my soul and is transforming your soul.

I am Jesus and I come to bless you, beloveds, bless you on the way to at-onement with God. Bless you upon this journey of life in the material world that will someday be transformed into the spirit, and then again transformed into the Celestial Spheres of life.

This journey, beloveds souls, may it be blessed, may it be blessed with love, the great Love of God, awakening every part of you, every aspect of your soul, everything within and around you, transformed with Love, the great Essence of God, touching you so deeply and profoundly that you are changed forever.

Beloveds, I am with you, I am with you. In this journey upon this path, I am with you, beloved souls. God bless you, and know that I am close and shall always be so. For, he and she who journeys upon a path of love benefits from the presence of the angels and the blessings of God upon their soul. All comes to those who seek for the highest gift, the blessing of God that is of His Soul to your soul. We are together upon this path and shall ever be more, brothers and sisters, in this great family of love. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you. My love is with you always. God bless you.
