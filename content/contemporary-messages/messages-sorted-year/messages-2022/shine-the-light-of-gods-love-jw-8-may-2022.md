I am here Amon the first mother of humankind and long a redeemed soul in the Father’s Celestial kingdom. I greet you on this Mother’s Day with all the love in my soul as each one of you has had soul awakening, your perceptions extending beyond what is considered the normal range into the realms of spirit and influenced by the Divine Love. 

You may know that the physical world, the natural world, is alive. There is nothing that is not living and every living being is interconnected. So, the actions of humans, will always have some kind of effect, on other humans, on the planet, and consider, on the atmosphere as well. For in the Celestial realms our thought forms can be seen, and we are all in the harmony of God’s laws and love, this not being the case on the earth plane. However, you who have had an awakening of your soul connecting you on the earth the Celestial realms on the path of prayer and the bridge of God’s love, you are sensitive to these thought forms and what you send out. 
  
As you allow your souls to take precedence over all the chatter , all the darkness, alll the chaos, and the troubles of your world you do indeed bring a light. Picture shining a flashlight into a deep well where the creatures there begin to scatter because they cannot tolerate the light. When you shine your light, the light of God’s love from your soul, you penetrate the darkness, and you are lifted above the troubles and the chatter and the politics. And this harmony extends to the physical world and the natural ecosystems on earth where you not only realize the interconnectedness and interdependency of all creatures, but the wonderful influence of the Divine Love upon the natural world. Let yourselves be in harmony in both worlds as the love of God from Celestial kingdom from the fountainhead of our Heavenly Father comes into your souls. Reach out to the world, be kind to Mother Earth that you may walk into a new world of harmony and sustainability but above all, of soul awakening.
   
May the love of God be with each of you on this Mother’s Day and always. From Mother Mary and myself, and all here who love you so deeply, so dearly, know that we support you, we embrace you. Have no fear as you walk in the grace of God’s love in faith, in trust, in joy.
 
I shall step back and join you in your lattice of light each one of you being blessed as we send out the blessing of God’s love to the world. May God bless you and keep you.  I am Amon. Go in Peace.
