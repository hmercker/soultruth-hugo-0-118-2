It is I Care. I come to assure you that protection to whatever extent we can provide is given. And most assuredly to Al and Jeanne on their travels as they spread the truths of Divine Love and go in prayer with those souls who come to them. To whatever extent you can reach out to the world it is encouraged because each of you has the light of truth in your soul and have been given the great gift of the Fathers love. I ask you to not allow yourselves to be wrapped up in the everyday drama of negativity of the world, but rather, to allow God to wrap you in His Love that you be part of the solution, for you are the harbingers of a new age. 

There are many, who wishing to progress spiritually, partake in such things as exercise, fasting, meditation, perhaps chanting and so forth. This we encourage because it helps to calm the body, calm the mind, stabilize the emotions, and bring one to a place that if they so desire to open to Godâ€™s love, they are a fitting vessel. That said, I wish you to consider this: Fasting from the drama, turning it off and turning on your love light. Turning to prayer and walking away from the darkness and negativity or, walking into it, shining your light, speaking the truth, and blessing all as you have been blessed.
 
I ask you to never think of us as being far away because we respond to your intentions and when you send up a prayer to our loving Creator, God responds to your soul through His Holy Spirit. We respond to your needs, your soul requests on the material plane, and we always encourage, we always seek to inspire. This is what you do when you share your stories to a world so in need of light. 
  
So, take heart my dear friends. Hope that all awaken in the love of God. Allow this love to permeate your being as you open your hearts and your souls to it that God may bless you in endless love. I am your sister in Christ and your eternal friend, and I thank you. I am Care. May God bless you.
