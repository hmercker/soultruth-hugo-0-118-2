# Working Behind the Scenes

April 21<sup>st</sup>, 2022

Soul Awakening Tour, Holland America Cruise

Anna received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Anna, grandmother of Jesus who is with us throughout this trip, nudging souls towards us so we can express our love towards them, Keep open, stay open. There are many more whose souls we are to touch. This is  gift of touching souls behind the scenes and we are with all of you in this endeavor. For God has sent us here to do that during this voyage, to touch many souls who will come forward. Be assured. They will join us and they will venture to their own lands and touch others. For this is the way God has planned it. Unity, it is about unity of soul. Do you see? We know you have felt it when you pray, you feel it with those you know but also those you do not know. You are joined by the Love of the Father. Thank you for letting me speak.
