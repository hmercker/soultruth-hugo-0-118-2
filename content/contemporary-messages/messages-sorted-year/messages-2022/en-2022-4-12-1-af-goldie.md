# We All Receive Guidance, Aware of it or Not

April 12<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Soul Awakening Tour, Barbados

Goldie received by Al Fike

So often you believe that you do not hear the word of God nor the guidance that is given. But I am here to tell you that more often than you think we are whispering in your ears and bringing the guidance, oh so subtlety so that you may think that you have developed an idea and a thought but no, my friends, you are merely receiving the guidance that you have prayed for. But often it does not come in ways that you think are required and necessary. You wish it to come with the clanging of a bell and light bulbs flickering and all manner of signals and blessings to herald God's guidance for you. But I tell you, it is a whisper, an inclination, an inspiration that will come with God's touch of Love upon you. Know that God's sweet touch is gentle, is filled with Love, and beckons you forward so that you may stumble forward with the gentle push of God. But it is what is meant to be. It is a beautiful wind and breath of God to guide you along your way. Open yourselves, my beloved friends, to these inspirations and loving impulses and guidance. And so that which holds you from this will continue to fall away and the whisper will become a clear and resounding voice so that you will know undoubtedly what is meant and what shall come.

May the Love of God continue to open the way to your understanding, to your hearing, to your beautiful selves. Your souls are pulsing with Love, with light, so eager to find its expression and way within you and through you for as God's pulse of Love continues to touch your soul so this beat comes together resonating and synchronizing until God and you will become one, one together, one in Love, one in light. Feel the pulsations of your soul, its response to God's touch. Feel the joy that comes with this and the loving intentions that God has for each of you and the gifts and blessings that He pours upon you every moment. Even though you may not know and feel and hear, it still pours, it still pours upon each of you and on all those who are receptive. Oh, how you are truly loved and how beautiful, my beloved friends. I am Goldie and I am with you and I bring joy to your hearts, uplifting you. Especially when you are feeling the burdens of life I come to unburden and uplift.  Laughter and joy, my friends, are so important in life. Continue to cultivate these things within you and be joyful.

May God bless you, may His Love continue to do its magic within your soul. I love you. I love each and every one of you and I come close to assist you. God bless you, I am Goldie, I love you.
