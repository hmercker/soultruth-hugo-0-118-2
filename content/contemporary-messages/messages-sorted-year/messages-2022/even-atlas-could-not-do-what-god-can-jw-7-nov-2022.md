# Even Atlas could not do what God can

My dear friends It is I your brother Charles or as you know me, Charlie. I come to invite you to the dance for this was my forte. And as I have said before and as you may have seen in my films, I could dance around negativity; I could pinch it in the butt. There was much joy in my expression of dance and freedom. 

So, I say to you as this world that you live in goes through this transitional period where it is so easy to get pulled into negativity, to be reacting as you say, out of sorts (to rage). If you can maintain your connection with love and more importantly God’s love and remain in that joy you feel in your soul, your heart glowing when confronted with something that is less than happy, less than light, you can do a dance. And of course, you don’t have to take this literally but if you feel like dancing taking a few steps here and there, then by all means, do so. This in itself will bring a smile to even the most out of sorts.
 
You have this beautiful love in your souls, you awaken with it in the morning as you attempt to stay in harmony. So be mindful of your connection in prayer in song in dance, in peace that allows the infilling of the Creator’s love that lifts you up to in turn, lift the world up. Even Atlas could not  do what God’s love can. So, smile and share your heart and  even if it’s breaking let it break open that God may fill it with the beautiful grace and blessings of His love for you. 

I thank you for this time and allowing me to come through. I am your brother on the path of Divine Love and I shall always be there for you if you should call. My love to each one. May God bless you. I am Charlie, Charlie Chaplin.
