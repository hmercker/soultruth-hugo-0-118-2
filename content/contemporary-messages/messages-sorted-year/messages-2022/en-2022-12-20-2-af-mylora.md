# Open Your Souls to Receive God’s Love

December 20<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

I bring a blessing and a healing. I am Mylora. I come to you with heartfelt desire to see you all be in the light, to feel the light, to know the light, to truly be a light in the world. You know well how you might be this light, how you may open yourselves to the great light of God’s Soul, His Love shining through, touching you, making you that beautiful expression, glowing, lighting the way for others as His Love continues to transform you, my beloved friends.

May you be an instrument in the world to bring change that will bring harmony that unfolds in the loving grace of God. May you know His deep peace, peace beyond understanding. May you know His gentle Touch bringing you comfort and upliftment. May your soul open wide to receive the gift that He has for you, a gift that never ends, a gift that is always available to you at any moment, any breath. In that breath, may you ask God to receive His gift of Love. For it is in this benediction, this commitment to achieve a powerful bond together, you and God, that the transformation might take place, that the light may grow, that you may be that truly magnificent creature of God, His Love making you a redeemed soul, His Love opening up all your gifts, all those wondrous things within that are just waiting to be expressed and awakened in love.

We pray for this together, that all that we are and all that we can be will be realised in the Father’s Love, and that indeed we walk the path that Jesus has tread for us. We walk the path of truth and He shows the way and God lights the way until we are firmly in God’s embrace, until we are truly at-one with God. My beloveds, beautiful souls, brothers and sisters all, may we know the harmony that comes with fellowship, that comes with the redeeming Love of God, that comes as we express the truth as we have learned and understood from the soul.

We are embraced by God at this moment. May you feel that embrace. May you know His Touch. May you truly open yourselves, that all that is vulnerable and tender is soothed by the Love of God, all that is yearning and feels the pain of a life lived in this worldly place may be healed by the Touch of God, and all that is of joy and wonderment, truth, wisdom may be awakened by the truth and power of His Love. We are His children and we know what true love is. May we be joyful together, celebrating the beautiful gift that is life, a beautiful soul that God has given us and is our true selves expressed and in the light. You are beautiful, beloved souls. You are in the light and you shall strive for greater light, greater beauty, greater love. It comes with every prayer. It comes as God beckons you forth to receive His Gift and acknowledge His true Being as you acknowledge yourselves. God bless you, beloveds, I am Mylora and I love you. I love you. God bless you, beloved friends.
