Received by Al Fike   


It is Seretta Kem. We continue to help enhance the conditions, portals, environment, aspects of this place which will be utilized as a Centre of Light in times to come. Indeed there is still much work to do and many things to accomplish but we continue to put forth our efforts to bring the ideal conditions forward and opportunities present to open the doorway to many blessings for this world. To have the opportunity to work in this way upon such hallowed ground is a great gift, and we acknowledge you, dear sister, for allowing the guidance to be given and to take the opportunity presented to help develop this place. The blessings will flow mightily, powerfully, and you will come to know them well.

Indeed your friend who has many gifts will open and discover many things through a prayer life upon this and within this Sanctuary of Light. I urge you to continue in prayer each and every day, to ask for the development, fulfillment of God's plan for this place and for each of you. For though things begin in a very small scale, they will open up to something more profound and wider in scope, touching many souls. As you listen to your guidance each day and fulfill your tasks as been requested, then indeed you build the foundation strong and you open the doorway to these many gifts and blessings from God. We are with you. We shall continue to be with you and walk together this path of service. Opportunities and directions that may surprise and astound you, but thus is the Will of God whose plan is often only fathomed for the moment but indeed moves swiftly towards the future. You will come to know this plan and see the manifestations of His Will upon this earthly place.

May God bless you, beloved souls. May you continue to listen, to hear, to walk step by step into greater light and to grow within your souls as you receive evermore of God's great Love. May God bless you and keep you in light. I am Seretta Kem and my love is with you all in these ventures which intrigue and excite and bring its great rewards. God bless you.
