# Many Ways to give Love

Collegeville, PA, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



My dear ones, it is I, Care. I have been here today watching over my dear Jimbeau and my dear grandson and his family and I am never far away. I was drawn into this prayer, feeling the heartache and grief and concern of many and it touched my heart, for we never wish another to suffer, and yet you are all in the midst of the labor pains of a new birth, not only of your world, but of your very souls being born again in the truest sense, transformed in the love of God. When you wonder and pray for those transitioning, those who have lost loved ones, your own loved ones in crisis, I ask you to always envision them whole, as you send love from your soul and ask God to bless them, His healing angels to care for them. The starting point is to go into your heart and open to love and as you humbly ask the Creator to infill your soul with His essence then you begin to feel this inflowing as in this circle. That is the point where you send out this current to those in need, those you are praying for, to be surrounded in this great love, to have the company of angels. 

There are many ways to give love from your soul. Sometimes, it is just a smile or a tender touch. It might be a song. It might be a kind word. When you send this out with the love in your soul, you send a beam of light to another, to the world, to the place where you are. You raise the vibration. You dispel the darkness and illumine the field. All healing is done in this light, in this love, and as the soul progresses in its transformation from being created in the image to the very substance, from the mortal to the divine angel, it is this love, it is this vibration that is a part of that awakening for the great change. So, as the song goes, all you need is love, love divine, for we are all one in the Creatorâ€™s love and warm embrace. I shall join you in this beautiful circle of light filled with such beautiful souls. Such tender hearts you are. We all love you deeply and eternally. With all my love and blessings in the grace of God, I am your sister in Christ, Care. God bless you.
