Encinitas C.A. U.S.A

Received by Al Fike   


Welcome to my Earthly paradise ( Self Realization Center in Encinitas CA), I am Yogananda. Never give up your search for truth, my beloved friends. For truth will come in many ways and show you many wondrous things as you seek out your heart, as you seek to discover and explore your soul. Do not give up your search for anything, my friends. For this time in your life upon the Earthly plane has the great potential to bring you to enlightenment quickly and powerfully. Never abandon your search.

So, as you eagerly search for truth, so truth will come to you. You will find your way through the maze of human thought and conjecture to that place that is of truth, and truth will come in all its simplicity and wonderment as you are open within your heart and soul to what God has to give. You have discovered a wondrous truth and that is, that God loves each of you beyond measure. Now, you must come to find how deeply God loves you and how infinite is that love and in this way you will travel the road to enlightenment and joy everlasting, joy deep and broad as the oceans, joy that never ends. 

Seek your comfort in God. For God will comfort you. Seek your truth from the ministrations of Godâ€™s great Soul, from His Love and you will know all truth in time, although that journey is forever. My beloved friends, I welcome you here and I say to you my love and appreciation for each one of you is great. For does not the world need more like you who are seeking truth and living truth and become a living truth in your life? 

My friends, God is with us all. May you come to know His deep blessing upon you, come to know all the wonders that can be had for a soul who is awakened and eager and desires all the blessings that God has to give. 

May His light uplift you, my friends. May the great truths of the Universe be infused within you. May you come to know who you truly are, that wondrous creation that God has made and nurtures to life. I will be with you as you gather together as will many from our world, the world of the Celestial Kingdom. For it is important that you gather and create light. Wherever you travel and wherever you may be, we will be with you. 

Beloved and beautiful creations of God, souls of light, awakening to truth, so you are and shall be and will be forever more. May God bless you with His Love and keep you and make you whole in love, joyful in love, beautiful and graceful in love. I am your friend, Yogananda, and I welcome you here (Yogananda Self Realization Center). Remember the great beauty of heaven is wondrous indeed and what you see about you here is merely a shadow, a glimmer of what can be and what is in my world. Drink in its beauty, beloved souls, and know there is so much more awaiting you and available to you as you progress within your souls, your consciousness, your being. 

Blessings to you, blessings from on high to the children of Earth. Thank you for coming, beloved souls. Thank you for thinking of me and thinking of truth and seeking out your Creator. So much comes from these thoughts and desires and yearnings. So much comes to fulfill that place within you that seeks fulfillment, that seeks truth, that seeks all that is of God. God bless you and may peace be with you all the days of your life, my friends. For you know where you must drink and abide so that you may be in that place where peace is everlasting and shall be with you always. God bless you, your friend and brother in love.
