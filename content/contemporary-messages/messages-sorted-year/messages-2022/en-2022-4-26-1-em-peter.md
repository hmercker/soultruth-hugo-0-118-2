# It's Not Easy to Build a Church

April 26<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Soul Awakening Tour, Holland America Cruise

Peter received by Elizabeth Mack

It’s not easy to build a church, but you will succeed. You have love, your love, God’s Love within you and this is how you will build it, brick by brick of love. You will succeed. You have behind you the angels in the Celestial Heaven. You have the force of God’s Love, the mightiest force, the greatest power in the universe, in this world and all of the worlds and the heavens. You will succeed.

Continue to press your love in the direction of those who need it. They will respond. You may not see it, but they will respond for they are hungry. They are desireous. They, too, long for the Love of God in their souls. Their minds, pithy things that they are, will not overcome the love in their souls. Continue to pray for your brothers and sisters and keep on praying, deeply, strongly, continuously, for their upliftment. They are beginning to feel it. They are beginning to notice. This is your work on Earth. We will not let you down. You will not let your brothers and sisters down, and God will uphold all of us. It is God’s promise to His Children. I am with you throughout this trip. I am Peter; yes, the Rock. I love you, all of you. My love goes with you every step of the way.
