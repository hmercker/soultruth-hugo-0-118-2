Received by Al Fike   


I am Matthew. I thank you, son, for coming to be with us in prayer. For you have been called and you have answered the call, beloved son. You shall find that we will be closer, ever closer to you as you seek God and seek the blessing of His Love.

There is purpose in this gathering today; there is an effort being made to establish the conditions, portals, and those things that accompany your prayers to make this a Center of Light, a beautiful beacon of light in the world.

Dear daughter, you have prayed for this and it is indeed manifesting. We have drawn these dear souls together to help anchor and intensify the light in the portal that is here. Many are coming to benefit from the blessings that have been established and are being established in this place. So we begin the work that is intended, part of God's plan, part of God's Will. And so you will feel the blessings as we, many of us from the Celestial Kingdom enter therein, this place, humble yet beautiful, that has the gift of drawing the healing energies from the earth. As you pray, you draw the great blessings from heaven and thus in this meeting place, great benefits of healing and love, comfort, will help to uplift many and show many towards the great awakening of the soul through receiving God's Love.

We thank you for coming and we pray with you. The conditions will build as you pray and so we urge you to pray as often as you can together. Though your numbers are small, the power of your prayers are great. So God will utilize your instrumentalities, your very being to help set into motion what is intended and what God wishes to bring to this place on earth where the energies meet and the blessings come readily.

May God bless you, beloved souls, may God bless you deeply, fully, powerfully in His Love. I am Matthew and I come to pray with you, beloved souls of the earthly plane.
