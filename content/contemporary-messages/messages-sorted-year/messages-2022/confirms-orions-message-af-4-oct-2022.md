I am Jesus, your brother and your friend, and I come to assure you of this dear brotherâ€™s [Orion] intention and existence in your lives. He is a great light and a great teacher, and we all work together to bring truth to humanity. My friends, be assured that much is given to a soul who is receptive and who seeks the truth. The only limitations are that which you place upon your search and your effort to be in harmony with God and all that God is, and all that God has created.

My beloveds, we are all His children, and there are many of his children scattered throughout the universe. Many unimaginable numbers of dear and beloved souls, seeking as you seek, living as you live, to express all that you are and in ways that are beautiful and expressive of God's Creation.

Know that life offers many opportunities to those who are willing and able to be in alignment with all that God desires for each of his children and truly be a child of their Creator. All whom we love, all whom we care for, all who desire to be uplifted. So we are within that flow and service and love and light. 
May God's love to continue to infill your souls, my beloved friends. We journey together always, and you are always in my prayers and my thoughts my beloved friends. Seeking for the highest, seeking to be with God, and so our kinship is strengthened with every prayer and every effort to be in alignment with God and to know His Truth of Love.

So we travel together, so we are brothers and sisters in a wondrous universe full of blessings and dynamic expressions, flowing and intermixing as these energies of God are magnificent and powerful and full of benefits for each of you.

May we all walk harmoniously together in loving acknowledgement of our Creator and loving expression of what God has created for each of us, and for all of us. God bless you, my beloved friends. God keep you in His Love. May you expand and grow and be transformed, transformed in truth and love and light. I am with you and shall always be so, beloveds. I am Jesus, and I love you all. I embrace you all.
