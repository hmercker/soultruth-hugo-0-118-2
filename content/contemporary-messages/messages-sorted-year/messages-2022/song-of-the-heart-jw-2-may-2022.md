# Song of the Heart and the Dance of Love  

May 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2022

Boscobel, Wisconsin, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



It is I your brother in song on the Divine love path of the heart. I come again, Inayat  Khan. The prayers that went out to the dear brother<sup>1</sup> brought many of us to his side influencing the caretakers and lifting him up in answer to your prayers. As always when you call, we come, and we shall continue. 

I spoke about music and song the sound of your voice and being open to healings and I wanted to continue here just to remind you of keeping a song in your heart. It might be a song of praise as in this circle. It might be song of grief to comfort those in mourning. It might be a song of rejoicing for an event, for your soul, for life. I spoke about how in the traditions, we shall say spiritual traditions including religions but beyond, of how important the vibrations of a song have been and continue to be, bringing harmony into a place, into a soul, into a group. So, suffice it to say there are many songs for many occasions.
    
If your heart leads you, you can dispel songs of vexation and inharmony which often permeate the atmosphere from souls who are suffering and angry and out of harmony and are really wishing to broadcast that. If you can look at that as a call for help and not be disturbed, you can send love, and ask the angels to influence those spirits and the person in need. I did not mention the last time, dance, for also in spiritual traditions there is dance. It may be as it is in my tradition a dance that wishes to connect body mind and soul to the Creator, as in the Whirling Dervishes Sema, but the Sufis also have dances of celebration. Consider all the cultures of the world and wedding dances, mating dances, dances of joy, dances of the beauty of the body and form. All have their place. But for you my dear brothers and sisters all I ask is that you do the dances with a song in your heart and rejoice in the love of God. With all my love and blessings for all and the blessings of our Glorious Creator, I leave you now for these moments of silence that we may all receive the great gift of God’s love. I am your brother in song on the path of God’s love, Inayat Khan. 

*Khalil Gibran speaks:*

I wish to add to my dear brother’s eloquence about the song of the soul and wish to say simply this. That the dance of the soul is the longing of to break free from the gravitational force of the earth and the body in exaltation and love. God bless you I am Kahlil Gibran
