# We Are All Praying for the World Healing Center Portal

May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Soul Awakening Tour, Blackpool, UK

Praying Bill received by Elizabeth Mack

There are many with us today at the World Healing Center. We will go with you. I am your friend, Bill. Praying Bill, I’ve been known as. Many new friends and old friends will be with us as we pray together to strengthen the portal, to bring through the love that is to be home there. We will be with you. Trust us all to come and help in these prayers that are so important to bring life back to the home of this portal. This will occur today with your prayers which can be maintained in the future.

We love you. We thank you for doing this. We hope you will enjoy your time there today. We love you, sister and we are glad to work with you once again. I am Bill, Praying Bill, as I was known on Earth in our short time together. We will be with you for the duration of your time here.

God’s love is pouring into you now, into all of you, strengthening this portal that has been established for your benefit during this retreat. Open yourselves to receive this gift from the Father. Let your souls open wide, bringing the glory of the Father into your own souls, that you may carry out your work in this vital place. Let your love flow. Let it flow into your souls and out to your brothers and sisters. We love you so much. We thank you for this opportunity to serve our brothers and sisters upon the Earth.
