# Mental Belief and Soul Perception

I am here your brother and friend in Christ, Robert Hugh Benson. Some of you may know me as monsignor which was my station on earth. Others may know that I was a writer and as a cleric I wrote with conviction many things that contained much error, much hubris from the intellectual power of my mind wishing to convince others that this was true that was false, this was right that was wrong. And yet, my soul did in fact hunger for truth, and when I retired from my religious position, I wrote science fiction based on my convictions I might say, and I was quite successful as a writer. 

When I crossed over, I was helped by a fellow reverend that I knew and you must know, when the scales are lifted from your eyes and you begin to see with clarity what you have done in error, you suffer as I did some remorse, but stronger than that was my wish to correct the errors. So many spirits, many Celestial angels have come through wishing to correct what they preached or what they wrote about or what they taught to their followers both past and present. Brother Yogananda is one, Rev. Owen, R.J. Lees, Eileen Caddy, Brother Mandus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Augustine, and many of the church as they are called fathers, and many preachers. And like myself, their longing was for truth, but their minds overcame their souls’ discernment and not until they passed over did clarity come to them as it came to me. And so, through my dear friend Anthony Borgia, I wrote and this one I speak through has shared that with others. 

So, I give you a foundation, but what I truly wish to speak about, is the difference between conviction in belief and a soul possessing the love of God. Ultimately when seekers explore the teachings, the many religions, the many philosophies on earth there is always hope that they get to a point of the failure of dogma where they ask, *“Where is the love, why am I not changed by this”?*  Many of you have had that experience if not all of you to a greater or lesser extent. So, please remember when you are out in the world, the world of conviction, that the simple stating of truth from your souls in love has a power that changes everything. Blessed you are to know the truth to such a degree that there is very little error in what you convey to others. But remember what is most important as what you read earlier from Yogananda,<sup>1</sup> about speaking with love, with all the love in your soul. 

When you call to God, *“God can you hear my prayer, can you help me”,* that  conviction, that force coming from your soul is always heard and always responded to. 

So, know again that when you speak the truth in love it is heard by the soul of the one you speak to whether it be the many or the few because soul responds to soul. 

Thank you for taking my message my brother and allowing me to introduce myself to those who do not know me. I shall come again as this wonderful circle of light drew me close. So, with all the love the love in my soul and the blessings of all of us here, I shall step back in prayer that God may bless each one of you with a showering of the glorious gift of His love. God bless all. I am your brother in Christ, Robert Hugh Benson.
