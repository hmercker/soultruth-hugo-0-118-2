# Progression beyond the Ebb and Flows of Earth Life

I am here, your sister and friend, Care. A good deal of my days on Earth, I spent in prayer and the more I prayed, the less the ebb and flow could affect me. For the earth is so filled with darkness and light and I know, my friends, how difficult it is to maintain a state of harmony, a state of prayer, allowing your will to be in the Father’s Will and Grace. Every morning I awoke in gratitude, praising God, thanking God for another day, and asking in my walk on the Earth, to serve, to be a blessing, as so many of you do in your prayer practice. 

As you receive this great gift of the Father’s Love, these ebb and flows of life have less force upon your soul and you are able to serve in grace, in Divine Love. And yes, as my dear sister Clare so beautifully said: *“The love of God is anti-gravitational”*, and I can tell you from my own experience, as you progress in spirit, discord not only diminishes, but ultimately disappears. God has provided progression, for it is the law, and those in deep darkness are able to relate to and are lifted up by those in less darkness and in return they are lifted up by those in some degree of light, and when they ask for God’s Grace they are lifted up by those who have the love of God illuminating their souls, and so on, all the way up into the celestial realms, where there is only the love of God. 

I realize these are lovely words to hear but in practicality, they may seem far off, so I want to give you this assurance, that as you pray on Earth, with all its difficulties, with all of the violence and trauma and negativity, as this love comes into your souls in greater and greater abundance, you are lifted up above the ebb and flows even on Earth. Your heart opens in complete compassion and empathy. Conflict becomes compassion. Fear becomes faith. Revenge becomes forgiveness. And you are given the truth in any given moment to express in whatever way resonates with your own soul. 

And so, take heart in these troubled times for there is always the light of God available and His great love to receive and to change you. You are such beautiful souls, and we love you dearly. Believe me, we do. With all my love and blessings, in the love of God, I shall step back and join you in His light and love. I am your sister in the celestial heavens, a redeemed soul in the love of God. I am Care. God bless you.
