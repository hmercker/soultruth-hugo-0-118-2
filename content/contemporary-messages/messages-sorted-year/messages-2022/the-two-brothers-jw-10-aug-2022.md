# The Two Brothers 

August 10<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Nashville, Tenn, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



Let me tell you the story of the two brothers. Both had the gift of mediumship, channels for light and love, and for truth. One brother, through the uniqueness of his soul, received very comprehensive and eloquent messages, stunning in their breadth and depth, and able to impress a wide spectrum of souls. The other brother, older though none the wiser, received what often seemed to be quite simple, parabolic, or allegorical messages that made a point through a simple story. These messages also had their eloquence. 

To some it may have seemed that one brother had overstated the case through spiritual redundancy, and yet one cannot overstate the truth. While in the case of the mediumship of the other brother one might have assumed that he had not disseminated enough information and perhaps had understated what needed to be said, and that is also false.Â For truth in both cases was perceived by the soul and therefore no matter if a message is lengthy or if a message is compact, the truth imparted in both cases is still the truth though it may be said that one appealed to a certain kind of soul and the other appealed to another.

Often the two brothers received the same truth at nearly the same time. If one was to examine though those messages and the dates they were received, they would see the core truth coming through both, albeit in what could be perceived as in very different ways. The brothers, generally, had no knowledge of what one had received in contradistinction to another or what the other had received, except in retrospect in which case they were always delighted.

So you see, there is a always a kind of collaboration from the Celestial Kingdom which results in the truth of God's Laws, His Universe and above all, soul transformation being received being received in a way that reflects the uniqueness of the receiver while imparting the universal truth.

So for each one of you it is imperative to continue along the path that resonates with you towards truth, that all may be changed, that all may be healed, that all may be blessed in Everlasting love. For this is God's wish and the wish of all of us here that you may complement each other. God bless you
