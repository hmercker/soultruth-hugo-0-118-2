I am here Mary Magdalene. I live in a sphere high in the Celestial realms. I came into your discussion about discernment and perceiving the truths of God’s Kingdom with the soul. Most are aware of my occupation while on earth and some are aware of my status in my community of Magdala. You may find it odd that I was a friend of many women, housewives, prostitutes of course, and the both the young and old women of my community, but that is the truth.

It is purported that I had the greatest understanding of the Master’s teachings when on earth. I will tell you there’s some truth to this but as there were many followers of Jesus, there were also others who felt the love of God and with their souls could comprehend the Master’s words as I did. And in those days as now, most people were occupied with material things, material distractions, material concerns. To those who find themselves in crisis and begin to see the futility of trying to find happiness and freedom in the possession of material things or the self-satisfaction of the senses, they begin to pray, each in their own way, for a healing, for truth, for redemption. And though they may not use the words, they aspire for their souls to finally be in ascendancy over their minds and for their hearts to open that their souls may be blessed. In your complex world this is truly the simplest of things though it requires setting aside all else for your time with your Creator, so that when you open your heart and your soul to Him, His love will come pouring into your soul without fail. Be still and relax that mind. Allow the blessing of God’s love to come into your soul. More and more you will begin to see the results as the depth of your prayers bring deep love and all your gifts to flourish.
  
Lastly, I say this, give yourselves time however you can, away from the world, and the news, and the vibrations of fear and bewilderment, and come into the safety and glory with us in the love of God. My dear ones, I thank you. Go in the love of God. I am Mary Magdalene.
