# Honour Mother Earth Who Loves Us So

September 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2022

Online Prayer Circle, Gibsons, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

May God bless you my friends, I am Mylora. Yes, all the elements of this Earth, when they are in harmony together, there is abundance. When this harmony is broken and not in balance, then there is a need for healing. So it is with your bodies, and so it is with the body of this Earth of yours. Your prayers are important to bring healing to your world, for surely, your world is not in balance. Surely, your world is in need of healing, because of all the weight of humanity upon it, needing so much, taking so much, and not returning to the Earth that which is needed for the Earth to be vital and beautiful.

It is not too late for humanity to awaken to their responsibility as stewards of the Earth, that each one who travels the ground must do so with responsibility and love. For, your Mother Earth is a being in her own right and is in need of your love. For does she not love you? In all her abundance and ways of giving, does she not bring forth all the wonders of her great bounteous self for your benefit? And each of you given the eyes to see, the wisdom of the soul to understand the love glowing within, to be generous in gratitude and love for your mother.

May you come to see that which you might do to help bring her back to balance and back to health. It is a world crippled with the disharmony of many acts of ignorance and lack of love. Not only for humanity who does this to one another, but humanity does this to their Mother Earth. Have compassion for your Mother, have compassion for yourself, have compassion for one another. Know that as you reach closer to God and climb closer to light, that the wisdom and the understanding will come, that you require to be a channel of light and love in the world. In so doing, you are a channel of light and love for your planet.

Beloved souls, God’s greatest desire is that harmony exists upon His Creation, this Mother Earth. He will do the utmost to ensure that harmony will come and to uplift each one of you so that you are expressing harmony, both within and around you. That harmony comes with the gift of God’s Love and the power of this Love to transform you and to make you into a beautiful channel of love and light in the world. It is not something you can do with your minds set forth to correct that which is wrong-doing and out of harmony. No, my beloveds, it is in your prayers to God and seeking to receive His great blessing of Love that the way will be open that you might be a channel of healing and light and wisdom for the world.

This is not as arduous as those who willfully set forth to make that which is right upon your world. That is an arduous task and one fraught with many pitfalls and challenges. With God and faith in God, the road becomes easier. Although not without its own challenges, it becomes easier as you seek to be in harmony with the flow of God’s Will and the flow of all that is of God. May you find yourself in that great river of Love, and may that river carry you forward, so that you may do your part in healing the world. For as you are healed, so you are a channel, an emanation of those blessings of healing for those around you and for the ground that you walk upon. May the light of your soul redeemed in love, be the light, blessing all around you, as God’s channels.

Beloved souls, many are in trouble. Many have no way of knowing, understanding, how they may be utilized as God’s channels. You must set forth as His instruments, as example, as lights, beacons of light in the world, so that others may see, others may feel, others may know the truth that you know. Beloved souls, the Earth will not be healed by the will of man, the Earth will be healed by the Will of God. May you align yourself with that Will and be in harmony with that Will. In this way, you will play your part in the healing of your Earth and fulfill your desire and your prayers for the Earth’s healing and balance and abundance to return.

Beloved souls, it is a new way of thinking and doing. It is the way of the soul, and you must find that way. You must see the power and beauty and wonderment of that way that is the way of the soul, the soul attuned to God, the soul as God’s instrument in the world. That way, you will find many opportunities to serve and much to do in the world as an instrument of healing and peace and harmony.

May God bless you, beloved souls, upon that journey. I am your friend, I am Mylora, and I love you. I love you all. God bless you, my friends, God bless you all. I love you.
