# May the Living Waters Flow

September 30<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Pacific Coast Soul Awakening Tour, Gibsons, BC, Canada

John the Beloved received by Al Fike

…of God’s Love, that it may carry you forth to greater light, greater soul light and love. I am John, John the Beloved, and I come to you to pray with you. As you continue in your journey of discovering God, so many of us who inhabit the Celestial Kingdom gather about you in your prayers, for it is our opportunity to be more fully upon the Earth plane. As you gather together and create this Circle of Light, you draw so many. You draw so many, beloveds, because these opportunities are rare for us to be so present. Although we do our work upon your earthly plane, the capacity for rapport, for closeness is diminished by the human condition.

When there are those who come together to pray for the Divine Love, the great activator of the soul, then we are able to come close, we are able to utilise the conditions and opportunity available to us to do our work amongst humanity. And as such, your prayers and gatherings are important, for they make possible many things, many things that you are not aware of, many things that we could not possibly show you. But there are many avenues of service that are made possible by your prayers, beloved souls. So do not take casually your commitment, but rejoice in the opportunity that God has provided for you in order that you may serve your fellow man.

May you receive that great gift of His Love that it may indeed flow copiously within your souls and awaken you, cleanse you, transform you so that you may truly be God’s instruments. As we journey down His River of Love, we are slowly being liberated by the waters, the Waters of Love. May you feel this and know this, beloved souls, and know how loved you are, how beautiful is your soul, how gracious is God’s Touch upon you. We are His children, all. We all gather, we all bathe together in this beautiful flowing River of Love. Feel the joy of it, feel the power of it, know the beauty of it, for we are all blessed. I am John and I love you, precious souls of God, my brothers and sisters in the light of truth. We are together and we carry one another as we go. God bless you. My love is with you, beloved souls. God bless you.
