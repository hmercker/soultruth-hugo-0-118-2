God bless you, friends, I am Michael Collier, and I wish to inform you that the angels have been working very hard to establish the truth of Divine Love in this country. A country in which I was born and lived my life on Earth, and have gone on to be a Celestial angel, understanding the truth, understanding many things that I did not know when I walked this earthly plane.

There are many souls in need of your ministrations. Many souls who are lost, many souls confused. This will not dissipate readily. You will find that there is much work to do. You will find that as you adopt the calling that God has for each one of you to bring the truth of God's Love, the truth of the soul, to those who are eager to learn and those who are in deep need and will find comfort in this truth, then the doors will open readily for you.

You will find that others will come to you, drawn, and of course it is not because of some circumstance or fluke. It is because they have been guided. See your life in this way, my friends, see your life as an open door for God, and then many will come through that door that God will guide towards you. Your life will then be a flow of service of love, of harmony, of opportunity, and as you open your eyes to this, as you see yourselves firmly upon this path of service and love, expressing truth, seeking truth for your own self, and also sharing truth with your brothers and sisters, so the world will open to you in ways that are unexpected and in many ways delightful.

The journey of service to God is one of beauty and surprise. The unexpected is to be expected. For you cannot fathom the plan that God has. You may only follow your guidance, day by day, and integrate His Plan into your day as you were shown the way, as you are given the direction.

My friends, there is much work to do, not only here in this country, but all over the world. But it must begin, it must begin. Rather than waiting for that moment, the moment is now. The moment comes and is presented to you. Of course with all things of God, you are given the choice.  And if you do not choose this is not indicate that God will punish or will not love you, for God always Loves you, but God will find other ways and other means to express His Plan.

Is it not a great gift to be able to be a part of the Divine Plan for the salvation of humanity? Is not this purpose of the highest nature? Is not this opportunity of the greatest of any opportunities that may have come to you in your life? These things are laid before you readily, easily. You may see within your mind complications and barriers, obstructions, but I tell you, if you trust within your soul that you may step forward and make this dedication to God in service, and follow this truth of Love, and pray for this Love daily, and ask God to be His instrument daily, these things will manifest and manifest clearly and beautifully in your life. 

I make this commitment to you, my friends, that when you step forward upon the Divine path in service that we will be with you. You will not be abandoned. You will not be alone. We will be with you and walk by your side and offer our counsel and protection and love to surround you. You will feel the upliftment. You will feel that you live in a different world from others, for in this way you do. You are in the world but not of it, when you are God's instrument.  This is our intention. This reflects our effort with you all, to remove you from the distractions of the earthly conditions and those desires that come with it, to that place where you are in alignment with God, and in the flow of His Love and purpose in the world. 

Yes, I know that to be so, purely and perfectly, is difficult and possibly unreasonable to ask of you, my friends, but to try to walk forward, to make an attempt, to be true to your soul's desire, which is to be in the state of grace, then you are fulfilling a great need within you, a purpose that God has placed within you, an opportunity that is laid before you.

My friends, the choice is yours, and indeed, every moment is a choice. But indeed, if you choose for light, so you will find that light will be drawn to you and light will be within your life and within yourself and there will be greater harmony in all things in regards to your life and your journey in the world.

Have faith and trust, my friends, have faith and trust in the Will of God, and that Will will bring great harmony and peace, fulfillment and love.  What more could you want in a life? What more, what higher calling is there than this?  So I ask you, my friends, follow the Will of God. Align yourself, your soul with God. Seek to be purposeful to serve humanity, and you will journey upon the life that is magnificent and wondrous and glorious. 

May God bless you upon that journey.  I am Michael Collier, and I am happy to be with you today as you seek out the secrets of your soul and the Truth of God. God bless you, my friends. God bless you.
