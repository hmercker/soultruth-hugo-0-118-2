Greetings, my friends. I am your teacher Augustine. You have asked for some guidance and commentary on the nature of grief. It is a worthy question and subject. Each individual who walks upon this Earth will experience grief in their life. It is a part of life. It is an emotion of the soul in its pure form. But when that emotion becomes burdened with mindful considerations, judgments, fears, resentments, and all conditions that are of the mind and the earthly conditions, then grief which when expressed from the purity of the soul would be a short-lived experience becomes one that carries on for some, for many years, and its burden and heaviness may even grow over those years rather than dissipate. It is because the individual senses a measure of self-worth and a sense of being alive when grief is present within them, for rather than feel joy, they feel the grief of loss, and this validates their being and their existence within the world.

This, as I suggest, is a manifestation of the mind rather than the soul. Conditions in your world reinforce this experience of the mind to such a degree that it overshadows all else within that individual’s life. In time they overcome this burden but they often do not do so quickly as the mind tenaciously holds on to this condition of grief. It is a universal burden rather than something that one reflexively creates as a condition within them. There is, shall I say, a layer, a condition of grief that surrounds your world. When one has a loss within their life that is profound and severe, then often, they become aware of this condition that is universal upon this planet. Thereby, the condition is reinforced as the individual continues to be in alignment and attunement with it.

The key is to feel and release rather than to feel and reinforce the condition of grief. Loss is a natural part of life. Yet, when one views life from the perceptions of the soul and the feelings and acknowledgment of the soul,  such emotion is only part of a process that may be quickened by understanding and by love. I do not condemn those who are burdened by grief for have we not all felt it in our existence at some time? I feel compassion for those who continue to reinforce this condition within them and feel that there is no way to be released from it. This is not the case. With prayer, compassion, and love, these conditions can be lifted.

Indeed, your angel friends are all too willing to assist you in this and to help you overcome it for it is not a pleasant condition. It is not one that allows and engenders a sense of being alive and engaged in life in a harmonious way. Rather, it is a condition that tends to take away from life. Yet, when it is felt in its pure form from the soul, it is indeed a crying out to God saying “I feel this sense of loss. I am saddened by it. Can you not help me to release this so that I may come back to a place that is of joy and fulfillment?” This prayer may be presented many times for often that pang of grief may come to consciousness at any given moment in one’s day.

Experiencing grief gives the individual an opportunity to pray, confront, perceive, acknowledge, and release this condition. In grief comes a deep prayer often, a deep longing for God, a deep sense that there is something missing within the individual. So, they must come and find out what it is that is missing. In truth, it is in the understanding of the soul which realizes that they have not truly lost the individual but there is a different state of that relationship that can be acknowledged and can bring a sense of closeness rather than distance.

Indeed, this condition, which is so prevalent and so powerful in your world is a great challenge to all of you. Each of you has felt the sting of grief and loss. Each of you has come to overcome it in some way, finding some equilibrium rather than be overbalanced in the weight of grief. This too is a lesson in life. This too is an opportunity to grow and allows you to acknowledge those deep emotions within you, so to understand and discern what is truly of the soul and that which is of the mind.

God has formulated life in such a way that many experiences come with it. Each experience can be a blessing, a way of learning, growing and awakening to further truth. It is, as in every case, a situation of choice, of free will, of desire. So you continue  with life dealing with those challenges and conditions that come with it. It is our wish that you come to life with great faith and desire to be in the light and in harmony with all that which is of God and God’s creation. Knowing His Love in such a deep and profound way that when you encounter the loss of a loved one, of something difficult to acknowledge, that you may bring this to God and have a quick and easy transition from that place of deep suffering and grief to  joy and release.

This can be for each of you, beloved souls. It must come in accordance with your will and desire. For some it is not easy because they are burdened with multiple conditions and situations that engender grief. Thus you must pray to assist your loved ones and those around you who are suffering in this way. Prayer is the catalyst to bring healing, upliftment, and light. Prayer is the way to open the door to relief and healing.

My beloved and beautiful students, may you continue to grow in the Light of God’s Love and come to understand the world that God has created, how you may live in this world in harmony with His creation, in harmony with love, in harmony with light. Every day brings its opportunities and the possibilities of growing in the light, of being within the Truth of God’s Love and God’s reality so that you are not so burdened by these earthly conditions, so heavy and so difficult. It comes as you grow, for this brings a sort of detachment so that you are not so emotionally invested in pain and suffering. Rather, to brings to you joy and upliftment. Strong enough within the soul that the mind and the conditions and exactitudes of the mind do not dictate your emotions and your state of being. Rather, it is within the soul that reflexively expresses joy that is expansive, that is of light, that you may live in this reality, this condition, this expression of your true being.

May God bless each one of you on that journey toward greater light, relief from all conditions that are not in harmony with God’s Love and Laws, that you are free, that you are open and joyful and insightful and all those things that bring light. My beloved, beloved students, be with God always and you will find your way to freedom, expansion, and joy. Thank you for listening to me. I do not say these things to criticize or to make another feel that they have not fulfilled this law, the Law of Love, for each of you has your struggles. Indeed, those struggles always point toward some solution, some way to overcome your own personal condition. This is God’s Will, His Love for you, to bring healing and relief, joy and upliftment. It can only come, however, when you desire this, when you ask for it, and when you open yourself to it. So, God waits for your asking and the inclusion of His Presence in your life. May you find that way, beloved and beautiful students. May you find your way to light.
 
My love is with you. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
