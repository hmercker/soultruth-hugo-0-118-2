# Blesses and Encourages Us

October 8<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Pacific Coast Soul Awakening Tour, Menifee, CA, USA

Jesus received by Al Fike

Seek the Love of God, my beloved brothers and sisters. I am Jesus. I come to uplift you and the conditions of your world and to assert the truth: the greatest pursuit in life is to find your soul's at-onement with God. For with this blessing and knowledge, all things of good and of light and of harmony will follow in its stead. It is for you to recognise that this blessing of the Father's Love must be the foundation of your life, and it does not come through the imposition of any one person in the world, but comes with your commitment and your prayer and your reaching out to God.

It is a personal journey. One without limit. One without end, but it must begin with your assertion to be with God, to seek God. To open yourself to your Heavenly Father in humility and supplication and desire to be with God in all things, will bring a great light to you and through you, beloveds. In this way you will know the truth from that personal awakening of your soul. You will be God’s instrument because you are in alignment with Him. You will be true to all that is of His Laws of Creation because you have chosen the highest path towards at-onement.

All lies in your choice, beloveds. All is in your hands, my beloveds. All will come with your desire to be in alignment with God and His Truth of Love. Step forward, beloveds, and be my disciples. Step forward and be a light in the world. Step forward in love and all shall follow in your stead. As you seek to serve God and serve your brothers and sisters in the world, you will know your steps. It will not be a mystery but will be known. As you find your way, the path will be lit with God's Touch upon you and His guidance for you.

Be at peace, my beloved and beautiful friends. Be at peace and love. Be at peace because the benediction of God is upon you and shall continue to flow and uplift and change you forever.

Beloveds, all problems and dilemmas have their source in the lack of love. So as you discover the power of love, the glory of love, whether that be of your natural making or that of God, together they become a formidable force in the world and in your world. They bring the solutions, they bring all that is required to be in alignment with God's Laws of Love, God's Laws of Creation.

May you be powerfully blessed, beloved souls. May His Light touch your soul and awaken it, awaken it to all that is of the Glory of God, the wonderment of Creation, the joy of life. Awaken, beloveds, to His Touch, as the Holy Spirit conveys His great blessing upon your soul, and you will find yourselves unburdened, strengthened, and wise, knowing the joys of love felt and known and expressed through you and within you.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend, I am Jesus. I come to uplift and encourage you, beloved souls, who are seeking, who are in need of the Father’s Blessing upon you. God bless you and keep you in His Light, beloved and precious, brothers and sisters all. Feel and know the awakening of your soul and you shall indeed be freed from the encumbrances of the human condition.

God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I come to be with you in prayer, and I love you. God bless you in peace, in love, in light.
