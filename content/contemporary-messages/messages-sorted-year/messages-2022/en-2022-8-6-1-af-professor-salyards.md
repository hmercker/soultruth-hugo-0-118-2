Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, it is Professor Salyards. Though you assess yourselves and the impediments that you carry as being a serious issue in your lives, I say to you, compared to so many more upon your plane, you have gone a great distance, each one of you, though some have started many years ago and others, not so long ago. Each of you, through your efforts and prayers and efforts together, have grown greatly and developed in great light. So I urge you not to criticise yourself or feel that you are incapable and imperfect in this great venture that we are together within. Beloved souls, beautiful souls, you are the light of the world. How many are the light of the world? Not many at all I'm afraid. Yes, we rely on you greatly for your consistency and your efforts and your desire to be a channel of light in the world, and truth and love. But indeed, in many respects, you are fulfilling this purpose and desire.

Of course, there is always a long way to go for those of you on the earthly plane. We in the spirit realms and in the Celestial Kingdom have it so much easier since we know the truth and are able to spend much time in prayer and seeking out God. You, on the other hand, must deal with the earthly expectations and needs in order to survive upon your world. So you carry a double burden; the burden of the conditions of your world and the burden of the needs that you carry in order to be in this world. Beloved souls, know that we are with you to help you in these regards, to help you to be in the light, to be truly in harmony and truly within the flow of God's Will. In the majority of cases, as we work together, we are effective, we are truly within that flow. Though there's much more that can be done and will be done in the future, know that we continue to work together and strive together for all those conditions and efforts in harmony with God's Will that will bring about the changes that are required upon your earthly plane.
Give yourself a pat on the back, my friends. For you are truly in the light, though you struggle and there are conditions around you that require your attention, and often conditions that try and detract from your well-being and your harmony. But I say to you, within your soul is a great light and a great wisdom and great love. It is there where you must go in your prayer to be with God. For within your soul and your efforts in prayer, so you will truly reach the Creator, and bring to you the many blessings and upliftments to help neutralise those conditions that are not of light.

My beautiful friends, we continue to pray together, and I thank you for the time that you make, the efforts that you make, the thoughts that you put forward in harmony with the truth, in harmony with light. All of these things are building within you and through your life, and they shall continue to build and quicken in this process and flow of your life's journey in service to God.

My beloved friends, be at peace and know that you are loved. Seek out the Father's Love and know that in this way all things are possible and that all that is of God's Will may be realised. Blessed and beloved souls, be true to yourselves. Be true to God. Be true to all those things that are of light. All is well, my beloved friends, as we continue on this journey. God bless you. I am Professor Salyards. My love, my thoughts, my prayers and my efforts are with you all and shall be for all the days of your life upon this Earth. God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you.
