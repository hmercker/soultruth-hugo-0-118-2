# Allow God 

February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2022

Punalu'u, Oahu, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh   



I am here Aunty Eileen. Though the world is filled with obstacles, and you feel that pressure, your prayers poke holes in the darkness allowing the rays of light to break down resistance turning it into acceptance. Being in rapport is allowing your soul to be in ascendancy over your mind, letting your brain take a rest, and allowing Godâ€™s love to flow into you. What I say to you now is not much different than what I received while on earth except to say oneness with God is matter of being humble and allowing the inflowing of the love. 

My brother here who is considering, if I may say, of going up against some resistance to what he knows is his calling and his wish to serve the truth, to follow his guidance. I wish him to remember what you have read earlier about what I received about being the light, being the energy of love. For when you do this you are like a mirror. And when you are up against negativity, or doubt or error the mirror of light and love can only reflect the truth, and where that is coming from is Divine. This allows the one who is looking into that mirror the choice of opening to that love, responding to that love or walking away from the light. I shall be with you my brother when you need me. All you can do is offer your love and your service and I say this to all here. May you stay in the love as you serve others, for your soul is blessed as you remain in rapport with the Celestial kingdom, your soul will be awakened. 

In your sharing your Divine Love you are blessed in the receiving of the Essence of the Heavenly Father. Just allow it! Do not be troubled. Walk in love, speak in love, sing in love, teach in love. Plant those seeds that they may fall on fertile ground. Let the sirens<sup>1</sup> ever remind you that God comes to the rescue whenever you call. Sing a joyful song unto the Lord. Praise God! 

I love you. Go in Peace and in the Grace of God. I am Auntie Eileen. God bless you.
