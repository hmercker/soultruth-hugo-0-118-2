# Bless and Encourage Us

Pacific Coast Soul Awakening Tour, Menifee, CA, USA

James & Helen Padgett received by Al Fike

May God’s Love be your mainstay, my beloved friends. I am **Padgett, James**. Whether the truth of the matter comes from the Bible, from the works that came through me, or the works that came through this instrument, or other sources, provided it directs the individual towards the truth, does it matter the source? So, we all must be humble in our perspectives regarding the opinions of others and how they may approach their own spiritual life.

There are many approaches. Approaches, indeed, in many possibilities of experiences and mindful acknowledgements that bring the individual towards God. Thus, in your very diversified world, to try and lay a standard to crystallize the word, so-to-speak, is a very difficult task indeed, and one which you may apply many hours of effort and research and put in print many words, which signify to your mind, the appropriate phrases and teachings towards truth. And yet, if those words do not penetrate the consciousness of another, then what good are they?

What is important is the light within your soul, your motivations, your desires. These things work together to align themselves with God's Will, provided they are in harmony with God's Laws, and as a great gift of His Love continues to change, transform, and heal you, so the words and the perspectives will change in accordance to this inner dialogue that is your soul, which makes great effort to communicate with your conscious self.

So, those who are rigid in their thinking and do not abide by any other approach does not mean that they are upon the wrong road. It merely means that they are fearful of other roads and other approaches. They feel vulnerable, cast into something that is not familiar, and they react in fear.

I felt the same when the messages from Jesus and other Celestials came through my gifts of automatic writing. I did not know how to reconcile these things with my own beliefs, and I felt like I was an imposter because how could these things be true? How could Jesus come to me? And this message of Divine Love, it was very confusing. It did not align with biblical scripture. But in time, by applying myself and analysing the words given and then reapplying them into a prayer practice, which you do my friends as well, then the truth became evident. The experiences were consistent, and I knew that there was something happening within me as a result of my prayers.

Indeed, my Celestial friends were very patient with me. God was very patient with me, and so, you must be patient with others and accept the road that they have dedicated themselves to.

The idea of unifying all those who have a belief in Divine Love is a bit naïve. For how can you change the minds of men? Many have tried through force and willful effort, but indeed, each individual has their unique path to God. It is when you can come together in unity and harmony that you all acknowledge the truth that God is Love, and that God loves each of you and wishes for you to know His Love and receive the very Essence of His Soul, which is love. These simple words are more acceptable to many,  and if you were to give detailed instruction and advice in teaching to your brothers and sisters who are seeking, it is more important to be love, to express love, to shine with love, then to speak of love, for speaking is a dim reflection of truth, yet shining forth in the light of love, embracing your brothers and sisters in love, accepting them in their present condition and attitudes with love, is more powerful than any words, any book, anything that can be given to the mind. For it is the expression of the soul, my friends, that is the most important aspect of your ministry, and so, you must come to know your own soul.

You must come to know God through your own soul. This journey is the basic tenant of your beliefs and a basic truth. For without knowledge of your own soul, keeping yourself imprisoned within the mind, the material mind, feeling very little, and yet thinking very much, is the great struggle that I had upon the Earth, and many have upon your Earth. Continue to mind the depths of feeling, of sensing, of that subtle part of you that is your soul that is crying out, yearning for God, being in alignment with all that is of God.

This is the very foundation of any work that comes if you have declared yourself a disciple of Jesus. Then indeed, you must know, truly know, what Jesus has taught. Not in so much in words, but in experience and knowledge of the soul, perceptions of the soul.

And so, we continue to urge you to awaken, my friends, to awaken to your own soul, to awaken to God. For indeed, the powers of your earthly plane all conspire to keep you asleep, not to awaken.  So, you go against the tide. So, you take the road less traveled. So, you make that choice to be in the truth, and the truth can only be understood fully by your experience with God, and in that experience of receiving His Love, of truly feeling and knowing His Presence and His Love, it cannot be revealed by words. It must be revealed by an open heart, that tender and vulnerable place within you that seeks to be comforted by the hand of God.

Through your lives you have been trained to be resolute and invulnerable, but indeed, these act as roadblocks to your true knowing and feeling. So, you must allow yourselves to be sensitive, to be open emotionally, spiritually, soulfully, open to the truth. In this way, the truth will pour into your consciousness. The truth will be evident, and the truth is something that will be difficult to explain to others. For without the experience of it, it is merely words, as I say are a dim reflection of what truly is.

I know you feel you are in a sort of conundrum where you must speak the truth and you must share with others the truth, and you do so, as anyone does upon your earthly plane, through words and actions, and logic and all of those things of the mind, and I do not condemn this or explain to you that these efforts are useless. Rather, it is a matter of balance and focus. For rather than putting the cart before the horse, we wish for you to be that beast, that beautiful animal that is your soul, to seek out God first, and then you may harness the soul and teach.

The greatest teachers are those who truly believe in what they say and what they have experienced personally, and so we wish for you to be great teachers, each one of you, in this world of yours that seeks out those who are sincere, trustworthy, with integrity, and who are truly confident of the words which they share.

How is this built? It is built through your experience with God. It is built because your soul knows and you have trusted within you that knowing and have allowed this balance to be achieved, the balance that comes through experience and then the application and expression of that experience in your life.

Beloved friends, there is always much to learn. There is always much to go on your path towards greater understanding and greater truth. And so, you will find your way, you continue to find your way. Do not allow the distractions of your world to hold you back at this time. For each of you have tested the truth. Each of you have now come to understand the power of the truth to influence and inform your daily life.

May you continue to have faith in the truth of God's Love and all that that entails. In this way, you will know how to proceed, you will be guided accordingly. You have been told this numerous times, and yet, part of you still doubts, part of you still feels inadequate, part of you feels unworthy. Put these things aside, my friends, and truly know the Will of God, the Love of God, and the power of God's Will. In this way, your life will become a beautiful expression of truth and love and joy.

Do that which I could not do while on Earth, for I did not allow myself that luxury. Be free of the human condition and dance within the light and joy in God's Love. Be that individual, for it is within you, each of you, and in this way, you will draw many others to you. And yes, there will be rejection, but that is inevitable. No matter what course you take in your life, rejection often follows because if you put more credence in the ideas and judgements of others and you have lost your way, you do not know yourself. But when you put your faith in your own journey and who you truly are, and love yourself accordingly, and indeed the gates open. The journey becomes powerful and beautiful, glorious in its expression in your life.

Thus, many things will come into your life that are unexpected and wonders, many blessings flow, many individuals who you would not dream of meeting will come, will be within that journey of your life. And so, you will have been God's instruments in the world in clear and wondrous ways, bringing the power of His Love demonstrated in the world, adding light to the world, adding truth to the world.

Is this not what you all desire, my friends? And it shall be so, provided you are in alignment with God's Will, the truth of God's Love, the simplicity of God's teachings and the laws which are of love.

So, I will leave you, my friends. I am so pleased that you are together, that you will continue to support one another, and I will be close to you, my son, as you continue to work your way towards the next phase of your life. The instrumentality and the purpose that God put within you will shine forth and be a beautiful beacon of light in the world.

And you too, dear daughter, who tentatively steps forward and wonders. You are a beautiful light, and you will know a beautiful life as God’s instrument in the world. This is inevitable. It is only, the course of this is only slowed by your reluctance or lack of self-acceptance, and this is a common malady in the world, which you will overcome, and with your mate, indeed, the two of you together will be a formidable force, a beautiful light, and all will unfold in accordance to God's plan.

Beloved daughter, truly believe in yourself and know yourself, and do not take umbrage when others may reject or even slight you. Rather be joyful in your own relationship with God, knowing the angels are with you, knowing that all that will come of your life will be a beautiful outpouring of God's Will, manifest in many ways in your life.

I thank you, beloved souls, and know that I am close. Your friend, James. I am here, and shall be here, all the days of your life. Beloved friends, God bless you and keep you in His Love. My love is with you, beloveds.

And I am **Helen**. I come to reassure you, dear daughter, that all is well and that all shall be well on the path that God has blessed, has lit for you, and is upholding you. Have faith in this, dear daughter. Have faith in all that is within your life that is good and of light. Have faith in all that is within you, which is good and of light, and be at peace. Be at peace, beloved daughter. Know that you are loved. Know that God has created a unique beautiful soul that is you, and how He cherishes you, beloved daughter, how you are truly loved.

And when the conditions of this Earth weigh upon you, go to God and ask for His blessings and upliftment and Love.  And truly He will answer your prayers and bring you to Him.  He will embrace you and bring you peace. He will infill you with Love. And so, the goodness will be increased, the light will be increased as you step forward into each day seek God's blessings, sit in prayer and come to know God, truly know God, and know how much you are loved, and know how beautiful you are, and how your gifts may shine forth in all its glory, all wonderment of your soul in alignment with God.

I love you, beloved soul, I love you. Oh, we are so alike in many ways. My struggles on your Earth were the same, and so I understand. I know. I know the fears and the hurts and the pain. I know all of these things, and I truly have come to assist you and uphold you in light, in love, and the grace of God.  I am close. I am Helen, and I love you. And I love you all, beautiful souls, seeking God. I love you all. God bless you.
