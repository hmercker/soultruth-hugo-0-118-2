# You are Coming to Know Us in God's Love

November 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2022

Received by Al Fike   


It is your teacher Augustine. May the Grace of God’s Love infill your soul, transforming it into a soul Divine, a true child of God, that you may come to see and know and experience the reality of God, the reality of a soul that is in alignment with God for this is the state of grace which you are all desiring and working toward. It comes incrementally and slowly. Yet, it is indeed coming to fruition. 

The state of human reality and existence is far different from that which God has intended. When all is in harmony with God’s Laws, then indeed humanity will have free and easy access to the higher spirits and angels of this world. In so doing, many mysteries, much knowledge and truth can be given readily. You will know of its source and discern its intention rather than feeling somewhat vulnerable and confused by the attempts of spirit to communicate with you.
At present, if you were to open to this reality given your soulful state and mindful condition, you would have a great deal of trouble navigating these conditions and spirits that are around you at this time. Although, we offer you a great deal of protection. We keep you in the light, as do you with your prayers and efforts. Still, to be aware and open to the great variety of conditions that exist on your Earth plane would be very distracting and distressful for each of you at this time. So, you are closed somewhat to our presence and our communication. The door opens at times and the door closes at times. This is accomplished by our efforts when needed and by your desires when expressed.

Because of this erratic experience and condition that you deal with on a daily basis, often it engenders confusion and difficulty in discerning and understanding that which is of higher guidance, that which is a blessing from God given to you in guidance. Yet, as you grow in the Father’s Love, as you continue to awaken with your faculties coming alive and your being growing brighter, these present issues will become irrelevant. You will find yourselves in the light and glory of God’s Grace, not a victim or in distress when you come to meet the many spirits that are around you. Rather, you will be in control and will have the possibility of deciding how you may open up and to whom you may open.

Each of you will go through this process, these growing pains, in order to awaken in your own particular way, because you are each unique, coming to what is the reality of spirit. Indeed, our wish is that you are acclimatized and attuned to the Celestial realms and the angels that come from these realms to communicate with you. Yet, there are times when communicating with those in the seventh sphere and the fifth sphere, even the third sphere, will be a benefit to you, even some from the natural love spheres who are eager to assist you in your work, that of healing, that of discerning and growing in truth, for they too possess a measure of truth. Yet, the predominant influence must be that of those souls who are in alignment and continue to pursue the Truth of Divine Love and those of us who have been transformed and live within the Celestial realms.

Yes, these things are coming to you, my beloved friends. This reality is emerging, ever so slowly. You will find as time goes by that your sensibilities and your perceptions of us in the Celestial Kingdom will become more acute and more refined. This is your soul awakening. This is your capacity to perceive and to be in alignment with light, which reflects the growing love within your soul. The unfolding of your being includes the recalibration of your consciousness, your reality. As the mind continues to become in alignment with your soul mind, then indeed these things will become more obvious and acute.

My beloved brothers and sisters, students of the truth, know that we are with you always and our efforts are ceaseless in helping you to grow and be more attuned and come to see and realize the great blessings and gifts and benefits of this Path Divine. You will find your way, beloved, beautiful souls. You will find your way as you continue to test the waters, confront your own personal struggles and dilemmas, and be in greater alignment with God and His Truths of Love.

You are all growing. Your dedication is obvious and very much needed. Your efforts in prayer will bring the results that you desire. The unfolding of your gifts will come in harmony with that which is a blessing and a reflection of your true soul’s desires and allowing for the adjustments that are required in order to integrate these openings and blessings of your inner self, your soul. 

My beloved pupils, may you continue to listen, to grow, to yearn for, to pray for, and to be in alignment with all that is in harmony with the Divine Love and the Truth of this great gift that God gives willingly, abundantly, and joyfully. May you indeed know the joy of this beautiful journey, the awakenings that come, that upwelling of joy from your soul as you recognize these things that are emerging from your soul and coming to consciousness. So much is coming to you, beloved souls. So much is meant for you. So much is intended so that you may be effective, beautiful, powerful channels of love for God.

All come on the whim of your own desires, with the expression of your own soul, and the intention that is deep within you to serve God in love, to serve your brothers and sisters in love. So you will, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you. I love you dearly. God bless you. God bless you deeply.
