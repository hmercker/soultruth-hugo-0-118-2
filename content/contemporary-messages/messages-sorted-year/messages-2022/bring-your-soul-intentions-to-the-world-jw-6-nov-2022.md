# Bring your soul intentions to the world

It is I Care. I came on the love of God as your sister in Christ. I sometimes described myself while on earth as a prayer warrior because those were the weapons that I had to confront the world. And as you may know my prayers served me well and protected me and my family. And yet, like all warriors, I had wounds. My wounds not so much physical but spiritual wounds. I did realize at some point as the purity of my intentions became obvious to me that I could walk in faith. I could give up my shyness and my hurt and bring the truths of God’s love and the prayers for God’s Love and my conversations with the Angels to the world, despite whatever criticism I might receive, so that whenever an opportunity arose to serve, I did.
 
And I say to all here and beyond, allow the purity of intentions, your pure hearts, to look beyond perfection, to go beyond the hurt and the wounds and bring your walk in faith to the world knowing that not all will respond in a positive manner and some maybe will not respond at all, but those that you touch will be forever grateful as my beloved is to me and more importantly, to God. So bring your heart and its intentions to the world in the love of God and you cannot fail. And you may be quite surprised at how well you succeed.
   
I thank you and I bless you and I love you. I am your Celestial sister in Christ, I am Care. God bless you.
