Jesus received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloveds. I am here, your brother and friend Jesus. I wish to speak to you about God’s plan for the salvation of humanity and that I see that each of you have committed yourself to be a part of this plan and to be used in whatever way that God deems is necessary and required for the execution of this plan.

Have you thought of when this plan began, my beloved friends? It did not begin with your birth. It did not even begin with my birth. But it began many eons ago when God presented to the first parents the possibility of tremendous soul progression and transformation through His Love. From that day on, His plan continued to be formulated, as the choice of the first parents was that of rejection. Then God, in His Wisdom and His perceptions and His sense of eternity, formulated a plan to bring humanity to His Love and His transformative powers within the soul. Thus, I was born as part of His plan, and I did the work that I was meant to do at the time on Earth and continue to do this work as I dwell within the Celestial Kingdom and travel throughout the realms of spirit and the material plane.

You too have chosen to be a part of God’s plan, not just within your mind at some point in your life on this world, but you chose before you incarnated, to be a part of God’s plan. Thus, the depth and breadth of His plan being expressed and executed in the world is great. What you see for yourself is but a small portion, a very small portion of what that plan is for humanity. Yet you persist and you are here and you continue to exercise your will in concert with God’s Will in order that His plan may be realised.
Your efforts are extremely important, beloved souls, for you are moving consciously within God’s plan and God’s Will. You have made that decision to be in harmony with His intentions and to be open to His guidance. To be within the Will of God is to exercise the power of your own faith and desire and will to be in harmony with that of God and His Will. Never forget this, beloved souls, that you have a choice with each moment, with each thought, with each deed. 

You have a choice to be in harmony with God’s plan or not to be in harmony. There are times when indeed, the extent of your harmony with God’s plan is great, and we rejoice at your choice and your efforts. There are times when you move away and turn your head, distracted by some condition of the earthly plane. Of course, there are many, many conditions in your world that are powerful and a powerful determinant of your focus and consciousness. Yet you persist, as do we, in this great effort to bring humanity to light, to the salvation of their souls, to the truth that will set them free from the human tyranny, this condition that has been created over millennia. What you create together, and with your fellow souls who are a part of this, is laying a foundation that will have its effect, not just in your lifetime, but for many centuries to come. Do you realise how powerful your commitment is, and how this will not be buried under the neglect of human memory, but will be known? What you create together will be the seed for the growing and flowering of something wonderful.

Beloved souls, you have chosen to be God’s instruments. You have chosen to be a part of God’s plan. You have chosen to grow your soul in the truth, which is His Love transforming you. You wish to commit as much as you can and desire to be in alignment with His plan, with God’s Will. Indeed, you have been powerfully blessed as a result of your commitment. You have been given much in terms of our attention and God’s Touch and blessings upon you. 

We have great hope in your ability and commitment to be a part of this plan, to be in consort with us, with God, with all that is good, with all that is in harmony, so that in times to come, the darkness will be dispersed and the light will shine forth clearly, warming the souls of humanity, bringing wisdom, truth, and all that is required, to transform this world from that which is flawed and that which is not in harmony with God’s intentions for this world, towards that which is in the light and in harmony.

Beloved souls, you are the forerunners of a great momentum to change the minds and souls and spirits of humanity towards that which is of light and truth and peace, that joy may abound upon this world, and that the needs of humanity will be met in such a way that there is harmony in your world. God has a tremendous plan, a plan that requires many moving parts, many souls expressed in concert with what is intended. May you come to know your place within it, and may you move as in a beautiful ballet of individuals working together, creating something beautiful and magnificent. God will guide you thus, beloved souls. God will bring you what you require in order to move in harmony with His Will. 

God will send you forth as lights, beacons of light, harbingers of love, speakers of truth, His instruments upon the Earth, provided you are willing to step beyond the old ways, the old conditions which you have been a part of. But indeed, God’s Will and intention for each of you is that you be released from these things and choose that which is of God, in harmony with His Laws of Love, in harmony with His Will. These things come as you step forward day by day. These things will flow into your life, a gift, a blessing, refreshing you and bringing joy to your heart, His Love flowing abundantly, His guidance clear, powerful, beautiful. 

You will find your way, beloved souls. You are finding your way upon the Divine Path, exploring Divine Will, and Divine intention, and Divine purpose. This comes to your consciousness as you grow in love, as you continue to shed the old and worn patterns of your life, donning that which is new and beautiful. 
Beloved souls, know that we are with you always and that we continue to work with you. We all continue to work in harmony with God’s Will to help save your world from that which is not of God, but of man. So it shall be, my beloveds. So it shall, be as we continue to walk forward in love, and seek the truth, and be the truth.
 
May His Love continue to pour within you. May you open yourself wide, fully anticipating and desiring this gift. Be in the truth of His Love. Walk in the truth of love. Be that light, beloveds, the light that is so needed in the world, a light that will be a powerful transformative agent in the world. 

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am your brother and your friend and I am with you. I am Jesus and I love you so, beloved and beautiful souls. I love you so, my true brothers and sisters in the world, disciples of truth, lights of God. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. May peace be upon you. My love is with you.
