# The Healing Balm of the Love of God

January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2026

Online Circle of Light, Nashville, TN, USA

Luke received by Jimbeau Walsh

May the love of God be a healing balm to all those in need of healing, to all those feeling afflicted by the weight of the world, to all those grieving the loss of a loved one. It is I, Luke, and I wish to remind you that when one is ill and feeling one’s body struggling to be again a harmonious being, one begins to allow the body to repair, to allow the medicine to do its work. And when one recovers, and the dis-ease passes, and one is restored to a state of well-being, there is a joy that comes upon one. One could say it is a state of post-illness and that whatever was the cause of this dis-ease or disharmony has been expiated. The soul is lifted, wellness is restored, and hopefully, there is a deep sense of gratitude.

We have spoken before about grief, most especially for our loved ones in spirit, and we have reminded you that your grief is but a reflection of your love. And when you remember those who have passed, and you remember the times you were together in joy, in love, in oneness, you can be lifted up, and you allow those in spirit to be lifted above their concern for you. Thus, both parties can progress and be healed, and as a sense of well-being comes after an illness, I wish you to consider those who have suffered in the human condition being restored to wellness in spirit and being met in love and light by so many.

It is a great truth that we are all in this together, in spirit, on earth, in mortality and immortality, in the human condition, and on the path to the heavens and the celestial realm. When you feel this love, this gift from above, and there is a oneness of your soul with all souls, but most particularly with the great soul of God, you have come one step closer.

So, lastly, I say, comfort those who are grieving, tend to those who are ill, bring them the love in your souls, and if you can physically embrace them and, in that moment, ask God to touch them, please do. All souls are in need of love, and what greater gift than to love them with Divine Love. As my brother sings, aloha from above, touching every heart, every soul.

So, indeed, let your light shine to everyone, rejoice in this gift, with each other. Gather whenever you can, physically and when you cannot, come here into these circles where you can let the world go and be in the healing balm of the love of God. I thank you, and with all my love and blessings, I shall step back and join you in your beautiful prayer. I am your brother in Christ, a disciple of the Master, and an inhabitant of the celestial kingdom.

I am Luke, the Physician, and your eternal friend and brother. Go in peace.
