# The Beautiful Garden of God’s Love

May 13th, 2017

Self Realization Center, Encinitas, California

Received by A.F.

 

Yes, I walk in my brother’s garden often, for this is as close to heaven as we may get, my beloveds. This beautiful condition of Love, the harmony that exists here, each soul that comes into this garden is affected, touched by this beauty and harmony. In this condition we can work and bring a blessing to each soul.

So I walk in the garden and I touch the souls that enter therein, as do many angels. It is a sanctuary just as you, my beloveds, are attempting to create a sanctuary where you live. So, our beloved Yogananda created a sanctuary where he lived. Create sanctuaries wherever you can, beloveds. Places where souls can come to be refreshed. Where they are reminded of the beauty of God’s Creation and their souls uplifted.

Blessings to you, blessings to all of us who walk in this garden this day and everyday may you walk in the beautiful garden of God’s Love.

God bless you, God bless you. 

St. Francis.
