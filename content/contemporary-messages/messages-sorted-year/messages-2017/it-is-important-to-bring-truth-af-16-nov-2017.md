# It is Important to Bring the Truth to Humanity

Â 

I am Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon religion and I have spoken to you before of my commitment, my desire to support you in the truth that you bring and know. I indeed wish to materialise to my people of the Mormon faith and to speak to these people and to correct many errors that have come into my faith and religion, some of which I taught. It is important to bring the truth to humanity and you wish to do so in such creative ways, such blessed ways. This is a beautiful venture, my friends. May you be successful and may I fulfill this desire to speak to those of the Mormon religion. It is important that the truth comes to all.

God bless you. God bless you.
