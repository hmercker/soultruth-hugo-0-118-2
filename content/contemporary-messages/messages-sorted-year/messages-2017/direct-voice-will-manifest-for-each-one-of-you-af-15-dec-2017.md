I am Lotus Blossom. I have such Love for you my beloved, beloved friends. So beautiful, so beautiful, you have become as you have prayed together in this time that God has gifted you to be in this place, this sanctuary of Light. And to come and to truly know one another in prayer and Love reaching out from your hearts, embracing all in Love. I have seen great progress from each one and great improvement in your physical bodies. You have made consistent efforts augmented by consistent prayer that has brought you many blessings and opening the door that the gift of direct voice may manifest for each one of you my friends, and it will.

I was with this instrument and showed him his body and I told him how much things have improved. And he feels greater vigor and energy. So it has been with each one of you and I have been with each one of you each day to help you and I have inspired my charge to help you as well. 

You see that you have all used your gifts to support and Love one another in this beautiful venture of Love. You must see your own part in this venture, as we have all worked together from your side and ours to bring beautiful Light, wonderful health and joy and Love and gifts into this circle. We will continue to work with you beloved souls. We are bonded now and we will not leave you, that wherever you are we will continue to Love and support, to help you to grow and become stronger in all ways. This is God’s Will and this is our joy to accompany the bright souls in this world that they may express their beauty to many, many others. And so it will be a beautiful flow, an expression of that perfect lotus blossom in your world. You are all connected in this way, petals to the flower and this shall continue and that flower shall grow more beautiful with every moment. 

My Love is with you. I have deep Love for you, each one of you. What a blessing it is for us to come to minister to our new souls in this world. A gift from God, a gift of Love. God bless you beloved souls.
