Received by Al Fike.

 

May you dance to the beautiful tune that God plays for you, beloved souls. For God will carry you in this harmonious, beautiful Light and music of the soul. The steps that you will learn will be new and surprising. Your gifts will unfold. The work shall carry you in many different directions. May your steps be inspired by God in the beautiful music He has to give to each one. Sing from your hearts, love from your souls and embrace all you meet.

God bless you, beloveds. Your friend Goldie continues to be with you as you continue to open your eyes to the Will of God and the wonderment of God and the beauty of God. God bless you. I will dance with you in this joyful recognition of the great river of His Love that carries your soul. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
