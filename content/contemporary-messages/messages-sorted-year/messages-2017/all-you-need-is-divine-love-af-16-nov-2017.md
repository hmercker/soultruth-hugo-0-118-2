Â 

It is good to hear from my friend Maharishi. I am John Lennon.

I have learned much since coming into the world of spirit. I see that you carry on the work that I initiated some years ago singing that phrase *"All you need is love."* I am very happy that I too have found Love, the true Love of God - something that I longed for and sought for many years while on this world. I have now found what I was looking for. I have found the great Truth of God's Love. 

I too wish to speak along with so many others of this Truth, to confirm this Truth to the world in this magical way, this Direct Voice as you call it. I eagerly await my opportunity to speak directly to many people in this world who will indeed recognize my voice and my face. I hope that they may find some inspiration in what I say for God has blessed me and blessed all those who gather to speak to be a part of this. Great blessings and Light are on all of us, my friends. God bless you. God bless you in your efforts. My love and my prayers are with you, my friends. Indeed you have found Love and I love you. God bless you.
