# Percy’s Passing

October 11<sup>th</sup>, 2017

Abbotsford, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

 

I too<sup>1</sup> greeted dear Percy. We embraced and laughed, knowing that we both had a good life, that it was dedicated to the Truth, the Father's Love, that we in our own ways walk this path and we continue to walk into the Light. He will join the rest of us sometime soon in our efforts to support you all in this life, to help you to clear away any obstacles that stand in your way to bring greater Light and Truth to this world. So much work awaits each one of you. Your life will overflow with such opportunities and experiences as a channel of God's Love. There is so much work to do. So many are waiting, my friends, waiting for your time of service in clear and powerful ways. There is so much work to do and we look to you on earth who are eager and prayerful, who desire to serve God, to step forward and say, "I am ready. I too wish to serve," as did our beloved friend. 

May you be humble in your service, clear in your intentions, and loving in your expression. Be true to yourselves. Be honest in your life. Do so with integrity and do not lose sight of the goal to bring more Light into this world, to allow God to bless many through you. Each has this potential. It merely waits for your acceptance and your desire, and the flowering of your souls, so that all these good gifts that reside within you may come to the surface, come forward into this world, that God may utilize these beautiful gifts for the blessings of others. If you are the instrument, then God will play a beautiful melody through each one of you. Allow this to happen my friends, allow God to express that beautiful music of Love and Truth and Light through you. 

Make Percy proud. Show him that all the efforts that he made are continuing to flourish in this world through each one of you. There is so much to do. So much work awaits. You each begin to awaken to this truth and reality, to step forward as your true selves, with strength and clear light, filled with Love. May you release all your burdens and walk in that blissful freedom, that wondrous Light in the world. God bless you my friends. I am Alec and I have been with many of you for many years. I continue to be with you, to support you, to help you to grow, become strong and beautiful. God bless you. I love you.
