Â 

I am Seretta Kem. Yes, you look to the future with many questions and you wonder what those next steps will be, how to implement what you have learned, how to express the awakenings of your souls. I say these are all good thoughts, important ideas to discover and know of the truth regarding your personal lives and movements within this world. You wonder about this gift, this gift in one way that is so elusive yet in another so powerful.

I must be candid with you, that our original intent was changed midway through the development of this gift for we saw greater potential in you as you came together. We decided to alter the outcomes of this time together, for now you have within you a more powerful gift than what was originally intended. A gift, as some of you have seen and all of you understand, that is incubating within you. It will take some time as you continue to integrate these Truths within you, to discover your soulful self and express this in your lives more fully. As you grow and mature in this way, this gift will emerge and will surprise all of you in its power and its beauty.

So you see, we cannot always foretell outcomes, as those of you on earth with the actions of free will and the influence of all the conditions of this world, there are no set outcomes, merely potentials and possibilities. So we decided to lift you up further and to bring something more beautiful to be expressed through each one of you in the times to come. You will be happy to know that the gifts of materialization, of direct voice are a part of these gifts but only one part of what is going to be a kaleidoscope of gifts within you. This is the direct result of your prayers and efforts together to bring yourself to those higher levels of soul development and Love.

Yes you are very tender and fragile at this moment. You need to go within and be with God and to be in rapport with this beautiful Light so that it may help you to come to recognize the beautiful gifts that have been given. Tender are these newborns in need of nurturing and sustenance. Strong are your souls which know to go to God for these things that are required. May the wisdom of your souls carry you forth in greater Light, deeper Love, and more wondrous expressions of your gifts.

When you are ready I believe that you will come together once more in prayer so that that which has matured within you may find expression in ways that you are aware and conscious of and will become more tangible in this world. There is always more, my beloveds, there is always more. We continue to encourage you forward to take greater steps to grow stronger and brighter and closer to God. It all flows so beautifully, my beloveds. You know how much we love you. You know that we are with you. We shall continue in these efforts of soul awakenings and spiritual gifts and beautiful expressions thereof.
Like a student in a classroom, you have come to a level of learning, of awareness. Now we can continue to teach you greater things when you have digested what you have learned more fully. Go out into the world, my beloveds, and express your true selves in Love. When you are ready, test these new gifts, test your own ability to choose Light, to be Light in this world. We will continue to be with you to encourage and inspire you, to bring our love to you. Know that God's Hand is always upon you, beloved souls, always upon you. We thank you, beloveds, for all your efforts, your commitment and your love and for all the efforts of those who supported you in this world and all the efforts of the spirits and the angels who have come together in remarkable ways and have brought about remarkable results as we continue to work together. Yes, gifts are within you, many gifts that are dormant will come to the fore. Awarenesses, awakenings, revelations, wisdom, peace, joy and Love are with you and shall continue to unfold within you.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am Seretta Kem. We will continue, we will continue, beloved souls. Do not think that you have ended, but you have completed the first step in many. God bless you, my beloveds. God bless you and keep you in His Love and Light always. God bless you.
