Â 

I am Martha. Have faith in your beautiful selves and know that many changes have taken place within you. Have faith that these changes will indeed come to the fore in your thinking and your doing in the world. For it is in your belief of yourselves of what is within you, that knowing, that awareness and that commitment that those beautiful lights within you and gifts and Love that will help you to express yourself in the world in a way that is in harmony and Light and strength and Love.

How often we are faced with choices. How often we do not think of the choice that we have made because it is such a reflexive action. We are so used to being a certain way, to live and respond to life patterned after the influences of those around us and who love us. But now in this time of your life, you have the opportunity to change all of that, to be somewhat different from what you were. With Love you can conquer all of these obstacles of incorrect thinking. With Love you will have the strength to do it. With Love it will be expressed with such beauty. Honor yourselves, my friends. Honor the beauty of your souls. Walk in the light of Truth. Be those beautiful channels for God that He so desires you to be. The Light will burst forth from you. You will surprise yourself with what comes. You are poised, poised, beloved souls, to bring change into this world, to be a channel of Love so beautiful and powerful that many will take notice. But first you must be a beautiful channel of Love for yourselves and live in such a way that will express this and bring greater harmony.

Your souls are beautiful. They shine with Light. You are beautiful for you shine with such promise. It brings the angels to joy and hope and desire that you will help to bring that wave of change to the world. May you do so, my friends, with such Love, such vitality, such commitment. You have all that you need. You have all the resources possible. May you take advantage of what is given and utilize the strength and the Love that is given within your soul to walk in this world as a Light, truly as a Light.

May God bless you and spur you forth in eagerness and joy, wisdom and Love. God bless you. Martha loves you. I will help you all as you navigate this world. I am here. I won't leave. God bless you.
