# Much Awaits your efforts

November 21<sup>st</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C.

Received by A.F.

Â 

I am Wagner, a musician of note, and a composer. I wish to bring beautiful music to this world. So many of us who were known in your world for our compositions want to express to humanity how our progression in the world of spirit has changed our music, and our creativities. We wish to reveal much to humanity, and to give in this way so that this may inspire many souls who hear the depths of our music, our compositions and are inspired to reach their eyes towards God, to seek His blessings, His Love and His Light.

You will see, my beloved souls, you will see all these beautiful blessings and gifts that will come forward. Much awaits, much awaits. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.
