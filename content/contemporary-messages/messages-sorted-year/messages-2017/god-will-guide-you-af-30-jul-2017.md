# God will guide you to the parched lands of the world

July 30<sup>th</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C. Canada

Received by Al Fike.

 

I once again come upon the appointed hour to give guidance. I was with you as you prayed together in this group of hungering souls. Many were touched and many received the blessing of the Father’s Love. I tell you there were many more spirits who were present during your prayers and discussions who were influenced and blessed than there were mortals who sat in the circle.

I wish to commend the dear daughter who taught her wisdom, who indeed is learning to be a channel of Truth, receiving inspiration and expressing such to those who were listening. As you continue to strengthen in your efforts, you will be teaching many other souls in many different places in this world. You will be bringing your gifts forward, bringing the great power of God’s Love into everything that you do for the benefit of mankind. 

Yes, indeed, mortals hunger for Truth within their souls, yet so many are distracted by the pursuits of the material. They do not know that they hunger; they do not know that there is that deep well within them that is dry and parched but yearns to be filled to overflowing. This, my beloveds, is your task. To inspire those who cross your path so that they may recognize this great thirst for Truth and Love, God will guide you and bring you to many places where you may speak your truth and use your gifts. You will continue to prepare for this wondrous journey of service. You will continue to climb to loftier heights of awareness. You will continue to increase the capacities of your souls for Love and to be a channel of God’s Love in this world that is so parched. It is God’s desire that all the parched lands of this world may be flooded with Love, that all the ignorance, the error, the strife, the darkness may be washed away with Love. Who will He call upon, my beloveds, to open the floodgates and to stand up and say: *“May these living waters flood your souls.”* 

Open, beloved souls, open to this grace that is washing, purifying and healing. That is your love, the Father’s Love, to stand up and declare that the time has come for the great flood of Love to arrive, this healing Love, the Love that shall wash away and cleanse this world of the darkness that brings parched earth, sadness, desperation, deprivation and such a lack of Love. 

You have come together in your circle of Light in joy and celebration of Love, seeing how this will uplift and bring inspiration to strengthen and to heal. So your circles will grow wider and wider, and your influence of Light will grow stronger and stronger as God guides you, as God directs you into the parched lands of this world. You will demonstrate and teach, you will walk in Light and Love, you will inspire, you will bring the bell toll that awakens the souls.

Continue in your efforts beloveds; continue to seek for the highest, to walk in Light, to not compromise in darkness, to be true to your own soul’s desires and the Will of God. We will continue to walk with you as you travel the earth and bring the waters that will bring new life to the lands, to the many souls who thirst so for Truth. 

A great work lies ahead, my beloveds, a great work that shall transform this earth. All those who are willing to walk in the name of Love and Truth, peace and harmony, will walk into these lands trumpeting the arrival of Love. Blessed souls, you are so needed. God is preparing you. God is uplifting you. God is whispering into your souls what you need to know. God is with you always. 
God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. I am with you as you continue to prepare for your work and your travels. God bless you.
