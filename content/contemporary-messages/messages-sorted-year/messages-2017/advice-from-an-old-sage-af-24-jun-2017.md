God bless you, beloved souls, I am Confucius. I have come to lend my love and blessings to you, my beloveds, as you gather together in your efforts to come close to God and to work together for your little venture in this world. I wish for you to know that I, too, am involved in this effort and I will help to bring healing and to mix chemicals, to tend to each one of you as you continue to bring more harmony to your physical bodies and your spirit and your soul. There are many who are attending to you, my beloveds, helping to uplift, to protect, to heal, to guide, to bring their love and light surrounding you. 

It’s important, my beloveds that you spend time each day in prayer and we know how easily it is to be distracted in this world, to forget about your intended routines and obligations. As you continue to pray and to be in alignment with God, you allow our ministrations to be more effective and powerful and this will build as you continue to be consistent and strong in your choices for light. Remember, my beloveds, wherever you are and whatever you are doing there is always a moment for prayer. There is always a time when you can reach out to the Heavenly Father and receive His Touch and Blessing within your soul.

You have been instructed to keep your minds elevated, your thoughts towards light, positivity and love. This is very important. You cannot fulfill a high spiritual purpose if you are not in a spiritual condition that will facilitate these expressions of love. So you are being challenged, beloveds, you are being challenged to reach higher, to be in this great flow of Love with every moment, to be prayerful with every moment, that your life may be an expression of these Truths and this Love as you step forward in this world. Indeed much is expected of you, my beloveds, and this is because you have chosen a very important task, one that will have demands upon you, not only in preparation but in execution. 

When this gift is accomplished I daresay that many things in your life will change for there will be further demands upon your time and your efforts and your focus. Many will want a demonstration of these gifts. Many will be eager to hear directly from the Angels and to see a manifestation of some sort brought through you. This will not just involve this instrument and his partner but all of you in this effort and this is not to say that your lives will be completely disrupted. No, my beloveds, but we will be calling upon you in harmony with the rhythm of your life and your commitments. 

This is in many respects an effort that requires all of you to participate in fully and completely as you are able. No one is more important than another. No, my beloveds, you are all important and crucial to the success of this venture. It does not require for one to carry all but all to carry each other in this effort. Make a sincere effort to be one hundred percent, as you say, committed to your own preparation and to the support of one another in this time of preparation. 

As you continue to give in love, so the Angels will be in full support of you and will give you what you require to fulfill your roles in this venture. All will unfold in harmony, my beloveds, as is meant to be by God’s Will and Plan. Allow His Will to move through you in your life. Allow His Love to touch every aspect of your being and your life. Do not hide anything away from yourself. Be honest, be forthright, step with courage and be bold, assured that you are walking within the flow of God. This is not a time to be timid or coy. No. This is a time that you declare yourselves to one another, to this great venture and to God. Whatever is on your mind, my beloveds, whatever fears you may have or concerns, whatever troubles you, my beloveds, speak, be heard, allow God to heal this that you may be released from any and all barriers that may inhibit your efforts together. For in this vulnerability is a great strength. In this release and openness, comes a powerful healing and a release. Thereby, you will allow a clear and beautiful expression of your soul in this world that is unencumbered by the machinations of your mind. Acknowledge those chains that bind you, my beloveds. 

Feel free to express those things that you keep buried deep within you and whether you do so to God or to one another, you will find love and acceptance, you will be embraced and healed. For as you express your true soul’s being there can be nothing but love and acceptance, a healing of the heart, an assuaging of those things within the mind that vex you, my beloveds. For peace must reign within you, each one, to be at peace and to have faith that you are completely embraced by God and will walk forward in this light, the power of His Love and Will carrying you into this world as His channels. You will speak for Truth, for Love. You will help to heal many and give to those who seek to have what you have. You will show the way and you will be used by we in spirit to point the way to Truth and harmony.

Be at peace, my beloveds, and know that we are with you always. Your efforts have stimulated a great interest in the Celestial Heavens and thus many blessings and support is given to our intrepid adventurers. May God bless everything and everyone, every effort you make and may you have the strength to overcome all that which is not in harmony. May your bodies be strong and in good health. May your spirits know peace and joy. May your souls shine in the Father’s Love and in this you will find the treasure trove that you seek to open and shall do so readily and in harmony with all.

God bless you, beloveds, I am Confucius. I bring my love, my love for you, my beloveds, and I embrace you all in this Light. God bless you. God bless you.
