God bless you, I am founder of the great Sikh faith. Thank you for saying my name (M) for this instrument had trouble saying it. Yes we have made arrangements for you to have a relationship with those who bring this religion into the world. For it is God’s Plan that all religions will come together in love. Your dear friend and servant of God understands this and will acknowledge your efforts, as you acknowledge his as you all bring greater light to this world of yours. You will meet many others, my friends, many others who are primed to bring greater light to humanity and to live the truth of love, to exemplify this truth. In time whatever error may remain in this religion of Sikh understanding will fall away and truth will reign with all those who follow this faith. 

So you must be patient my friends with those who have great and noble intentions but still carry error. For in time all this will dissipate and truth will reign pure and free in this world. This is God’s Plan. This is God’s Plan to bring Truth to humanity, to each religion, to each idea and understanding which adds something to the body of knowledge of mankind. So be open my friends to what others have to say. Take what truth you can from their words and their actions and allow this to enhance the light of your own soul. For pure truth comes from the soul. Pure truth is an expression of the soul and you, in your state of awareness and light, will truly recognize those who come to you bearing truth from their souls. This comes as you grow in this light in love. You will find your way to many places in this world and you will greet and embrace many different cultures and faiths in ways of understanding the truth in those souls that God has brought into your awareness. Walk in this world in humility, my friends, always put love before you and love behind you. Walk in the light. Walk in this world as an instrument of God’s Peace and His Love and many opportunities will open before you because God uses every channel, every human being who aspires to bring light and love shall be utilised by God to help those who are lost, those who suffer, those who are unsure and confused and do not understand with clarity the simple truths of God’s Universe.

May you be clear in your understanding, my friends, clear in love and clear in light. So much, so much is given to the penitent soul, to the soul who seeks truth, to the soul resplendent in love. So much is given. May you share your wealth and bring your truth, all in love, all in sincerity and humility, all in understanding, in knowing the beauty that is this vast Creation of God and the many variations that humanity subscribes to in its existence in this world. Come to appreciate these differences and to see that it is all part of the great tapestry of life. Add your truth like a golden thread through it all. God bless you and thank you.

Sat Nam to you, beloved souls. God bless you.
