God bless you, I am Seretta Kem. I would recommend that you think of the color green surrounding you before you enter the chamber. It will help in your adjustment to these different conditions, together with the violet color, which some of you already perceive. 

Be very conscious of your thoughts at this time, my friends, conscious of your responses to one another and what goes on within your minds, not just when you are in the chamber but outside of the chamber as well. It is very important that you maintain the very highest standard within your thoughts and within your interactions together and with others. The higher you can go in this way reflects on the higher we can go in our efforts. Do not slip back into old patterns. You are quite sensitive at this time because of what has been happening to you within the chamber and your prayers. Sometimes this triggers a reflexive reaction from your minds. I would be vigilant, my friends, very vigilant, for you do not want to draw in negative and dark energies into your being and into this group. Being lighthearted is a benefit. Do not worry about material concerns, beloved souls. If you find yourself going into that state of being, walk away and let it go. This includes the time that you are not sitting together in the chamber.

You are at a very delicate moment in these undertakings. It requires a deep wisdom and a bit of caution that you not engage too intensely in the material concerns of this world. I am not suggesting you cannot go about your business, no my beloveds, but you must do so with a sensitivity to what is happening at this time in your life. It is almost like you are in the womb gestating. A new you is being born and there is a sensitivity and a delicacy to this unfolding, this coming into being of a new part of you. The harsh conditions of the outside world will be painful at this time of extreme sensitivity. If you enter the world with joy and love and laughter, none of these conditions can truly touch you. Remember to choose this, beloved souls, to seek always for God's Light to be around you and to be in harmony. Seek harmony, beloved souls, that which will eradicate all other conditions. Seek Love, that which will resist all negativity. Seek compassion so that you do not judge, rather to love your brothers and sisters. Seek joy for this is what is meant for each one of you each day - a joyful life filled with all of these wondrous surprises and blessings.

God bless you my dear and beloved friends. May we continue to work together, seeking the highest, allowing all that is meant for you to come so that God's Love may find a constant inflowing into your souls, beloveds, a constant expansion of your souls. In this way you may integrate all of these changes and blessings and come to that full realization of all the potentials that we are now wishing to ignite within you, that they may come fully into play, fully realized and expressed. God bless you, beloveds. Seretta Kem always with you, always loving you. My beloved charges, I love you so. Beautiful, beautiful souls. God bless you. I love you.
