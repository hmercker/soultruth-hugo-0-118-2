# Always seek for the Highest Love

I wish to remind you and to reinforce the idea and effort to pray for Divine Love always. I know your minds are directed upon this project of Direct Voice and I know this is indeed required of you to be vigilant and mindful and have your desires aligned towards this wondrous effort. But remember, my beloveds, it is the power of God’s great Love, His Holy Essence that will bring about this gift in all its fullness. You may read many articles, research this phenomena, and consider the possibilities of this gift. Remember, beloved souls, that these gifts were brought forward by spirits that did not have the soul development that even you possess at this time, nor did they have the celestial angels assisting them in this effort. Nor was this manifestation especially blessed by God. No, my beloveds, this was an effort by natural spirits and mortals to bring about a natural phenomenon to this world. 

When one prays and develops their souls in the flow of God’s Love it changes every gift, it brings about a new way, an opening, a manifestation that may have similarities to these natural phenomena but are different in many ways and as you already realize there is a higher goal, a more spiritual purpose to what you are about to embark upon. If this is to be of the highest then you must continue to pray and to redouble your efforts in prayer, to receive the Divine Love. Indeed, you may ask that God may develop the gift of Direct Voice within you and the earnestness of your prayers will bring about a powerful catalyst for this development.

Do not underestimate the power of God’s Love within you and the light that is generated amongst you as you in time will sit for this gift. Always predicate whatever you do with the desire of God’s Love to flow into your souls. Do not allow these ambitions to cause you to digress from this primary focus and goal. For without this desire, this soul-felt longing, what you will develop will be merely a physical manifestation, a phenomenon which has been brought forth at other times by others in this world. 

Is this your goal, my beloveds? No. Your goal is to bring the truth of God’s Love to mankind and the very foundation of anything you do in this regard must be Love, Divine Love, the Highest Love. As your souls blossom in this Love, as you continue to receive more of this Blessing, as you make this an important part of your preparation, you will find that there will be changes within you. You will open the door for we in spirit to help prepare you, both physically and spiritually for this venture. Much will flow in the way of guidance and support, love and encouragement. 

You must, through the enactment of the Laws of Attraction and Rapport and Communication, bring forth the highest, seek the highest and have a deep desire within you for the highest. It is that dedication that will bring forth the highest of all manifestations, the greatest of all gifts, the transformative power that comes with the Father’s Love as it touches everything in your life and everything within you. Those gifts that you long to develop will be touched by love in a deep and profound way. You will see as you progress upon this particular path how important and crucial this grounding in Love is and how it is also important to be humble and not overly focused upon results in this effort. Instead, to have faith that all is guided by God, that you are merely enacting God’s Will and in so doing expressing your own soul’s desires and in so doing God manifesting gifts through you and about you in this world. 

I am not suggesting that you are derailing yourself from the Divine Path. No, my beloveds, you are clearly upon this path. But it is important to realize the efforts that you make spiritually affect the efforts and the spirits that are around you, the end results. Do not put the cart before the horse, beloveds. Put your communion with God, the flow of His Love within you, as the very highest of aspirations and all else will follow in beautiful harmony.

Thank you for listening to me. You are blessed to have the beautiful spirit, the Celestial being of Seretta Kem by your side advising and teaching you in this regard and I will continue to come and supplement his teachings with my encouragement and love. Others will do so, as well, for we are all engaged as you are, as a group to bring about the highest and best results. It is important to realize what must come first and foremost in your lives. In this life, these material conditions it is so often easy to be distracted, to be waylaid to a degree. God always puts you back on the right course as long as you are open and willing to be guided and I see that you are and eagerly so. So, may you continue to walk this Divine Path in a straight and direct way that you may reach your goals swiftly, that your instrumentality may be effective, powerful, beautiful and that all will be touched by love.

God bless you, beloveds. I am your teacher, Augustine. I am ever by your side and I love you. God bless you.
