# There are no differences between us

November 18<sup>th</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C.

Received by A.F.

Â 

I am Solomon of old. I too support you in your work and wish to speak to the people of Israel. Much needs to be said. Much needs to be demonstrated to all peoples in this world. For as one climbs higher into the heavens, Truth becomes simplified. There are no differences between us - no religion to speak of - merely the glorification of God in the expression of our souls, the Light that emanates from us, the purity of our beings and the grace in which we live. Such blessings exist on high in the heavens of the Celestial Kingdom. In this we will bring our Light and our Truth and our Love to all peoples of this world.

God bless you, my friends. I am Solomon. God bless you.
