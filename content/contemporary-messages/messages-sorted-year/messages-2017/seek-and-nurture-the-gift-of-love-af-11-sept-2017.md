# Seek and Nurture the Gift of Love

God has given you a great gift. It is for you to accept this gift, the gift of His Love. For in order to receive it, you must acknowledge it. You must ask God to place this gift of His Love within your souls that it may flourish there and continue to flow into your hungering souls. This gift is one gift that shall never leave, never diminish. It may be forgotten if you so choose, but as long as you keep the lamplight burning within your soul, the awareness of the Father’s Love, it shall comfort you for all eternity, my beloveds. It is the great gift of the Father’s Essence, the Love of His Soul given to your soul. Do you wish for this gift? Do you pray for this gift? Do you long for this gift? For without a prayer and a desire, an opening of your soul to God, it cannot be received. 

So my beloveds, you continue to seek the Truth, to long for healing, to be free of your concerns, to let go of those conditions which bring pain and worry and judgement. In this gift comes the dissolution of all those conditions that are part of the human condition. You are freed, you are blessed and healed. You begin to know great joy within your very being. So indeed, my beloved souls, the key to your happiness, of deep joy, of knowing God, comes with this simple prayer: Father, open my soul that I might receive the gift of Your Love. Bring me close to You that I might know You and in so knowing You, know myself better, that true self, my soul. 

It is so simple my beloveds, so very simple. Yet for many of you, it is hard to do. You get caught up in the daily concerns, a condition of this world, your own inner condition. You fall to a place of greyness and mediocrity where you might have a great joy, a great excitement, the acknowledgement of the presence of God within your consciousness, your being. Surely you wish this gift to come to you. All it requires is to put these other concerns aside, to accept the gift of Love and to nurture this gift within you that you may continue to bring the Light within, to bring it forward into your consciousness. 

This powerful Light of Love, the beautiful Touch from God that is here for you now, my beloveds. Drink deep, drink deep of these living waters that you might truly know your Heavenly Father Who longs to be known by you for He knows you well. He loves you beyond measure. He is truly connected to your being. It is for you to discover this, to accept and know it with every fibre of your being, every aspect of your consciousness, the very depths of your soul. So we join you in prayer and continue to exhort you to seek the Love of God, this blessing that is for you to ask and seek and know. May you do so with humility and grace, faith and trust in your Heavenly Father.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Augustine, Bishop of Hippo and your teacher. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
