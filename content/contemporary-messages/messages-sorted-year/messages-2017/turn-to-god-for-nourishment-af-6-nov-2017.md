God bless you beloved souls, I am Andrew.

So few truly turn to God in a way that God can hear them and respond accordingly. Many have a fleeting thought, a distorted idea, or an image that is not altogether true of who and what God is. God is Love. God is Love.

For all those in this world who suffer from a deprivation of Love, may they come to know the Source from which they may be succored and blessed with Love. God's Love is available to all. It is there for the asking, my beloveds. It is there for the asking, to ask God to infill your soul with His Essence of Love, to ask God to bring peace, to uplift, to bring the wisdom and the understanding that comes with the awakened soul. So few know where to turn, yet they have a yearning within them, within their souls—a yearning that is rarely acknowledged but is still there. For when one lives a life bereft of God, there is a sense of emptiness, a hollowness within, because the soul lacks what it needs to be nurtured, to come alive. Instead there is a sense of not being aware and alive, the eyes of the soul are closed and the sense of the soul does not come to the mind so much is lost in this lack of recognition and understanding of God. So many out there in the world are suffering from this very terrible malady. They are lost in darkness, they are lost because they do not know how to come to God.

My beloved souls, beautiful souls, show the way, be the example, express your love in the world. Be a Light in the world. Allow God to shine through you in His Love to all you meet. In Love there is acceptance, there is an embrace of Light and peace and harmony. Nurture this within yourselves with your prayers, with your desires to walk in this world in this Light of Love and to be true to yourselves, that part of you that is truly you, your soul. Make every effort to understand your true selves, your soul, and to open your soul to God to make this holy communion and connection with your Creator. All else will flow from this, all else, many blessings, many opportunities to serve, to bring Light, to bring wisdom and to bring comfort to others comes from this simple desire and expression of Love to God.

May your souls be filled at these moments of prayer. May you truly understand what it is that your souls desire and seek earnestly to fulfil these heartfelt desires within so that you may truly know that you are loved by God. Let the power of God's Love bring His Harmony and Peace, Wisdom and Light within you. It does not require great rituals, many books, words, lectures from others. No, all it requires is your reaching for God with sincerity and earnestness. All flows from this, such great blessings. It is all within your grasp, beloved souls. Seek and it shall come. Ask and you shall receive. Have faith and Love shall build within you as a mighty torrent of Light and Love. 

Blessings to you, my beloveds. I am Andrew. I love you. Be Lights in the world beloved souls, and much will come in its stead. God bless you. God bless you.
