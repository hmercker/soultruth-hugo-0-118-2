God bless you precious souls.  This is Confucius.  You have come together my beloveds to bring light into your souls, to bring love to one another, to come and be in this blessed circle filled with souls who recognize light in all its manifestations, who seek God in many different ways, who have understandings and cultural beliefs and ways of worshipping God that are different and unique.  Yet do you not all feel that you are part of one family, one precious family in the light of God’s Love?  

Beloved souls, this is how the world must be; this is God’s Will and desire that all the peoples, nations and cultures of the world come together in love, respect and appreciation for one another, to acknowledge the differences as something precious and beautiful.  For is not the world a diverse place filled with many creatures, many beautiful creations, many peoples, many ways to view the world?  When you come together in this way with a simple prayer to God, you create a great portal of light that comes into your midst bringing many blessings and bringing many angels and love.  Drink of these living waters, the Love of God and seek to be at one with God.  For every soul has a unique path to God.  Every soul has a choice of which path to take and you my beloveds, beautiful souls of God’s creation, have chosen light and are seeking the precious touch of God and you have each taken a unique path to this place to come together in this way. It is in your souls drawn together, a deep desire to share in love and a deep desire to be with God, that you have reached out to one another.  

Yes, it is the law of attraction  as that light within your souls draws other souls, as that light within other souls draws you and you come together in this way acknowledging and being together so that you may forge these bonds of love that will indeed last for all eternity.  You are bonded, you are together and the memory of this day and all the days that you are with one another, that you support and love one another, that you take the hand of your brother and sister and say I love you, you are precious to me.  

When God brings you together in this way, you are in this blessing and light and brought up into the realms of light and joy.  How joyful we in spirit are to see your beautiful lights coming together creating a powerful light in this world – a light that God can use to touch many souls; a light that draws God’s many blessings into your soul.  As you continue to come together in a circle of light - a beautiful co-mingling of your soul light – so you will indeed attract many others and make a powerful beacon of light that will draw the hungry souls, the souls who are open, the souls who are thirsting for love.  Continue beloved souls in your quest to be with your kindred spirits, your family in love, as it grows and continues to be touched by God.  As you continue to shed any and all things that restrict and bind you and restrict your love for one another. As you grow in this light, so you will embrace many, many souls from different cultures, beliefs and understandings.  For what is within the mind has very little bearing upon this great law of attraction where upon our souls are drawn together in loving embrace and acknowledging the power of love – the beauty of love. 

 God bless you beloved souls.  Continue to seek the light together, to share your gifts and to share your love. God will always be there and this great portal will grow in beauty, light, power and grace, enveloping you all and expanding into the world … bringing blessings to many.  God bless you.  Confucius loves you beloved souls and will continue to be with you as you pray together and are in this loving fellowship allowing the light to flow and the love to grow.  God bless you, God bless you.
