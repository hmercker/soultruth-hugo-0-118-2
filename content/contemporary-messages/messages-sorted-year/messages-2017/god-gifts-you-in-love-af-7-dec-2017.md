Â 

I am Seretta Kem. So do you not see how God sends His brightest angels to your midst to uplift you and encourage upon this path in this work? God gives you all that you require, every gift, every drop of Love, all the knowledge that you require, all the understanding of your souls. God's bountiful blessings are upon you, beloveds, to carry you forth deeper into this work, deeper into your souls, deeper into the Light so that you may be well prepared for what is to come.

Continue to seek with the intensity of your souls, to long for deeper awakening, greater Love and greater joy. For when you work in the flow of God's Will there is joy, there is harmony and there is Light. You know this, my beloveds, you feel it. It is the sign that you are indeed upon the path that God has designated. Continue to acknowledge your efforts, to love within yourselves the beauty that God has created and to love your brothers and sisters for all of this, all of these efforts, all of this work is done, is given so that this world may know greater Light and joy and harmony.

God gifts you, my beloveds, so that you may bring Truth and Love to humanity. This is your desire. You have chosen this path and this work because you love your brothers and sisters so and you love this world and you love God. May your souls continue to expand in this Love. May you continue to awaken and in this awakening to release all those conditions that hold you from God. It shall be so, my beloveds, it shall be so. God bless you and keep you close to Him. God bless you.
