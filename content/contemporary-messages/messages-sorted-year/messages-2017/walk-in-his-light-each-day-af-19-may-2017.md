My name is Laila and I lived many, many years ago in this world and I am now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. I want you to know, my beloved friends who reside in this city, that I work with you and I am helping you to form your little band of Light, your circle of Love. Do not worry as to who will come to your little circle. God will guide those souls who are earnest and who are seeking the Love, the healing and the relief, comfort that comes with these prayers. To form this little circle is to bring a blessing to many others, for you stoke the flames, the Light together that will warm many souls who are close. God will add His blessings to many as you pray earnestly for this gift and blessing for those you love, to the many who are connected to each one of you who are a part of this circle. There is no need to worry about numbers, only of commitment and a deep desire for the Father’s Love and its healing Touch upon you, and upon many. And so these little flames are being ignited around the world, one of many, one of a multitude. You need not worry my beloved, but follow, follow your guidance and walk in Light, walk in Light and be in peace one day at a time, one day at a time. I will be with you, as will many who desire to work with you and to help you with your ministry. God has a Plan. All you need do is listen and walk day by day with a desire to be a channel of Love, to do His Will, to be His Child in Light, to pray for His Love, to walk within the footsteps of the Master. Keep it simple. I will continue to be with you. Pray for my assistance and I will be there. You will know me in time and we will be good friends on this journey of Love. God bless you.

My name is Laila. And I lived in what you call Israel and I followed the Master Jesus when he walked the earth. God bless you. He has asked me to be your protector, to assist you in your work. It is my privilege and honour and joy to do so. God bless you, God bless you, beloved soul.
