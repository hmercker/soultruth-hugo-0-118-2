I am Albert Einstein. What you are doing is extremely interesting, my friends. I find this fascinating. How the laws of physics are used to bring this about is quite a revelation. Now that I am in the world of spirit and have studied many more laws of Creation, I have the qualifications required to assist you in these works and efforts and I have been invited to join in this effort. I am very pleased to have a place amongst these beautiful spirits, revered and filled with Light.

The world is vast. God's Creation is complex and beautiful to behold. So much is unknown by mankind on earth. So much can be shared by we in spirit who have continued to study and to grow in our awareness of the things of the universe. Mankind is upon a precipice and has the choice to fall back into darkened conditions far worse than what you experience at this time in this world or to forge ahead to make the choice to change and to seek the fellowship of man. This is done with the power of Love. The most powerful energy in all the universe, my friends, is Love - that creative force, that force that can bring about harmony. It is time for mankind to discover and to utilize the power of Love for in this science will come many answers to the dilemmas of humanity.

I wish to work with you, my friends, to work with all who wish to bring a change to this world. For change is what is required. Change not only given through knowledge but change given through the opening of your hearts, the opening of your souls to discover these aspects of yourselves that are so unrecognized in your world and yet must be opened and acknowledged and expressed so that the world may come into balance. In this way the life of every human being might be revered and acknowledged in Love. In this way so many problems can be solved. So much can be expressed and come to Light.

So I commend you, my friends, I commend you for your efforts, for what you are attempting to do in this world. So much hinges upon fellows like yourselves who are taking a radical approach, something different in order to find solutions for humanity. This is what is needed - to step forward with a new perspective, new ideas, to acknowledge the power of Love and to utilize the power of Love in your own lives. May there be a new world dawning within your lifetime, my friends. A new world full of optimism and wisdom and knowledge and Love. For with these things a new world can be built, a world that is more in harmony with the laws of God. May you be successful. 

I will continue to do what I can from my side of life in co-operation with many who are working with you to bring about this gift. Some progress was made today and some of you felt a difference in the condition and power in your circle. There is nothing to be alarmed about. They are utilizing energies that you are not familiar with and will feel somewhat foreign. But this is required. It is like tasting a dish that you have never tasted before, using elements that are not familiar to you. So it will be like this, a sense of something different, something unusual. But in this way you are discovering much, experiencing a whole new world, a whole new understanding - the powers of Creation, the power of Love.

Carry on, my friends, carry on. May you be blessed by God in everything you do. I am Albert Einstein and I am with you. I am with you. God bless you.
