# Bridge Differences With Love

God bless you. I am Joshua. I have come to speak to you about the differences in the world.

These instruments have traveled the world extensively and have experienced for themselves the different cultures, attitudes of their brothers and sisters that inhabit the various parts of this world. At times I think you feel overwhelmed by these differences. It is difficult to comprehend the variety of thinking, the cultural expressions of the various nations of this world. One tends to gravitate back to what is comfortable and familiar. Thus there is a sense of distance and a lack of connection with those who are different though these two instruments have been bold and open in their travels. They have brought Love where they have been and connected with many individuals even when language is a barrier. Love continues to bring a closeness, acceptance and a warmth. 

As you continue on as instruments of God's Will and comply to His Plan you will meet many individuals of different cultures and ideas for there is a vast variety of expressions in this world. The mind is capable of such variation and complexity of expression that one could not know it all in one life. But God will ask you, as time continues in your life, to reach out to many, many souls in this world not just those you are familiar with in language and culture, but also those you are not. It will require a sense of adventure, an eagerness to come to know these individuals whose lives are so unfamiliar to your own.

What bridges the gap here, as you reach out to others? It is Love. It is the power of Love that closes the separation, the sense of unfamiliarity and the lack of verbal communication. It is Love that all can understand. And so as you continue forth in your travels and efforts be aware, beloveds, that it is the Love that shines from your soul that will light the way and bring a sense of togetherness with those you meet.

I acknowledge that you do not fear other cultures. No, this is not within your nature as you continue to grow in the Father's Love. So, if there is a sense of fear or reticence this falls away with the power of Love, for you begin to recognize that every child in this world is your brother and sister. You are all family of God, His Children created with such diversity and in this diversity is such beauty, such an overwhelming amount of creative expression. You begin to see how God in His Expression creates such diversity, such complexity in His Universe. With the eyes of the soul you begin to appreciate and become aware of this profound beauty in the complex expressions of humanity.

Yes it is easier to be drawn to those who are familiar. It satisfies the mind, it brings a sense of wholeness within you as you reach out to others and are able to speak and to share in intricate ways. Yet what is the most powerful and important way of communicating? It is Love. Another may forget all of your words, even your appearance, but if Love is given, this is never forgotten. A Light has been gifted to another, a Light that can be obtained and nurtured within, for God uses your Light to inspire other souls. God uses you as a channel of Love so that He may reach other souls in a way that has a clarity and a familiarity that triggers a chord within that individual and their souls.

God sends you forth into the world so that you may be used to touch many souls in this world inhabiting many different places in this world, for your world is a very complex place filled with many languages, ideas, cultures. Yet each individual that lives in this world has a soul and that soul is not reliant upon these fixtures of society. No, a soul knows, understands from the perceptions of the soul, those innate abilities of the soul. You are sent forth to ignite a curiosity, a sense within those souls that there is something important shared and given as a gift, as you are God's channels of Love and God works through you.

Thus the invitation to come to the Heavenly Father to receive His Gift of Love is given in this wordless way filled with Love and Light. So my beloved friends, do not hold back because some individual is unfamiliar to you with their thoughts, their language, their appearance and their culture which is so different. All of these things in comparison to the soul are superficial and you are learning the language of the soul, my friends. You are learning how to communicate in this other way. As you are more familiar with this communication, of soul talk so to speak, then you become very effective ambassadors of the Father's Love in this world. As the Father's Love grows within you, you emanate a strength, a Truth, the Love in a way that others are aware, certainly within their souls, what you bring with your presence. This is a gift, a gift that comes with the power of Divine Love and the awakening of your soul to speak the words of Love, words that are wordless, expressions that are pure, emanations that flow through the air and touch others because you have allowed a channel to open within you. To allow God's Expression of Love to flow through that channel, to touch other souls, to ignite a desire within them to receive this gift. 

As you greet all those that you meet with a smile, a glint within your eye that says “I love you”, you do the Father's work. You carry the Truth and express it beautifully in these simple gestures as you touch another and say “you are my brother, you are my sister’”and you walk in the world knowing that God is guiding you, protecting you and you are escorted by angels.

What a magnificent journey you are upon, my children, what a wondrous adventure, as you continue to know yourselves so truly within and express the gifts that God has given you, the Light that is within your soul. You will touch many others, often without even knowing. But because you carry the Light and express it with every breath you cannot help but touch others. 

Every soul is seeking this Light, this comfort, this Truth though their minds may be unawares, their true selves have been touched in a powerful way. This is your goal, beloved souls, to walk in the world as a clear channel of the Father's Love, to express this in every part of your being, who you are, and as you do so, you create a new culture, a new way of being, something that will model the Truth for others. Though at times you are challenged and you do not feel in that flow of God's Love, that great River, you are indeed there. It is a matter of putting aside those human things and living within the reality of God and His precious Love. Thus, the salvation of the soul is what will attract many, for a soul that truly is transformed by God will have powerful impacts in this world and though each of you are upon this journey and are gradually awakening and transforming, you must have faith that what is now alive within you will be expressed in beautiful ways and will inform your journey.

I am Joshua. I have been mentioned in the Bible and I inhabit the Celestial Kingdom. I am an angel of God with a redeemed soul. I am happy to be with you, as I am one whom your band of angels wish to introduce to you. I shall continue to be of service to your efforts, your desire to bring Truth to mankind. God bless you, beloved souls, God bless you and keep you in His Light. My Love is with you. God bless you.
