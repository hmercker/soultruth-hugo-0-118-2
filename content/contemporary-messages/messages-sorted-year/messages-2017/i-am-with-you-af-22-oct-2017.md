Dear Heavenly Father may your great love settle within the souls of these dear brethren, these beautiful children andthat all gifts, small and great, be theirs, all Light beautiful of Your Soul be blessed upon them that they may be protected always, that Your guidance may be clear as you whisper within, that Your Will may be expressed and become truly a part of their will, that there is such harmony between you and such love abounding and flowing and healing and loving. 

You will know that you are truly with God, beloved souls. Be with your Creator in these times of great effort and intense longing. The blessings of the Heavens will truly be yours. May you be carried and cared for and brought into the embrace of God in ways in which your doubts will fall away and all your worries and cares may be no more, beloveds.

I am Jesus. I love you, beloveds. You are my brothers and sisters. I love you deeply for I feel your love. I know your love. I acknowledge your Light. We are children of the Father's Love and shall always be for all eternity. We belong together for we know within our souls we belong to God. God bless you. I am with you, never to leave, always with you. God bless you.
