I am George the Sixth, former king of England and I wish to join in my fellow friends in encouraging you. I too, wish to step forward and bring a message of peace and truth to the world. There are many who were people of fame and power who are now in spirit who wish to pull together and bring a blessing to the world through God’s Help and Blessing. 

Carry on my friends. There are many observing you and assisting you in this effort.

God bless you.
