Greetings from spirit, my friends. I am Alec Gaunt and I once attended these meetings when I was on earth years ago. My daughter-in-law sits here. I greet you, dear and beloved daughter.

I am now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. I found the Truth of Divine Love years before I passed into spirit and utilized the Truth within books that were published by James Padgett bringing the Truth of this Love into print for the very first time. I want you to know, my friends, that Love is the currency of the world of spirit. Without Love you cannot progress. It is important to take this matter into account when you are in this world because the more you can progress in Love, whether it be your natural ability to love or the expansion of your soul with God's Love, you will find your place in the world of spirit that is bright and beautiful. It is the power of Love, my friends, it is your capacity to love, to give, to be expansive within you that will bring you to a place of deep understanding in your spiritual pursuit. Make sure that everything that you do is predicated by Love. In this you will find great rewards, not only in this life but in the next.

If it is the Celestial Heavens to which you aspire, then pray to God to receive the blessing of His Divine Love and it will be given in accordance to your efforts and prayers. If you aspire to go to a beautiful place in this world of spirit, be a good and moral soul. We all know what is right. We all know that our actions must be for the good of all. Use that sense within you that knows what you must do to bring harmony to your life and to this world. 

God bless you, my friends, and may you come to know your true hearts, that place within you that longs for Light. God will bless you and put His Hand upon you and the spirits and angels in Light will come close, assisting you as you grow spiritually in this world. May all the blessings that God has to give to you come to you, my friends. I bless you too. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Alec. God bless you.
