I am Aldous Huxley. You know me from the books that I have written and my vision of the future that I lay down in these pieces of fiction. Unfortunately my vision is all too accurate, maybe not so dramatic in its expression but certainly many are blind and have been indoctrinated into ideas that are counterproductive to life. So, I too lend my support, my love and my efforts to help you to bring greater Truth to this world, to break the chains, the chains which bind so many. To free up humanity so they may come to know their true selves, what they are capable of that is so beautiful and magnificent. Every soul has great potential. Every being is full of creativity and possibilities. This is the message I wish to give if I have the opportunity to speak with Direct Voice.

Yes there are many through history that have seen the Truth and have tried to express it in many different ways. We will see how creative we can be in this regard, with this venture. Many possibilities lie ahead, my friends. I lend my heart and my understanding and my love to you. You forge a new road for humanity, one that is not altogether new but is so misunderstood by the masses. You must bring the Truth in clear ways that will attract the interest of humanity. So many of us will make great efforts to do so, to try to inspire your brothers and sisters in this world so that they may see a different way, a different road to take and that they may do so without fear and worry and care that they will be lost without their old ways and life. For humanity needs to go boldly into the Light, into Truth, to come to recognize reality rather than to rest within this dark place that has been forged by those in power and control of the world. Truth needs to be set free my friends, and that can only be done with Love, with clarity and with passion.

May you continue to discover your own true selves, to express your unique and wondrous beings and to do so through the blessings of God's great Love of which I continue to pursue and to be a part of, this great flow of Light to the world. I am with you. I pray with you as you pray for His love. So I pray. I continue to seek the Truth that comes with these revelations of God. God bless you, my friends. God bless you,  God bless you.

**Note**

Aldous Leonard Huxley (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and philosopher. He wrote nearly fifty books — both novels and non-fiction works — as well as wide-ranging essays, narratives, and poems.

By the end of his life, Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the foremost intellectuals of his time.

Huxley was a humanist and pacifist. He grew interested in philosophical mysticism and universalism, addressing these subjects with works such as The Perennial Philosophy (1945) — which illustrates commonalities between Western and Eastern mysticism — and The Doors of Perception (1954) — which interprets his own psychedelic experience with mescaline. In his most famous novel Brave New World (1932) and his final novel Island (1962), he presented his vision of dystopia and utopia, respectively. (Source: Wikipedia)
