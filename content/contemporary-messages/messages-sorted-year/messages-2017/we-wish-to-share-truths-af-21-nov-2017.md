# We wish to share these truths in beautiful ways

I am Elizabeth Taylor.  I too wish to join my friends in speaking about the glories of God and the glories of this world of spirit and all of the many things that humanity seems to not be aware of or understand. So much needs to be shared with humanity. I know that when those of us who were known by many of you come to speak, there will be many who will listen. That is the plan to help others to understand, to be open to what we have to say, to share these Truths in beautiful ways, creative ways. I will join you in this great venture, this great experiment that you have embarked upon.

My love is with you. I have been watching keenly your progress. Thank you for your efforts. Thank you for everything that you do to try and bring our world and yours closer and the Truth and God closer to humanity. My blessings to you, my friends, my love, my love. Continue, please continue.
