# Accepting the Differences

Â 

Gob bless you, Alec here. I find it amusing that you have invited in these beloved souls (Sikh followers). My amusement comes from my own biases when I was in your world. I felt uncomfortable around those who were not of the Christian faith and I had judgement towards those blessed souls. Now that I am in the Celestial Heavens I see those of the Sikh religion, those of the Muslin religion, those Buddhists, those of many different religions that some possess the Divine Love within their souls and some do not. It seems that the conditions of the mind do not automatically determine whether the soul will receive this gift. For as you know, the soul and the material mind act often differently.

With the Law of Attraction you will draw in souls from many other religions and ideas that are drawn to you, are drawn to this Light and this Love. Something within them brings them to your doorstep. This will happen more and more as time goes by. I applaud your openness of thinking and your desire to embrace many, for this is what is needed in the world. This is what will bring Light to the world, Love and acceptance, not judging those who think differently from yourself but embracing all as children of God.

In time these differences of thinking will dissipate, and the Truth will come forth for all of mankind and all those in spirit. This too is part of God's plan. So you make these tentative forays into the different worlds of men in a desire to reach out in Love. This is indeed the expression of your souls, to be open, to be a brother and a sister to all your brothers and sisters. This brings Light and this brings greater harmony. I know that you will enjoy your time together with these precious souls. It is a gift from God, is it not? It's a time of putting aside any ideas that may inhibit reaching out to another and to accept and love, to be relaxed and open and hospitable. God will bless you all as you come together. It cannot be any other way than this for when you have souls of Light commingling together in prayer and discussions, you draw the Light. There is always Light.

May you find God's blessings in your day of the morrow and find happiness in this experience and true connection and the bond of Love. God bless you, my friends. I am joyed at your efforts, at this loving gesture. God will bless it all beautifully and abundantly. God bless you, my friends. I am Alec and I love you too. I love you dearly. God bless you.
