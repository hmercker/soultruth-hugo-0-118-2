# Rumi Speaks of Direct Voice

November 15<sup>th</sup>, 2017

Received by Al Fike

 

I am Rumi and I feel such profound love for you and your efforts to bring Truth and beauty to this world. My heart soars to see such beautiful lights. I wish to come and recite my truths amongst this world once more. To bring Truth through my beautiful words and my love and my compassion. For so many in this world do not understand the Truth in any way that is useful and that will bring forth their gifts and their beauty. 

I walked the Divine Path. I did even in the beginning, and it gave me many profound insights and visions. I learned the meaning and the Truth of love. I am humbled by what you are doing my precious, beautiful friends; to sacrifice your life in this way to bring greater love and truth to mankind. It is what will bring change and deep healing to many. You have no idea of how many from my side of life support you and are praying for your success. There are many who wish to speak through you with direct voice. Our wish is that this may be so, that you may be successful, that your gifts may bring enlightenment to the world, as you are a Channel of God, of His Love and Truth. May God bless you upon your travels. We will be with you. So many, so many wish to bring greater light to mankind. God bless you beautiful souls, beautiful souls. God bless you.
