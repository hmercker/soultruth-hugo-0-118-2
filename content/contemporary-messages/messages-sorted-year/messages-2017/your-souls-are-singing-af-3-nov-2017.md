God bless you beloved souls. I am wanting to give you instruction for we are entering a new phase in our development together. And it is important that we discuss these matters. I wish to explain what it is that is happening within this circle; as you enter that place of development and opening to this gift of direct voice. You have made a great deal of progress beloved souls. A great deal of progress in bringing harmony amongst yourselves and within yourselves. This has been your goal for the last several days and you have accomplished this very readily. And I wish to congratulate you on this accomplishment. 

Now we enter a new phase of development. This phase has many more physical components although you have experienced a number of sensations and energies as you sit in this dark room, many more now will come into play. Much will be happening with your spirit bodies. You are each connected very closely in this regard and in this way we may transfer chemicals one from the other and when this blending comes, we spin these energies and chemicals together amongst you. It is like a big ring of energy that connects together each of you from your chest areas through to each other. You may have a sense of vertigo from the intensity of this spinning energy. 

We are engaging your physical bodies as this is a physical sort of mediumship. I would suggest that you drink water before you enter this chamber. This is helpful to keep the body’s cells in good order. As this instrument has read a set of instructions, which I gave a few weeks back, it would be helpful to review this document as much of what we will be doing will be laid out in these instructions. A new set of helpers will be engaged with you at this time. There are many spirits and angels who will be working with you. Many of these things are very technical and cannot be explained at this time, but some of you may see these procedures. Do not be alarmed. And what is very encouraging is the fact that you have built a condition within this room that is beautiful and very effective as we continue this work together and to come close to you my beloveds, as this is important. We may speak to you in this way but there is a greater rapport that is required to work with all of you together and to do so with consistency and do you not feel that you have settled in to a condition that is uplifting and comfortable for each one of you? Those modulations of feelings and emotions, thoughts now are tempered to an evenness and an uplifted state, which makes it easier for us to work with you all. 

We will now be using the instruments on the table and I would make a suggestion that you put something that will glow in this darkness, so that you may see the movements and the manifestations that happen with these items. It will not be a long-lived procedure using these implements on the table, but it is one phase which will help us all to see the progress that we make in this physical world. Our ultimate goal is to move beyond this sort of mediumship to something that may be used in broad daylight and may be used at anytime amongst you. And this of course will be the most difficult step. But we see now that you are fully committed, that your souls are singing in the Light of God’s Love, that you feel the momentum building within you and all around you as your group joins together in harmony a unison to be with God, to be in this Light and it is this Light, these emanations from God that will bring these manifestations forward amongst you. As you continue to be open to receive the blessings of the Father’s Love, so all is energized by this gift from God. All is unified by Love. Those differences in your personalities are not so important, are they? For there is a great unity within your souls my friends, a great unity of Love, of consideration, of acknowledging the beauty within and that beauty reflecting to one another. These are the conditions that we seek beloved souls in order to work together and develop this gift. The power of Love, the power of Love expressed, the power of your minds in harmony with one another. This is what uplifts and connects you with God and with we angels who are working with you. 

So many things will begin to happen in this little circle. You have come to that place where we begin. Begin in earnest. Begin with a sense of anticipation and excitement that you may truly accomplish this task and come into the flow of God’s Will for you and His Love for you. That destiny that awaits each one. 

God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. I apologize for interfering with your quiet time, but this instrument is more effective at this time than in the evenings, so it is easier for us to speak. We take advantage of this time and I thank you for listening. God bless you beloveds. God bless you.
