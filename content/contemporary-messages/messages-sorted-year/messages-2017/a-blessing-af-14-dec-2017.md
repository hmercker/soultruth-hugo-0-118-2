Walk in this Light beloveds. Walk in this Light together, in this glorious Light and Love, and those that carry this Truth will be mightily blessed in this world, mightily blessed with all manner of gifts, great power and Love will be yours my beloveds.

May you walk within this Light always, and you shall be accompanied by the angels with every step. Great Truth is yours my beloveds. The power of God’s Love continues to transform your souls and bring you to that place of true knowing and harmony. Step forward and claim your purpose, what you must do in this world for God, and it shall be given in full measure, in full measure my beloveds, it shall pour upon you, be expressed through you and bring the Will of God to this world in surprising and beautiful ways.
