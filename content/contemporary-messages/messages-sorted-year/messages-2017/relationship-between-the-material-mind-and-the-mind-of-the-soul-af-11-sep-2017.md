# Relationship Between the Material Mind and the Mind of the Soul

I am Leytergus. I was a philosopher of old, in the ancient times, long before Jesus came to this world. I am now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. I have come to talk on the subject of the relationship between the soul and the mind, that is the material mind and the mind of the soul. These are two distinct entities within one individual.

The soul exists before the incarnation of the individual into the material form. The mind develops and grows from this incarnation. It is a faculty of the individual required to sustain life in this world for that individual. For every creature in this world, the material world, has a form of mind, some indeed very primitive and, of course, in the higher animals, more complex. But it is a requirement of life to have these mental faculties of the material mind which assists each individual to navigate this life, to reason, to perceive, to understand the nature of reality in this physical plane.

Yet the soul, that other part of yourselves that brings a different reality, a different understanding, is often neglected in this material world. For in your times, your culture, the mind reigns supreme and determines the parameters of reality to such a degree that the soul and its perceptions and understanding is lost. Yet you, beloved souls, seek to know your souls, to expand your souls in the Father’s Love, to understand those faculties within your soul, to discover the mind of your soul. 

In this search you encounter the dilemma of bringing the consciousness of soul and the consciousness of the material mind together in a harmonious way. It is your challenge. It is difficult because of the dominance of the material mind. Yet you persist, you pray, you are given guidance, you are surrounded by the heavenly angels, and you are connecting in a conscious way with the Heavenly Father, the great Soul of God. As you continue to do this, your soul begins to awaken and that consciousness comes closer to your awareness in your everyday affairs. It does so because the soul is enlivened by Divine Love, awakened by this great energy and substance of God. 

For those who are not awakened in this way, the soul does find its place in relationship with each individual in time, not necessarily in this world, in this life, but as life progresses through the spheres of spirit, it eventually reaches that place of perfection in the sixth sphere. There is an understanding in the soul, limited, because in these efforts to reach the higher planes, all that can be accomplished is the purification of the soul, the nurturing of the natural love within that soul.  Still the mind, which often at this point is the mind of the spirit, continues to dominate and dictate the reality of existence for that individual. The blessings that you have with the awakening of the soul through Divine Love will in time far surpass the capabilities of the mind of the spirit. For the mind of a spirit is limited and cannot go beyond a certain point of understanding. Now, if you could understand the capabilities of this mind and this reality, you would see that there are indeed many potentials, capabilities, inherent in this mindful condition. It would be hard for you to reconcile that this is a limited condition of awareness for you are not so far along in this progression of awareness. 

Yet it is so, we in the Celestial Kingdom observe the limitations… (recording ends prematurely)
