May the Grace of God be with you, my beloveds…

Wherever you walk, may His Light shine upon your path. When you speak, may the Light of Truth pass through your lips. May your souls shine with the Father’s Love, that that Love may flow in great abundance and that this blessing of Love may be a constant inflowing into your souls, beloveds. May you be used to bless many others as you have been blessed. May those blessings flow forth from you – lights touching lights, lights bringing comfort to the darkness in this world.
Blessed are the peace makers, blessed are the light keepers, blessed are those who seek Truth above all else. You are blessed, beloveds, you are blessed in Light.

God bless you. I am Jesus.
