May the Father indeed bless your souls. May you come to know that longing that resides deep within you as the guiding force in your life, that you may continue to tread that path to the Fountainhead of Love. That you may walk in this Light and hear the whispers of God’s Will within your souls. That you may continue to serve God and Love and to open your awareness to the great reality of God’s Creation and Presence and World. This wondrous World of God, this World that sweeps you up out of this human condition into a place of deep harmony and peace, where you forget so much that is not of God and be aware of the great Love that is for each one of you, precious souls, gathered up into God’s Embrace.

Feel this Love envelop you, beloved souls, recognize that this is where you are meant to be, in this Grace of God’s Presence, in the flow of His Love as you continue to journey upon this path, towards at-onement. As you do so, you shed that which burdens you, that which you no longer need, because your needs are being filled by the Heavenly Father. 

You begin to recognize the power, the sustaining force, the healing comfort, the great transformative powers of God’s Love. Many of you have prayed for this Love, have walked this path for many years. You do indeed recognize that this Love is what you seek and need. It is your comfort and your joy; it is your challenge and your fulfilment. It brings much to you that cannot come from any other source. You begin to deeply recognize that this is indeed your life’s journey and purpose, to seek at-onement with God, with the Touch of His Love. There is no greater blessing, my beloved, no more wondrous a journey as you feel the thrill of your soul’s awakening, your eyes opening, your consciousness blossoming in this joyous Love. 

Continue to seek this blessing, beloveds. I, your teacher Augustine, will journey with you as will many from the Celestial Kingdom who accompany you each and every day as you continue to struggle, to long, to pray for greater Light and Love within. God has you well in hand, my beloveds. You will not stray off this path, no my beloveds. You will continue on your journey and the openings of Truth, the blossoming of your awareness, as God continues to embrace you, will change you my beloveds, and will make you a clear and beautiful channel of His Love. You continue to strive and stride towards Light and God continues to guide you henceforth upon your journey of awakening. So you acknowledge the wonderment of this journey, the necessity of receiving this gift of Love in order to sustain you upon this journey and bring you to where your souls long to be, in at-onement and harmony with God. 

So it shall be, beloveds souls, as you walk in Light, so Light will increase and carry you and heal you and envelop you. Beloved souls, you are precious in God’s Sight. See yourselves as children of God, truly know this, believe it, embrace it. All other thoughts that do not include this reality, let them go, release them to God. Say: *“I am no longer this child lost in the judgments and messages that I have received from others. I only want the message of Love, the Touch of God to be my truth and my reality”.*

Father, bless these souls, who continue to journey towards you. Sweep away all that is in their way and holds them from You. Embrace them fully as they continue to seek at-onement.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher Augustine. I have journeyed many miles with many of you, my beloveds and I will continue to journey with you all as you seek Truth and seek at-onement with God. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds and I love you. God bless you.
