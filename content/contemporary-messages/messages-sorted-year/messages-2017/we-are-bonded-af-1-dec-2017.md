Â 

God bless you beloveds, I am Jesus and I come to bring my message to you, to bring my love and to tell you of God's Love. This mighty blessing washes over you, my beloved souls. The living waters of God's Love is washing over you, refreshing you, changing you as His great gift pours amongst you, overflowing and flowing out into this world this Light, this beautiful Light reaching many who are indeed in your lives or connected to you in some way.

You have become a channel of the Father's Love as His instruments. In your prayers and your thoughts, in your deeds, may you continue to serve God in this way and allow the waters to flow through you to many. For as you allow this channel to open within you, pure and beautiful, more of these blessings flow forth, ever more as this channel deepens and widens, as your soul comes ever closer to the Heavenly Father, as His Love continues to bring its blessings to you. So you will walk in the world, beloved souls, and bring this Light. The power of your presence is the power of God's Presence within you. Allow this Touch to infuse every part of your being, every aspect of your souls, all of you, my beloveds, all of you in harmony with the Laws of God's Love. For this will ignite you upon a journey of service in the world bringing the flame of Truth to many. You will serve as your gifts open, as all the potentials of your soul come alive with this Holy Touch from God.

May the Holy Spirit continue to touch your souls. May the Hand of God be felt by each one of you, beloved souls. In this you will know deep peace, great wisdom and eternal comfort as His Love brings you more fully into the Light. May harmony be what you seek and express in the world, deep harmony that comes from a soul infused with Love and the mind of the material in harmony with Truth. In this, harmony ensues.

You are carried, beloved souls, you are carried. You are my brothers and sisters. We are eternally bonded in this great journey to at-onement with God. I walk with you. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus. May God bless you deeply and carry you forward in the Light. God bless you, beloveds. I love you. I love you.
