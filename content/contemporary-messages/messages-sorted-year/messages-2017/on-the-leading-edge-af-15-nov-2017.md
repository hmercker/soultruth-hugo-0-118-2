I am Lao Tzu. I was a Chinese philosopher of some note in history and I wish to speak to my people with direct voice. I am known in my country and I will be recognized, as will those whom you know already and who work with you. They will be known. You will indeed travel to my country and bring this Truth, this Light. The wisdom of old comes from God. Our perceptions of God are different and our culture is different from yours, but we all have a soul and within that soul is the capacity to understand one another in ways that do not engage the mind so much. This is what we will teach: “To look to one's soul to find Truth and in this seeking, you will find God and HIs Love.”

We are working diligently to help you upon this road and this journey to bring Truth to mankind. You will come to know us and many, many others who seek to serve as you do to bring the Truth to mankind. You come close to opening the flood gates my beloved, beautiful souls. You come close. We feel great joy and anticipation of what may come from your efforts. The world will change. The world will respond to the Truth you have to bring. Is this not your desire beloved souls? To bring greater light and change and wisdom to this world. To teach all those who you encounter the power of prayer and the response that comes - the Love of God touching the soul. Many will understand this profound message, igniting many deep changes in this world. For this world must change and will change. 

Much is coming to an end in the world of man. Much is coming to a new beginning, igniting something profound within humanity, something truly profound and beautiful. You are on the leading edge of this change and thus you are precious souls, pearls beyond price. God guards you and keeps you safe and will do so no matter what chaos may come in this world. You will be kept safe and God will use you to bring truth, to calm the troubled waters and bring peace. Much lies ahead my beautiful friends. Prepare yourselves well. Know what is truly in your heart. Be close to God and support one another as you all grow in this light. My blessings to you. My profound desire is for you to be successful in your efforts. The world so needs what it is that you may give, for you are listening to the profound Truth that comes from the Soul of God. Continue to listen, to allow this Truth to grow within in you and manifest like the flower coming with the sunshine of the Father's Smile upon you. You are deeply blessed beloved souls, deeply loved, cared for and nurtured. Make good use of what is given. Do not squander your treasures, but use what is given for the benefit of all. God bless you. I am Lao Tzu and I stand with you in love and deep respect for you all. God bless you.
