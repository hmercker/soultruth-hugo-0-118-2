Â 

I am Guru Nanak. My son, the Lord shines upon you in your efforts. You continue to serve God. Remember to keep your eyes and ears open to the Truth, for God feeds you a rich bounty with each day and will show you the way, beloved son, and will open your eyes and bring you to greater Truth as you continue to seek the guidance and the understanding that comes from the Source of all. His Hand is upon you. God graces you mightily, my son, and you shall be guided always and in His Light until the end of your days. You shall teach and walk this earth as His servant. Your life will be long, my son, and filled with many more travels - travels within your soul, travels within this world meeting many souls, many who will seek your counsel and your blessing.

And for all who are here, seek the Truth always and bring Love into all that you do. Do not force upon another your ideas. Merely share your experience, your truth from your heart. Give your life and love to God and God will guide you so. God will show you the way to raise your light, your presence to God and bring you to that place of great peace and simple Truth.

You are blessed at this time and you shall continue to be blessed as you seek Light. Go with God. Sat Nam. Sat Nam.
