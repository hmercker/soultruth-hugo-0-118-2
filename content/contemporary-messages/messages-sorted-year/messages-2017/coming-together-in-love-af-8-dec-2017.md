Â 

We will indeed join you in your celebration tomorrow to bring the beautiful souls together in Love. The excitement and anticipation that you feel comes from the beauty of your souls knowing that although the perspectives may be different, the souls are the same in Light. This is what you must focus on, my beloved, beloved friends, to be loving and accepting, to speak your Truth plainly, to extend your hand in Love, to open your arms and embrace these beautiful souls who are earnest seekers of Truth. They have come to know a Truth and have come to live a Truth that is of Light.

May you learn from one another and enjoy the company of other bright souls in this world and feel the joy of this friendship, to recognize the Light amongst you and to sing your praises to the Heavenly Father in joyful acknowledgement of the diversity of life and the wonderment of each soul in this world.

God bless you, my friends. Yes, I continue to be with you. I am always with you, my son. We are bonded for all eternity. God bless you, keep you in His Light. I love you. I love you, beloveds.
