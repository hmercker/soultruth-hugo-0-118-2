# Your Prayers Touch Many

October 12<sup>th</sup>, 2017

First United Spiritualist Church, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike

 

I am Seretta Kem. May the peace of God's Presence be with you always as it is with you now. Your prayers for healing for those you love, and those who are part of this church, and many connected to you in many ways have gone forth touching many souls.  

Please continue in your prayers as you gather together in this circle. Continue to put forth your desires, your longings to God and for blessings for those you love, for this world. For this world needs your prayers. In this place, this place of Light, God can use your prayers to touch many. You not only pray for yourselves but you pray for many more souls, most of whom you do not know, but these prayers bring Light and comfort, peace and healing to many in the world. 

So you do a great service for God because you come together to seek His Love, to create a circle of Light, to know His Love within your souls, to feel the peace of His Presence, and the joy of His Touch upon you. May you continue to be blessed and grow and be a channel of Love in this world. You will come to know the joy that your dear friend (Percy) who has just passed has come to know, for those who serve are doubly blessed. When one receives Love, one must give Love. May you do so with every breath, my friends, for this world has a deep need for those who know prayer and the power of this gift.

God bless you. May His Love find a constant inflowing into your souls and may you know the joy that comes with this gift. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem. I too love you and am with you often. God bless you.
