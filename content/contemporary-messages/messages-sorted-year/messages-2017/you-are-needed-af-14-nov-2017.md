It is Churchill, Winston ChurchilI. I too stand with my brother (King George VI) in an effort to bring sanity to this world. You are needed, my friends, you are needed. Don’t be afraid to step forward, to step up and speak. The truth needs to be spoken and you need to encourage all of you in this world to change your ways, to bring something more equitable and closer to harmony. The world has become a chaotic place and I realize now that I helped to bring this about through my errors and ideas. I wish to make an effort to correct these. Although I am not of the Celestial Heavens, I do indeed pray for God’s Love. I understand it now and I am working and progressing towards that place of redemption and at-onement with God.

All who will be speaking through you will be in alignment with this Truth in one way or another and this will be the most important message given. We will make an effort, those of us who still have a keen interest in the affairs of the world, will be helping to bring clearer knowledge to mankind of the ways of this world and how they may be changed and brought into greater harmony. Of course it is up to those who listen to you to accept, to believe and to act. But we cannot continue to stand by and watch the world degenerate into such darkness. God has called upon all of us to work to bring greater light to this beautiful world of His Creation and to bring sense back to humanity. It is a big job, a very big job, requiring strong and competent souls who are willing to step forward. God has called you, He needs you, He needs all of us. Be strong my friends, and may we all work together in harmony to bring the truth to mankind, truth that they will understand, truth that will bring solutions to the world that has gone astray. I will stand up with you and speak to my people and to the world along with my brothers and sisters who will bring the light and the truth to humanity. God uses us all in many different ways, bringing the help that is required. 

God bless you, beloved, beautiful souls, my friends. God bless you and may you be well on your way to bringing this gift to humanity. My prayers are with you. God bless you, I am Winston Churchill. God bless you.
