Greetings my friends, I am White Cloud. 

The time has come for all of you to stand up and speak the truth. You cannot continue to allow those who are bringing destruction to this mother Earth, for the purposes of power and wealth, to continue in their actions desecrating God's Creation. You must all stand up my friends and speak the truth and speak of love, speak of what is needed to bring healing to this world. To heal the lost souls who are in great pain, to heal all the peoples of this world who are confused and lost and suffer so, because they do not understand why they have the gift of life, and how God has given them the opportunity of life in this world. You must speak the truth, my friends. Speak it from your hearts. Speak it from that place deep within you that knows. Do not hold back but be strong, stand your ground and as the Great White Spirit whispers into your ear what must be said, listen my friends, listen and act upon the wisdom imparted to you. For you must impart this to others. 

May the Love of the Great White Spirit infuse each one of you. That light growing within you dispersing all that is dark, bringing all that is in harmony and beautiful and pure. Each of you has a purpose in your life, something God has asked you to do, something that is clear within your soul. Come to know what this is and convey the wishes of God. 

God's Truth is simple. God's Truth is for everyone. God's Love is the greatest, most powerful healing of all. Let this Love flow. May this Love flow through you touching many others, and with this great comfort and healing will come and wisdom will flower within you, bringing to you the knowledge of what you must do in this world. 

I am with you my friends and many of my brothers and sisters are with you in this effort to bring peace to this world, truth to mankind, healing to all. I am with you. My blessings are with you. The light of many are with you. The truth of God is within you. Speak with strength and clarity, humility and grace. All will flow, all will flow as you open to the wishes of the Great White Spirit, your Creator, your God, our God. May you be blessed my friends. I am White Cloud. I am with you. God bless you.
