Â 

It's Goldie! I have spread pixie dust on you with flowers at your feet. I have kissed each one of you. All the angels have come to touch you with their blessings. Each one has touched you and given their blessing and what gifts they have to give to their special charges.

We will give everything to you, my beloved souls, that we can. May you be open to these gifts and may you look to God for all that He has to give. For you are now blessed deeply and carried into Light with profound and Holy Love touching your souls. May you continue to be in this glorious Light, way above the conditions of the world. Hold onto this Light, my friends. Hold on and be with us in this glorious place of Love.

You will be carried for these few weeks and nurtured and touched deeply. Everything is yours for the asking. May you be deeply blessed, my beloved friends, and know the great joy of God, the Father's Love. God bless you. God bless you.
