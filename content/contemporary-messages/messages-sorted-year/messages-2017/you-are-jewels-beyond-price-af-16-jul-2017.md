I am Seretta Kem. Yes, you continue to adjust your metabolisms through your diets. This is good, beloved souls, this is good. We already see a difference within each one of you. There are more changes to come within your physical and there will be a beating of the light within your soul, like a heartbeat, bringing vibrancy and strength and light within all of you. Each will feel this somewhat differently but it is a gift that we will implant within each of your souls as you open and blossom. You continue to progress and your light grows and gifts will open, beloveds, gifts of perception. They already begin, you feel waves of insight and emotion, of understanding and knowing. This can only grow as you continue to progress. Seek the Love, seek to be in greater harmony. 

Yes, you will find that there will be attacks from unexpected places. I wish for you to know, each one of you, who are a part of this circle of 7, that you are firmly within God’s grasp. You are protected, you are accompanied at all times by the angels and you are in the light. It matters not the opinions of others. What matters is the opinion you have of yourself. The strength and power of the faith you carry as you listen to God’s Will and walk in this light, the light of His Love. Each of you knows the path that you are on, certainly within your souls. It is time for you to cast aside all doubts and know within your own being, the consciousness of your mind, who you truly are and where you are going and why. Why are you doing this, beloveds? Ask yourselves this question. Ask your soul, ask God. Why? Why do I walk upon this path? Why do I feel drawn to do what I do, to pray as I pray, to desire to serve as I so desire? The answers lie within your souls. The answers lie within the power of God’s Love that draws you to live in this way and be in this loving harmony.

You continue to feel compelled at times to be drawn in to self criticism, to looking at yourself as if not measuring up to what is asked of you and what is truth. Beloveds, you live in this world and are human. You cannot expect to be an angel overnight. No, my beloveds. It takes time, it takes growth, it takes purifying of your souls, it takes growing of the light within you. It takes a great deal of prayer and longing to receive that deep and eternal blessing of His Love. 

You have indeed taken many hours and hours of prayer, fervent prayer, and at times you feel as if you have not made any progress whatsoever. I tell you, beloved souls, if you could see the light within you, you would know that those hours were not wasted, those times of prayer have saved your souls from darkness. Now comes the time when you will recognize your own light and feel the joy of your own soul’s progress in God’s Love. This progression, as you well know, continues for all eternity. It is a never-ending journey into joy, into at-onement with God. You must have patience, my beloved friends, and tolerance for yourselves, acceptance and love and as this grows within you, you will feel greater tolerance, acceptance and love for those around you. As the inner judgments fade away, the outer will go with it and you will be free and joyful. When you touch another, the love will be felt by the beautiful soul you are touching. When you gaze upon the children, they will feel your love. When you walk with your companions, they will trust you. When you do service, God will Touch each soul you are ministering to. This is the power of God’s Love. This is the beauty of His Touch as it works and flows through you, as it changes you, changes your perceptions of the world, changes your understanding of life and enhances your capacity to love in every way. It is God’s gift to you and all of humanity. It is the saving grace, it is the gentle touch, it is the peace that passes all understanding. It is God’s greatest Gift. My beloved beautiful souls, you have received this Gift and now it is time to honour this Gift, to acknowledge it within you and to release all doubts, all that which inhibits your appreciation and understanding of the beautiful soul that you are. God wants you to feel the joy and acknowledgement of the beautiful soul that He created, a gift to the world, a gift to the universe, a jewel beyond price. 

Be at peace, my beloveds and let the Father’s Love permeate everything you are and everything you do and all else will follow in harmony. God bless you beloveds. I am Seretta Kem and I love you and we will finish our little talk today. Thank you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
