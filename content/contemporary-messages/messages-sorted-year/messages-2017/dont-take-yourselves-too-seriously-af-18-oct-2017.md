We are very excited too!!  I am Goldie!!!
Don’t take yourselves too seriously, my friends. Just pray to God that He will use you in this lovely way to bring more Truth to the world. With the joy in your heart and your souls glowing in Love and faith, you will accomplish your goals. Be harmonious together. There is no need to differ in your opinions for within your souls you are all in harmony and in agreement. This is what’s important. The details will work themselves out as you progress in this great effort for Direct Voice.

It is the joy in your heart, beloveds, that is important. With Love everything is possible. With Love everything will come together in harmony. We shall celebrate our mutual efforts in the times to come. Give thanks to God for these great gifts that He has given all of us to bring further joy and Light to this world, a world so in need of joyfulness, lightheartedness and Love. That’s what you will give to the world, my friends, a gift of joy and a gift of Love. Be in joy and be in Love and be close to God for God is pouring His blessings upon you as never before. Drink everything in like a big sponge, let it all be absorbed and know that you are on the right path. A destiny awaits, a destiny is sure to be as you continue to make these efforts in Love.

I love you. I’ll be with you. You will hear me sing in Direct Voice. God bless you. I am Goldie. I love you. I am overjoyed. I love you so. God bless you.
