My name is Gene Kelly. And I am with many of my friends in spirit - Danny Kay, Barbara Stanwick, Lawrence Welk and many more. They are eager and they watch your progress for we all want to bring joy and Love to humanity. There has never been a time where this is so needed as now. People have lost their spirit for life and go about their business with so much gloominess and stress. There is so much unhappiness in the world. And when my compatriots and myself sought to entertain humanity it was to bring a bit of joy, a bit of Light and lightness to those in the world. Now there is a deeper need and a deeper message that needs to be spoken and demonstrated in many creative ways and we desire to bring this Light and Truth to the world. 

There are millions of us in this side of life who wish to do this, to bring this Light to the world. For as we see humanity continues to lose its way, to misunderstand the meaning of life and the purpose of life. We all wish to make an impression upon our brothers and sisters who walk your world, to inspire and uplift them so that they may make an effort to seek the Light and to come to know their Creator, their God who Loves them so.

We stand with you and your efforts - there are many, many of us who stand with you my friends. May you open that door of Light, let it shine into your world, bright and beautiful, uplifting and bringing Truth and Love to many souls who are now lost. But something in them craves the Truth, craves to be free and craves to awaken. We in spirit will try to inspire in many creative ways so that those who are lost may find a glimmer of Light, some hope, some Truth. 

May your efforts be blessed my friends. May you have a song in your heart and lightness in your step, and joy, joy - express this in your life. It is so important to be lighthearted, to be loving, to live a life that is joyful but deep and full of rewards. For who can be downcast when God has His Hand upon you. For with Love comes joy and with joy comes more Love. It’s never ending my friends, it’s never ending. God bless you and may He keep you close to His heart and may your heart sing with a joy that He puts within you. My Love and our Love goes out to you brave souls willing to do something different, something more in harmony with the laws of God. Keep up your work, be strong, be bold and walk in the Light always. I am Gene Kelly and I know the Love of God in my soul. God bless you my friends. God bless you.
