Beloved daughter, you do indeed have a role to play in the efforts that these individuals have dedicated themselves to the development of the direct voice. When this gift is accomplished, there will be much work and many opportunities to bring this gift forward to the world. There is a necessity for those who are willing to help support these instruments in their efforts and in their travels. There will be times when you too will travel with them and be part of this group. 

You have many gifts my daughter. You have a clear vision, and you are also very capable of dealing with the material concerns of this world. These abilities and capacities are very important, so that all may run smoothly and effectively in this plan in an effort to bring forth these Truths. Your role will not be just in one capacity, but in many, and we will not disturb the rhythm of your life too much, for there will be times when you are engaged in other things and other times you will be called upon in this service. I believe that you already feel that calling within your soul. l you know this to be true. You feel an excitement, an anticipation and this is always an indication that it is Divinely guided, when one has this sense of knowing and excitement. When God calls you to service, all is in harmony and will flow beautifully. 

There is no sense that you should be concerned that your life will change dramatically, for it will not, but it will be an added component, an opportunity in your life that will bring fulfilment and joy. There are many more opportunities waiting for each one of you as the momentum builds, as the plan becomes more set in this world. We cannot anticipate every move and every possibility to come. Yet we do have a vision of the flow and direction of these efforts and we are already working with others whom you do not know at this time who will be involved. In time there will be a good component, a number of people who will be working together in this way. This requires organization, an understanding of how you may all work together in harmony and effectively. Each will contribute something to this plan, so that nothing is missed and all is taken care of. 

There is much work to do – a great deal to be understood. As you have been guided, go more deeply within your souls, so that the inspiration may come forth and the guidance be delivered clearly to your consciousness. You may work without confusion or hesitancy, but with a surety and a strength that comes from your soul, expressed through your being and with the potency and the strength expressing your leadership, your knowing and your gifts. This will fall into place beloved souls and it is coming very soon. 

I would ask you to focus on this in your prayers, in your thoughts and to be open to the guidance and inspiration that is coming. For much is meant to come, much is meant for you to know. This is a dynamic time, this is a time of formulating and preparing and seeing clearly the direction in which you must go. And I’ve said each of you are capable and have gifts to share. May you see clearly your own purpose, what you are meant to do, and see that this is exactly the right thing for you, in harmony with your light. God works in this way. His plans are perfect and your place within it is perfectly suited to what you are and what you have to give. This is how the Heavenly Father works. All is in harmony, all in perfect time, all very, very purposeful. May you see this beloved souls and come to acknowledge your place in this beautiful flowing of Light and Love and Truth. May it all be within the Will of God, expressed in harmony, His plan for the salvation of mankind, so desperately needed in this world.

You each have a part to play. This is a joyous thing, to know you may serve God in such a beautiful way. The rewards will be great my beloveds. The work will be intense, but fulfilling. You will be called upon for many things. Be humble, accept and be true, to what you know within yourself is right, beloved souls. May God bless you abundantly and keep you in this Light always. Know that you are loved. You are never alone. All will be well. Take life one day at a time, beloved souls and each little part of the puzzle will fall into place. God bless you, I am Seretta Kem. I will continue to support and guide you in this great venture. God bless you, God bless you.
