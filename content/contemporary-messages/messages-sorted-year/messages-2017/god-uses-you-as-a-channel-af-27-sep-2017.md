My daughters and my son, I am with you, and I am Mary. I am joyed to see you all loving one another, joining together in harmony and seeking to serve the Father in loving ways, supporting one another in these great efforts to bring the Truth of God's Love to humanity. The time is now to speak up and talk of Love, the power of Love, the beauty of Love, the miracle of God's Love, for so many are lost in this world and so many are confused and distracted by the earthly conditions. My beloved souls, you have a Truth that is so valuable it is priceless. You have a knowledge and the experience that few understand or know of and you must share this with others in whatever way you can. Often it is wordless, it is a look, a smile, something in your eyes that says, "I love you." God uses you as a channel of His Love, brings His Touch and His Holy Comfort to others through you my beloveds. Remember this, every moment may have within it the opportunity to touch another soul, to bring comfort to another, to bring the Truth of the Father's Love, inspiring another to set forth in prayer to receive this gift. 

May you walk in the grace of His Love always and know His tender Touch, uplifting and counselling and healing and ministering to you and those around you. For as you pray for your own soul, you bring the touch of this Light around you and it grows and spreads to many others. You will continue to serve God my beloved, beautiful souls and the angels will accompany you. There is much to learn yet, your souls to expand in love, your eyes to open to the Truth and your heart to love God more fully. Yet with each day, you continue to grow in the Light as you pray fervently to God and much is given and you will come to that place of conscious and profound union with God. To be touched in this way will change everything as you come to accept the transformation of your soul and the awakening that will inform your journey in this world. 

So, it comes. The flow of His Love continues to spill within your souls, bringing you the peace that passes all understanding, the joy from deep within and the wisdom which God implants within you with His Love. So it goes beloved souls, so it goes, one step at a time, one effort, one choice, one prayer and all falls into place slowly but surely as you find your way. I am with you. I love you dearly, beloved souls. I am with you and we all journey to God. We are all children of God and we each love God. This lights the journey and brings the awakening. God bless you beloved souls. God bless you. I am Mary and yes, I am with you. I am with you. God bless you.
