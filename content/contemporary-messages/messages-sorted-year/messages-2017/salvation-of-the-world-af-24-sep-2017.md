# Salvation of the World

God bless you, my beloved children, I am Lotus Blossom. When you speak of the salvation of mankind, you must also include the salvation of your world, for it is not only mankind that suffers, it is every creature in this world that suffers from the imbalance and from the conditions that mankind has brought to this planet as many choices are made in this world that are contrary to the Laws of Creation, and bring suffering.

The plants, the animals, the creatures of this world are sensitive to the energies created by mankind. The physical conditions mankind creates are in an attempt to bring more material comfort to themselves and thus stripping away the many resources in this world, leaving the land barren and polluted, and creating such serious imbalance. This ripples out to many places on your planet as your climate changes and your seas become sterile, and the land burns and the wind blows, and the rain lashes in a tempest that will inevitably get worse as you continue to bring your influence to bear upon the natural order of this world. So when you speak of the salvation of mankind, you also speak of the salvation of this world. God's Will is that harmony is to return, not only for the benefit of you and your brothers and sisters, but the benefit of all the animals and plants and creatures. The oceans and the air and the land all must come into harmony before true salvation can be. For mankind cannot continue to be blind to their own affects upon this world. 

Many are aware, we know, and are making the efforts to bring greater harmony, but to do so with great wisdom one must have soul development, soul wisdom. One must be in rapport with the Great Spirit, the Soul of God, so that He may endow you with great and profound wisdom, Love, and understanding. So you see there is a great effort afoot to bring those conditions that have caused such pain crashing down, to make way for something that is in alignment with God's Laws of Creation, in alignment with Love, in alignment with wisdom. So many walk this world who are blind, who cannot see, for they continue to find the distractions of this world more important than harmony within their soul.

God does not wish for His children to be in deprivation in any way, but when one is in harmony within one's soul, the material desires dissipate. For the spiritual fulfillment brings about a greater harmony and less hunger for material wealth and comfort. Yet each soul has basic needs in order to survive in this world and to live a life that brings about a spirituality that can be accessed. It is not intended that one's sole purpose is to survive in this world, because the extent of this deprivation does not allow one to pray or think of anything but the desire to eat, to be warm, rather to have a life that has a certain amount of comfort and where these needs are met. So it is not the desire of God to take away all that which is required by each physical being in a world which requires certain necessities. But if man does not moderate his desires and seek a life that is filled with harmony and wisdom, then God will ensure that these excesses are no longer available and cannot be obtained through greed and a deep desire for power and indulgence of the flesh.

So one way or another a harmony will be obtained in this world. It is the choice of mankind whether that road to harmony is done so through the willingness of each soul to seek it or there will be a great struggle to adjust and be a part of this intended harmony and Light in the world. Of course each soul has free will. Each soul can choose and some will choose a difficult path while others will choose an easier path. This is the way of life. God gives you a choice. But as you continue to grow in the Love of God and see for your own eyes that which is not in harmony with His Love, yet you continue to live a life that is contrary to Love, you will suffer. You will suffer because you resist change and you resist God's Call to change.

We do see you changing, beloved souls. We see greater wisdom within you. You are strengthening. Your eyes begin to open. The Love begins to flow more freely. You seek greater Light, a deeper communion with God. This brings us great joy to observe how you continue to struggle forward and upwards to greater Light. We continue to stand by your side in loving efforts and support and prayers for you, my beloveds. We wish to help every soul in this world who struggles and make efforts towards the higher consciousness and awareness of the laws of God, the laws of harmony and the laws of Love. And you must, as you continue to grow, share your wisdom and your love with others, for how else will things change in this world if not by those who are willing to set an example, to be strong and clear, yet compassionate and loving? As your souls grow, you continue to set a higher standard for yourselves to make those choices for Light, to allow the consciousness of the soul to enter into your mind and allow you to truly understand God in all His Facets and His Creations and His Laws and to seek His Love above all else.
If mankind set about this task of knowing as you have in your life, oh, how this world would change! How different it would be. But it must start somewhere, my beloveds. It must start with each individual soul seeking the Truth through prayer and efforts to know God. I know many feel all they must do is go within themselves and go no further. This does bring a certain peace and awareness of the higher self but it does not complete the picture, the understanding that must come.

So you, my beloveds, seek the entire Truth and though this may not come very readily nor within your lifetime in this world, you will gain much in Truth and awareness and Love as you continue as you are, praying and seeking God and His great Blessing. So the salvation of mankind will come with the salvation of each soul and the opening and dawning awareness within them reflecting in their actions, their desires and their efforts. We continue to nurture those who so desire Truth. We ask you, my beloveds, to also nurture those who desire Truth. The greatest power that you have, beloved souls, is the power of your Light, the power of your example, the power of your Love. This we ask you to express freely, confidently. With each day may you continue to love and cherish all those around you and be a channel of His Love, a clear and bright Light and channel for the world. 

Momentum will build towards this great salvation, this coming change in the world. As you grow in your strength, your faith, your love, your perceptions and gifts, so God will use you in many, many ways, ways you cannot imagine but are coming. Allow God to guide you, influence and inspire you, beloved souls. So you will continue to step forward, continue to grow in your awareness, continue to love and continue to grow in harmony with your world, the world that God created, the world that is meant to be.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Lotus Blossom. I am glad to speak to you today. I love you. I am a part of this great effort for the salvation of the world. I love you. I am with you. God bless you.
