# Be Full of Joy

November 29<sup>th</sup>, 2017

Oh, you are all so serious. You work so hard, you are so diligent in your efforts. And I know you want to make the world a beautiful place as do we. But for the flowers to bloom and the sun to shine you must laugh and be joyful. Not so much worried and concerned but to let go of your fears and your concerns and allow the joy of God's Love to infill you and overflow where you cannot do anything but laugh and smile and say “I love you, I think you are beautiful”. I think you are beautiful, beloveds. You are beautiful, each one a beautiful flower of God in His wondrous garden of souls. 

May you find a lightness in your step, to dance in joy, to laugh, to laugh, for God wants His children to be joyful and free. That is His desire for every one of His beautiful souls. Let go of all that which burdens you, my beloveds. Be free, free to sing from your heart, to dance, to smile, to see the world as it really is, beautiful, God’s beautiful Creation and to see each other, what beautiful souls you are. What beautiful souls you are.

May your vision increase, your eyes of the soul open wide so that you may embrace the joy of His Love, the wonderment of His Creation, the beauty which is within each one of you. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Goldie and I love you.
