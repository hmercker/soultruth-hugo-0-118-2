It is your friend Seretta Kem. I too have come to speak to you upon the appointed hour. Is it not a great blessing to have the Master Jesus come to you, to lend his love and support to your efforts? He does know you beloved souls, each one. He knows you and he loves you. He has referred to the events of this day and I wish to comment as well. 

You see the love that you brought into that place (FUSC), the conditions that were built in that small gathering, are the conditions that you will be required to carry with you on your travels as you spread the news of the Father’s Love in this world; those conditions of love, the deep desire that this blessed couple had to bring this news to those who came. The power of the light that was within your souls combined with the preparations and development that will ensue as you sit together for direct voice will ignite the manifestations which you desire to see and share with others. 

So, you must be strong, each one of you within your hearts, within your souls, within your beings and desire deeply to love and support one another in harmony, to put aside any conditions of doubt and that which is unloving. For within the minds of each one of you there is harboured some judgments, some preferences and biases that can easily ignite negative thoughts and energies and open the door for negative forces to work through you and cause disharmony. We know that none of you intentionally desire to do this, but you do live in this earth plane and you do harbour some of those conditions that are dark, that are inherent within this plane. 

You must be vigilant, beloved souls, and monitor your thoughts. Monitor your actions as you live your daily lives. Be loving at all times. We have implored you and instructed you and in order for this venture to be successful, it requires a deep discipline and commitment and this requires your efforts on all levels. Indeed it is apparent that you are making great efforts in many ways: efforts to change old patterns of thought, even of dietary habits. You must see that each of you engages in certain diets of thought of the mind, patterns laid down for many years and responses honed by years of experiences and interactions in this world. We are not suggesting that you change everything within you. You cannot change your personality and your inclinations to a great degree, but it does require that when you fall into negative thoughts, that you to choose to halt this pattern and to interrupt it. If you find this difficult to do, ask for help. Your angel friends are always by your side willing to assist you. I am not suggesting that you need to second guess every thought. No, my beloveds, but there are times when you are well aware that you are indulging in conditions that are not harmonious. So, in this world it is very easy to slip into negativity. You do not have the benefit of living in the celestial heavens where conditions are beyond your comprehension and reinforce all that is good, wonderful, harmonious and loving. No, you do not have this benefit as of yet and so we understand that your condition and your efforts will not be perfect, that you fight against a head wind and at times it gets the better of you. What we are saying is that you must fight. You must forge ahead. You must do so with awareness, sensitivity and eagerness to change, to redirect your energies towards more positive thoughts. I am not condemning you my beloveds. No. Your light and your conditions are exceptional and beautiful, but if we are to work together in this close and intimate way you must reach for a higher condition in order for us to come closer and work together with such efficiency, vitality and precision that we will be able to accomplish the changes we need to make within each one of your bodies and your spirits so that we may bring about these manifestations of direct voice. 

Yes, it is a challenge to bring this gift through on such a high level. It is exciting as well. Think of what you will accomplish by making these small changes within your being. Walking in this higher way in life by being joyful and positive, and reflecting this towards yourselves in enthusiasm and indeed a confidence that you will invoke higher ways of thought and being within your lives. You have all the resources available to you, beloved souls, in order to do so. Utilize these resources. Remember prayer opens up many doors. Intention is important, desire for the highest always, consistently reaching for your Heavenly Father to receive the blessing of His Love, the touch of His Light and with the knowledge that you know at this time, the blessings that have been given to you, the efforts you have made. All of these things will come together and create the conditions that are optimal for the development of this gift. It is essentially very simple my beloved souls, but indeed challenging for you on earth. The resources of heaven are yours. You need but ask and it will be given. You need but choose and you will find success. You need but love yourselves and all those around you and harmony will ensue and be yours.

Thank you for listening to me this night. I am forever your servant. It is my privilege to serve you my beloveds, and my blessing. God bless you. Seretta Kem always by your side and always will be. God bless you. God bless you beloveds. I love you.
