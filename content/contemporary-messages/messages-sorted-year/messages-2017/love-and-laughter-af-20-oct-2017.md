And God loves you even more, and we all love you, each one of you, for you are lovable. Sometimes you think you are not, but you are. Even when you think you are not lovable, you’re funny. You laugh at things that make you perturbed. They are so silly. I come when I can to help you to laugh and I will be with you as you pray for this gift, direct voice. I will come to lift your spirits, to encourage you, to bring my light to help you. I love you. I love you all. I love you because you make me laugh. I love you because you laugh at me. I love you because I love you. God bless you I am Goldie. I love you.
