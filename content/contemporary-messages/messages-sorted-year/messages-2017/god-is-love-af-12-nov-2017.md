First United Spiritualist Church, Burnaby, B. C. Canada

Received by Al Fike.

 

I am Matthew and I come as a messenger from God to tell you that you are all loved, that indeed God is Love, and that as you open yourselves to this gift much will be given in surprising ways, in beautiful events within your life that will bring inspiration, that will bring wisdom, that will bring deep understanding and will teach you how to bring Love from your soul to others. 

This Light and Love that will build within you will act to ignite a blessing for those whom you love and those who are within your circles. This gift awaits every soul, no matter their condition at this moment. God does not judge. God gives to each soul that longs for this blessing for each soul is destined to find Light through their existence, not only in this world but in the next. Many blessings are available to each and everyone who so desires these gifts. It takes a simple prayer, a longing of the soul, a desire for Light, to be uplifted and to know Truth from that place deep within you. It is yours for the asking, my friends. It is yours always. It is God's expression of Love for each and every one of you. 

Seek for this gift and all others gifts shall follow. Seek to know your true self and you will come to know your own soul. In this knowing you will truly know God as your soul opens and flourishes in this Light and Love. The perceptions that allow you, that bring you to the awareness of your Creator will also flourish and bring you Truth.

Beloved souls, be in the Light. Seek to love one another. Seek to love yourself. Seek to be a channel of Light in this world. The world needs this Light, this Love, this gift. May you be a channel of such for others. God bless you. I am Matthew. I give my love to you all. God bless you.
