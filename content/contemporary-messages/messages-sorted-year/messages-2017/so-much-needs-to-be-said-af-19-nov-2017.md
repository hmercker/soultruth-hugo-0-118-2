Â 

Bless you, my friends, I am Louis XIV of France. I wish to tell my story with your gift of Direct Voice to the world for I had to struggle from the hells to a place of Light. I am not in the Celestial Heavens but I do know of the Father's Love and I continue to pray to be redeemed by this gift from God.

I wish to tell my people and all peoples of this world of this gift, the power to redeem even one such as myself from those dark places. There are many others from my country who also wish to speak. Napoleon Bonaparte wishes to speak. Louis Pasteur wishes to speak. Marie Antoinette...many others. Your roster will be so crowded with many personages of history who have stories to tell the people of this earth. Of course, the angels of God, the beloved Master Jesus, so many others will come and bring their Light and Love as you gather the people around you and tell of this magnificent Truth and as you tell your own stories of bringing Light to your souls, Love to your hearts, the understanding of all things spiritual and of God. Indeed, there is much to say, much to say. The world needs to hear of these Truths. They need to wake, to awaken from their dream, from the error that they live, from the half-truths that they know, from their own pain, for many, so many are lost in this world and need the comfort of God and the Truth of His Love.

We will all speak with one voice: *"Seek ye the kingdom of heaven through the gift of God's Love."* This is what we wish to say, to share with humanity our stories of how God has redeemed us and is healing us from our past mistakes and dark deeds. I will come and speak, dressed as I would have been while I walked this earth. My personage would not be mistaken for I will certainly look as I should as the king of France of those times. Each will come forward in their full regalia. There will be no mistake, my friends, who we are, no doubt. In this we hope that those who we speak to will listen to our words and be inspired by what we have to say. Our prayers are with you, my friends. Our prayers are with you. We await the opening of this gift, the opening of a great door between your world and ours. So much needs to be said, so many gifts can be given, so much understanding offered by our message and our care for this world. For as God touches our souls so we have a great compassion and a desire to bring Truth to those who are lost.

I did not understand humanity when I walked this earth. I lived a life so pampered and removed from those who lived in my country. I had great anguish and pain when my eyes were opened realizing that I could indeed have done much to help my people, but I did nothing. I merely gratified my own desires and walked pompously through life thinking I deserved all that I received and those who had nothing deserved as much. This is such folly for I landed in a place of great deprivation when I passed into the world of spirit. I had to struggle tooth and nail out of the pits of hell. So my experience has led me to understand the folly of those who are blind and greedy and lack love. I understand these souls and I wish to direct my message to those who continue to live in this way, in this ignorance, in this depravity, to tell them what lies ahead as they continue to blindly move forward in such darkness. Many in your world need to hear my message and to know that for every thing one does in this world there are consequences, severe and exact. With the power of this gift I think many will listen and take heed to my words and the words of those who have had a similar experience in their life.

There are so many possibilities of this gift, my friends, so many doors opened so that the communication between us and yourselves may be clear and definitive and full of Truth. So I will stand by you, my friends. I gather many by my side who will pray for you in the hopes to bring Truth to humanity and the hopes that many will change their ways and seek to walk in Light, to follow that golden rule to bring more justice and harmony to this world, equality for all, enough for all to live a life that is meant by God.

God bless you, my friends. Thank you for listening for me. I will certainly come again to the medium to speak my words in my own tongue to my own people. Blessings to you, blessings to you. I am Louis XIV of France. God bless you.
