There is something stirring deep within you, a new awakening, an opening up of those parts of your soul that has long been asleep and you feel the power of this and you are excited by it. For these are exciting times for you beloved souls, when those faculties deep within you come alive and you come to know your true selves, your true potential, the great possibilities that come with an awakened soul.

Most in your world are asleep. Most in your world do not seek to understand what lays within them but you beloved souls, intrepid adventurers on life's path, have chosen to seek Truth, to awaken to the Truth, and all of this is predicated upon your desire and your willingness to know the power of Love. For Love is the energy, the source, which will ignite the awakening of your souls. It is God’s Love, His Essence from His great Soul that gives to you this flame that shall indeed bring many, many aspects that are deep within you alive and awake. 

This journey never ends beloved souls, this journey of awakening. For you can never receive enough of this great essence of Love, it is infinite. And you, within your soul, have the capacity to receive this infinite blessing given to you over and over again for all eternity. It shall be given as you progress through life’s path, through the spheres of spirit and onto the Celestial Kingdom. You shall receive this blessing as you continue to pursue it and ask for this gift from God.

It is very simple beloveds. It does not require a great deal of dissection or analysis. No, it is merely your willingness to be with God in all honesty and sincerity, to truly seek to be at-one with your Creator. In this seeking, and opening, and growing, expanding, evolving and awakening will come so many blessings, such great Truth that you cannot fathom at this time this great Source that you are tapping into with your prayers and longings, but your souls know and your soul will inform your mind of these great and wondrous truths and experiences that are coming.
 
So as you pray for this Love, know that you set yourself upon a great journey, a journey of awakening, a journey towards God, at-onement. Many, many blessings and openings and revelations will come to you because God has laid within your soul the capacity to understand these things, to experience His Love in all its fullness and wonderment, a gift to each soul in creation. A gift which must be asked for and received to be had. This prayer must come from the depths of your soul in all earnestness and longing and in accordance to this intensity and sincerity will come the inflow of this great gift. 

So my beloved and beautiful souls, you are given an opportunity whilst you pray together, to bring a great Light into your midst, to inspire your souls and uplift you, and assist you in understanding what it is that you truly seek for. Allow your souls to inform you, my beloveds. Allow yourselves to have your eyes opened, your faculties awakened, a new reality dawning with your consciousness that will change everything – everything. For this Love is the highest and most powerful gift given to humanity and it is meant that each soul may come awake through Love, to the great Love of God.

God bless you beloveds. I am Augustine and I love you. God bless you.
