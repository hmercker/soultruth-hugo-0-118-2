Â 

God bless you, I am Serreta Kem. We will continue to do certain procedures upon your bodies, your spirit body while you are praying in this off time. I would suggest that you take some of the messages that you received regarding Direct Voice and read them together, discuss these pieces of information so that you are all clear - on the same page as you say - regarding these bits of information that have been disseminated over these months for there are many pages involved. We have spent a great deal of effort and direction and guidance for each one of you. If you are unsure, please refer to these writings. It does not hurt to reread these messages a few times at least. You will find different pieces of information with each reading.

This is a time of nurturing for you, my beloveds. Allow yourselves times of rest, times of contemplation and prayer, times to communicate with one another, to share your insights. Yet we do not wish that you to engage yourselves intensely in these things, merely in harmony and with a harmonious rhythm. There are no edicts for you to follow, my beloveds, merely suggestions that will help you to clear your mind and engage your soul. Be kind to yourself. Continue in your dietary habits. Be open to each day as a gift from God.

May the wisdom that is coming and has been imparted to you seep down into your souls and in that will come a transformation of this knowledge to something deeper and more profound. May your souls continue to flourish in the Father's Love. May your bodies continue to strengthen, become lighter and harmonious physically. May your minds find your souls, to truly know your souls and to make this marriage of soul and mind that it may become harmonious and one, one such that all the faculties that you possess may work together in harmony and make complete an understanding and awareness.

Yes your perceptions of the world are changing and will continue to change and be altered by the blessings of the Father's Love and by the conditions in which you find yourselves within for the development of Direct Voice. As such gifts are opening, knowledge is blossoming, Truth is flourishing within you and Love continues to influence all. May you have a keen desire to absorb all this change and growing and awareness within. In short order you will be a new person, a deeply changed person with deep insights, true wisdom, greater faith and more Love within you. All this comes with each day as each day marches forward into the next so that you continue to grow incrementally and evolve into that beautiful being that God has created - full of potentials and gifts and beauty. And so this is awakened within you by the Father's Love and so you will express this in wondrous ways, beloved souls. Carry the Light. Burn the light bright. Do not let it diminish but to strengthen. Every moment is an opportunity to bring your light forward, to be ever closer to God, to come to know your true self - that beautiful soul that is you, God's wondrous creation.

God bless you, beautiful souls. May your day be filled with Light for the angels are with you. God's Light shines upon you. May this manifest within this day in beautiful ways. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem.
