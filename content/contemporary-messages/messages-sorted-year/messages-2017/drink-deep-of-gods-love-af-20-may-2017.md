My dear brothers and sisters, come and drink of the living waters of God’s Love.  Their hearts are parched in these desert places of life, and they have come to be refreshed. Father, bless them, bless them in their desire and eagerness to be embraced by You. For they know Love and they wish to know Love more abundantly. May you refresh them, Father, in the flow of your Love, these wondrous waters that heal and bind the wounds that give hope and faith, that bring knowledge and strength, that guide and heal and bring the Peace that passes all understanding. 

Beloved souls, you sit in the midst of God’s Presence. Drink deep these waters. Seek with the yearnings of your souls, open your eyes to this Truth and reality that you are loved, loved beyond measure, loved like a mighty ocean, loved everlasting. 

The time comes in your world where many will seek fellowship together, for they have become weary of the many distractions of this world, and their souls seek for something of greater substance and greater meaning. My beloveds, I urge you to come together in love, seek the fellowship that comes with prayer and longing together, the opening of your souls and your hearts, that you may find a strength and a connection and the grace that comes with prayer. For you will need these things in the times to come, as the conditions of this world shift and change, as the old ways begin to crumble. It is the power of Love and the human heart that will bring a new world, a new way of being that will not only benefit yourselves but for those generations to come. For the world is parched, it is desolate and needs Love and you, my beloveds, have come together and you feel a yearning within you, a desire for the awakening of your souls. My beloveds, your souls become awakened with Love. Your souls find the joy that it seeks, the knowing, the peace, with Love. And the highest Love in all in the universe is the Love of God. Seek these living waters, God’s Essence, His Love, and a whole new world will open to you, my beloveds, a world that is full of wonder, a world that never ends, where Love Divine flows like a mighty river and it will carry you into greater Light. 

God enfolds you at this time and will enfold each soul that seeks the Grace, the Love, the Touch from God. Seek it with each day, take your time, and pray. Even if you are unknowledgeable of prayer, set some time aside in your life each day and talk to God for you will receive an answer, a sign, an acknowledgement. And if you ask God to place His Love within your soul, He shall surely do so. And it will build, this Blessing, this Life will build within your soul. In time you will become at one with God as His Essence transforms you and makes you whole, fully healed, and filled with joy and true knowledge. This invitation is to every soul in the world. It is a simple, simple question; *“Will you come and be with Me, with your heavenly Father, will you spend a few moments with me for I have much to give to you, bountiful blessings, Divine? Be with Me and you will know Me, be with Me and you will know your true selves. Be at Peace, for I bring Peace. Feel my Love, and you will feel the true acknowledgement and the glory that is you in your life.”* 

God’s invitation is for all. A simple prayer, a simple desire, a willingness to be open, to be blessed, is all that is required, for God’s Love is for every soul upon this world, no matter what religion or culture or colour of skin. No, these things matter not. It is the yearning of the soul, the yearning of the soul, where every child upon this planet has a soul and within that soul is a seed that yearns to come awake and alive. And God will touch that soul and awaken that soul and bring new life to that soul if it but open and receive this gift of Love. 

Blessed and beloveds, I come. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you.
