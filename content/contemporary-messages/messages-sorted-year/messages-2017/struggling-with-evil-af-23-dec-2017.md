It is good that you come together on occasions to reinforce your connection, your efforts together, drawing in those who are not here in the flesh, recreating this circle so that we may continue in this effort to bring the gifts forward that God has granted to you, beloved souls. Yes some of you are struggling with the conditions of this world and you  are well protected from these conditions now and while you were together. You continue to have your angel friends at your side. Keep this in mind, beloveds, when you venture out into the world that you do indeed have angels by your side. 

Now is the time where you will be testing these new ways and new perspectives in the world and the world will test you, my beloveds. It will try to bring you from that condition of love into the common condition of this world which is not of love, it is of the mind. So you must reinforce the condition of your soul and the awareness of your soul. Bring it forth into the world, express it in the world. Be strong in this condition of love of the soul and the awareness of the soul. This is your challenge and your test, beloved souls, to maintain this perspective above all else, to allow God’s Love to continue to flow into your souls and flow through you to others. To consciously decide to be in this condition of love rather than to allow the condition of your minds to dominate your actions and thoughts.

God continues to pour His blessings upon you. The world continues to challenge you, my beloveds. Yet you have one another, you have the angels at your side and you have God’s Blessings upon you. This has not changed. It continues to be, to uplift you and to bring you into light. May you find times in your day when you can pray and luxuriate in this light, to continue to reinforce this light within you, to continue to grow in this light. It requires your efforts, as always. It requires your desire and your faith. Nothing has changed in this world but everything has changed within your inner world. So you must bring this change forward and apply it in your lives. As you continue to grow in this great effort of change within, so these gifts will come forward and manifest in your lives. 

The power of free will my beloveds is so powerful. You scarcely recognize its power but you utilise this gift each and every moment in your thoughts and actions, in your prayers and desires. The conditions of this world are governed by free will and that free will has brought about such intense energies of the mind within this world that all is out of balance because humanity is so unaware of its own power to choose and unaware of what those choices are. Most just respond to the conditions around them, to the thoughts that bombard each soul each day and their own desires which are a mixture of light and dark, good and evil. Evil is not necessarily of the type you may expect, but evil is defined as those conditions that are not in harmony with God’s Creation. 

So when we say to you: *“you carry evil”* we merely define this as you continue to struggle towards harmony with God’s laws. So you too struggle with evil as do all humanity. Yet you have the power of God’s Love within you, that wondrous gift that eradicates evil, darkness, disharmony and brings peace and light, love and harmony. Thus your souls so desire this, this condition of harmony within you and all about you. You have a craving for this and when you confront a condition that is not in harmony, then often you feel alone, that God is not with you though this is not true, my beloveds. God is always with you. Light is always with you. But you must safeguard this light and you must nourish this light. Continue to be in harmony with God and with your souls so that you may feel that joyous awakening, that strength within you. Yes it is not easy in this world. You continue to struggle but you are very much stronger than you were and these struggles are less, less frequent and less intense. You will continue to grow in this light until these struggles are a thing of the past and your life is truly an expression of joy and harmony and truth and love.

You continue to edge closer to that condition. You continue to grow in God’s Love and you will find your way. God strengthens you with every prayer, pours His Love upon you, sends His angels to administer to you and He shall continue to do so all the days of your lives in this world and all your time in spirit until you reach the Celestial Heavens. There God’s Love will be your nourishment always, His Living Waters pouring into you with such measure and power and glory that your joy will be unimaginable. 

May you continue to walk this path in steady commitment in faith, with positive thoughts, eager souls, beautiful, beautiful efforts in love. We will continue to accompany you on this journey. You are never alone, my beloveds and you are dearly loved, children of God. Be His channels of love. Walk that road of light and know that the journey just begins but will be for all eternity. God bless you, beloveds. I am Seretta Kem and I love you dearly. God bless you.
