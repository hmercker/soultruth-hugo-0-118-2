# I wish to Bring my Music to Humanity

November 21<sup>st</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C.

Received by A.F.

Â 

I am Frederic Chopin. I too wish to bring music to humanity. I have many more compositions I could express to mankind since I have pursued my gift ever further as I explore the worlds of spirit and explored my own soul's potential to bring forth the beauty of music and sound to humanity, to the world and to my world.

I wish to have this opportunity to reveal the gift of inspirational music to all your brothers and sisters in this world. Good luck with your efforts, beloved souls. Many of us wait in the wings to come forth in this way through this gift. There will be such a variety of beautiful spirits who will express wondrous revelations to mankind. When these floodgates open, so much can be given, so much will be given in surprising, beautiful, glorious and creative gifts and blessings to the world.

May God continue to bless you, beloved friends, and bless all of us in this great effort to uplift humanity and awaken the souls of many. God bless you.
