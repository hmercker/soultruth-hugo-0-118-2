There are many in spirit who are with you this night. You are connected to the many souls that you prayed for, for these blessings. There is no distance truly between souls. That connection and that closeness is always with you when there is a bond of Love. 

Those who are in spirit whom you love are connected to you, beloved souls. As you pray, pray for them. As you pray, pray for the world, all your brothers and sisters in this beautiful world. For when you pray in this way you bring great Light, Light that touches many souls, Light that will ignite a longing within those souls. For the world will change as each soul brings Love, as each soul understands the power of Love and expresses this in their daily lives. True change will come in this way as God uses each earnest and sincere soul to be a channel of His Love in this world. 

Seek this blessing, beloved souls. Seek to truly know your Heavenly Father, to be in this deep rapport and connection with God for in this all that you aspire to do in this world for others will come about in wondrous ways. The expression of your soul in faith and longing, Truth in Love will come with your prayers and understanding of this simple way.

Be in this Light, beloved souls, the Light of God's true Love for you. It is with you now. Open yourselves to this blessing, Truly these gifts are showered upon you. I am Keea Atta Kem. I love you, beloved souls, beautiful, beautiful Lights. I am with you. God bless you.
