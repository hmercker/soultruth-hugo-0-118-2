Gibsons, B.C. Canada. 

…I love you. (Jeanne: I love you too) You want to know where I lived? (Jeanne: Yeah, I want to know everything about you.) I can’t tell you everything, some things are a secret. (Jeanne: Yes, you can…oh, yes you can.)
Yes, I died as a little girl in a place that you call Belgium. It was many years ago, and I grew up in spirit. I was taught many things as I developed in the spirit world and came into the Celestial Kingdom. Now I serve the dear Master Jesus and our Heavenly Father in Love. I have known such joy, and I am joy. It is my gift to bring joy. 

You need not concern yourself with all the details of my life. It is not important. What is important is we are friends. We love you and you love us. We are all part of this beautiful Light, the golden Light of God’s Love. We will never leave you. I am your friend and I love you dearly, all of you. I am close to you. I will continue to help you, to help to uplift you and bring you to that beautiful place where God shines His Light upon you.

It is so simple. You need not concern yourselves with all the details of those who help you. They will give you the information you need, but they will not burden you with too much detail, it is not necessary. Just know that you are loved and we are close. We will continue to give our guidance, our messages of Love, and bring our love to you. For you are very special to our hearts. We are close to you, all of you. It shall ever be so as we all participate in this beautiful dance of life, the joy of Love, the beauty of God, the wonderment of your souls. We are all a part of this, brothers and sisters all, in this wondrous world. 

God bless you. Goldie loves you. Goldie loves you. God bless you.
