I am Albert Schweitzer and I too, support your efforts and I too, wish to speak through Direct Voice.  I will speak in my own language to my people. I hope to bring greater reason and truth to my fellow countrymen, to teach them that love is truly the power and the solutions to many problems that one encounters in life. I am with you my friends. 

May God bless you. I am with you and I walk with you upon this journey to bring truth to mankind. I inhabit the Celestial Kingdom, another angel in Heaven, for I have prayed diligently for the Father’s Love and He has blessed me mightily. I am with you, my friends, with my love and my prayers. I am at your service in this effort to bring truth and love to mankind. God bless you.


**Note** Albert Schweitzer OM (14 January 1875 – 4 September 1965) was an Alsatian polymath. He was a theologian, organist, writer, humanitarian, philosopher, and physician. A Lutheran, Schweitzer challenged both the secular view of Jesus as depicted by the historical-critical method current at this time, as well as the traditional Christian view. His contributions to the interpretation of Pauline Christianity concern the role of Paul's mysticism of "being in Christ" as primary and the doctrine of Justification by Faith as secondary.
