# Stand in the Flow

November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

This little girl will not put her finger in the dike. Instead I will help you make more cracks and fissures so that the waters may flow. I will help you. I will help you. I will dance upon that barrier and sing it away, sing it away. For it is meant to go. These waters that are building are meant for you and they will come. They are coming. There are many deep fissures that allow it to flow already and it will only be greater and more beautiful and more potent. 

Stand in the flow, beloveds. I will hold your hand because I love you so. God bless you. I am Goldie. I love you so, my special friends on earth. I love you so.
