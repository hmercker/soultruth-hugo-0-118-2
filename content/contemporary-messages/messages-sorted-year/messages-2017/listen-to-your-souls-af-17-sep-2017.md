I am so happy [to hear my sweet wife speak the Truths and to speak to you.](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2017/those-who-serve-in-love-will-succeed-af-17-sep-2017/) She is right, when I walked the earth and performed my mission which God gave to me, and Jesus spoke his words of Truth, I was reluctant to share these Truths in an overt way. I relied upon my friends to bring this Truth into the world in whatever way they were able to do.

Remember, my friends, life is fleeting and it is short. Yet God brings to you many opportunities, many opportunities to bring Light. Within your souls is a deep desire to serve in this way. Always listen to your souls. Seek the truth, continue to pray and pray again for the gift of the Father’s Love. For in this, all is possible. All will be given. You will not be confused or reluctant or hampered in any way, for you will have the great Light of God’s Hand upon you, and you will serve in many facets and aspects your fellow man. 

We in the Celestial Kingdom will continue to support and guide you and show you the way. As you listen and obey the guidance that is given, so much will open up in surprising ways, unexpected, beautiful opportunities to serve God in Love. To each their gifts and then comes their service for God, all informed by Love. Each of you is unique and has much to give in your own way. Allow this to unfold in your life. Take everything to prayer. Allow God to inform everything in your life, and all will come in harmony. All will unfold as it should within God’s Plan.

Continue in your efforts. We are with you my friends. We continue to support and be with you. We see many changes coming for each one of you. Many possibilities lay before you like a great banquet. Are you ready to accept what God wishes for you? These great blessings of service, these great opportunities to travel the world, to be a clear channel for His Love, His wisdom, His Truth.

These are exciting times as you continue to build within yourselves a great Light and recognize your gifts and accept that which God has to give. God bless you. I am James Padgett. I too love you and I am with you often. We see your progress, we see the Light in your souls. This is exciting and joyful, truly beautiful. Please continue in all that you do. God bless you. God bless you.
