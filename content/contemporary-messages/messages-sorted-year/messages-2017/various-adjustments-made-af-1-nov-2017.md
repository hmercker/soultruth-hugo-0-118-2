We continue to make various adjustments within your bodies bringing different chemicals into your physical bodies and spirit body preparing for the direct voice. Some of you have felt physical changes within you. This is our doing, our efforts to bring a harmony within your bodies that may be utilised to create the conditions necessary for direct voice. You have also felt the uplifting conditions which are placed in this beautiful sanctuary and this shall continue to be. We will continue to uphold you and to support you. We are working every minute of every hour of every day on your behalf. When you are in your sleep state we continue to work. In fact, there is one more session within the dark room in your sleep state and this is helping to facilitate the advancement of the direct voice conditions.

We are very pleased to see you are joyful and loving towards one another. This is the optimal condition, beloved souls, to be in this state of joy, to be uplifted by the Heavenly Father at all times, to not allow the material conditions or any worries or concerns interfere with this state of joyfulness and peace and gratitude. You must continue to pray constantly for the inflowing of God’s Love, His Touch upon you, His Light to touch you, to build and build amongst you and within you so that we may come to that place where the manifestation of material mediumship may be possible and that in this, the highest may manifest. You are doing well, my beloveds. You are doing well. You continue to forge ahead. You continue to look at yourselves and to be diligent in your prayers and your support and love of one another. How beautiful this is to observe. How you have made leaps and bounds in your own spiritual condition and soulful awakening. You continue to open your eyes and to look with love.

Beloved souls, I would remind you of your commitment towards dietary needs. I would encourage you not to indulge in those foods that you know are not helpful to your body and to not over indulge in your eating. Beloved souls, I do not wish for you to be uninterested in your food. No. This is a gift from God, these delicious foods, but everything in moderation my beloveds, everything in moderation so that your systems are not clogged up with heavy foods difficult to digest. For those who are sensitive to sugars and fats I would say that you must be conscious of what you consume and make every effort to be in good physical condition. This is needed, beloved souls. This is needed as it is a requirement for you to be successful in this venture. 

But as I have said, you are making great progress in many ways. You continue to strip away those old conditions which do you no good and to look forward in eager anticipation of the new, of the reborn soul that is coming within you. This is the effect of God’s Love, is it not? To remake you so that you may have those attributes that reflect God and His Great Soul.

God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you in these efforts. May this joy continue to build within you, this deep sense of closeness to God and the awareness of this peace that passes all understanding. Do not allow your minds to interfere with what your soul already knows and is expressing in the world. Quiet yourself when you see that you are expressing yourself in a way that is not in harmony with love, quiet yourself, beloveds. Be simple in your interactions, loving and graceful, tolerant and continue to acknowledge one another in loving ways. This is so important that you express what you see, the beauty within one another, for you have a power in this, the power to heal and to comfort, to uplift and to encourage each of you to see yourselves in this light, this beautiful loving light. 

May His Touch continue to wrought the changes within, to carry you Heavenward, to find the true joy that comes with knowing God. God bless you, beloveds. I am Seretta Kem. I love you.
