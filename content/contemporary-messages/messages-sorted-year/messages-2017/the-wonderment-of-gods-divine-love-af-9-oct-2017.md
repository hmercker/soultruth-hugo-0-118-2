God bless you, beloveds, I am Faith. I have come to join you in your prayers, your supplications to the Heavenly Father and to add my prayers and my love.

The living waters of God's Love pour upon you at this moment. Your souls are thirsty. Drink deep, my beloveds, for the benefits and blessings of this Love will stay with you not just in this life but for your entire existence. The power of this Love will be with you forever. This is what God gives in Love, what God in His generosity, in His loving spirit towards you and all His children in this world to help you to open to Him, to know Him and to be touched by His Essence, the Divine Love. God wants all His children, all the souls in this world, to receive this gift, to walk in the harmony of His Love and to be close to His great Soul. Do you want this, beloved children? Do you crave this and desire this, this deep touch from God that makes all your worries and cares fall away and brings wisdom and joy in its stead?

Every soul is precious to God. Every prayer from the heart will be heard and responded to. When you long for this Love and seek its blessing within your soul, the angels are drawn to you. Every time you reach out with that single desire to know the power of God's Love, you draw Light and many blessings to you and God sends his beloved angels to be close, to bring their love and their gifts to bring healing and comfort to you. As you pray together as a group you seek to be a channel of Love and Light for the world, then this Light and these blessings flow forth and touch many, many of those souls who are connected to you in Love. Many who are in deep need both here in this world and in the spirit world are touched by this Light. You draw to this world a beautiful Light through your prayers. You open a great portal of Light from Heaven spreading out into this world and touching many souls, many you are not aware of and many who crowd around this little circle of Light from spirit. They are drawn because they seek a way to greater Light. They seek healing and a release from their pain, for many spirits are in pain and darkness in the semi-light, the greyness of those spheres in spirit that are close to the earth plane. So you are used as a conduit to give healing and comfort to many as your soul grows in Light and your capacity to love is heightened by the blessings of God's Love. So as you gather together in prayerful communion, the Light intensifies and builds because your inner Light, the condition of your soul grows and expands in Light as it responds to the Heavenly Father's Touch of Love. 

May you drink these living waters and feel its cool and refreshing touch within your souls dispelling all those conditions that cause you trouble, bringing peace, deep and wondrous peace. For in these moments you are with God perk up your eyes, feel the sensations of your soul, know that God touches you in this moment. Something wondrous is happening within you as you open yourselves to this mighty rush of the living waters of God's Soul entering into you, quenching your thirst, lifting you ever closer to God and bringing greater harmony to your being and a beautiful Light, a beautiful Light as it grows within and shines forth in this world. You are needed, beloved souls, you are needed to bring your Lights into this world so that God may empower you with Love, that your souls may shine forth and touch many others. So many thirst in this world, beloved souls. So many seek and yet so few find this simple blessing and understand its power and beauty.

May your awareness continue to grow that you may see more fully the wonderment of God's Blessings of Love, that you may teach others of this gift that they too may pray and be open and understand what is possible, what God wishes to give each soul, for His Love for each soul is limitless no matter the conditions that they carry, they are loved, they are loved as you are loved. God bless you, beloved souls. May you be carried into blissful Light and be with God and have a glimpse as to how much He loves you. You are precious in His sight, His child in Light. 

May you continue to seek and grow in your relationship with God and come to truly know yourselves, that part of you that remains forever as you journey through the many phases of life and in time come to that place where all is in harmony and beauty. The Celestial Kingdom calls every soul to come and join in this wondrous beautiful life where joy is unlimited and Love pours within forever. This is what your souls long for, beloveds. This is what your souls prompt you to seek, a place in those heavenly realms where Love is the currency of all things and is expressed in all things. May you find your way and take that journey where God's great promise is that you will find at-onement within. That gift is realized through Love, the inflowing of His Love into your souls. It will come as you continue to ask and pray and seek and allow this gift to enter you in great abundance, the transformation of your soul in Love.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Faith and I love you too. I am with you. I continue to be with you as you journey and find yourselves, come to know your own spiritual power and beauty and purpose. May His Love continue to find lodgment within you and you continue to recognize and feel the joy of this transformational gift that will bring to you everything that you desire that is in harmony with God's Will and His Laws of Love. So it will be. So it will be. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
