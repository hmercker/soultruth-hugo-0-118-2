God bless you, I am Augustine, your teacher. I would invite you to come together each day in prayer. In so doing we will bring forth some teachings, which you may compile within a collection as you have been doing in the past for there is still much to impart, many subjects to address. Between you, this creates a powerful condition that will allow us to speak clearly and to give what we desire to do. So I ask you to consider this and to make these appointments that we may continue to speak and teach for the benefit of mankind. In doing this you do a great service, my beloveds, and we will play our role, fulfill our function, as you commit and be a part of this beautiful expression of Love and Truth.

God bless you, beloveds. Your teacher Augustine will come again and speak of things that are true and inspiring to help your souls grow and your minds to understand the beautiful complexities of life and the wonderment that is your true self, your soulful being, that will grow and find its expression for all eternity. May we continue in our efforts to help to teach humanity of these Truths and inspire others to seek the Father’s Love.

God bless you, my beloveds. I am Augustine and I love you. God bless you.
