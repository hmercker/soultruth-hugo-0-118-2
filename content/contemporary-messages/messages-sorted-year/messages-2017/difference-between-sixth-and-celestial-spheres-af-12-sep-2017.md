# The Differences between the Sixth Sphere and the Celestial Spheres 

September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2017

Received by Al Fike.

Gibsons, B.C. Canada. 

I have returned. I am Leytergus. You have asked for my presence and I have come. You wish to know some of my history. Yes, I lived in what you call the Middle East. I was an Arab. I helped to found the university of that area and the beginnings of such studies in the world. Indeed, this university was very different from what you recognize as a university in this day but still the principles are there, the desire to seek truth, to discuss and debate our perceptions of the truth and the reality of this world.

I was a philosopher and a student at that time. I did not know of the Divine Love because the beloved Master did not bring this teachings forward until many, many years later and God opened the doors to His Love. I was in the sixth sphere at the time and because of my innate curiosity I became interested in the teachings of Jesus, his efforts in the world and in spirit. I came to know this teaching as true and I began to pray for the Father’s Love and received it in great abundance, as it is not so difficult to receive when one is in those higher spheres. 

For many though, who reside in the sixth sphere, find it difficult to accept that it is not the mind that is the dominant player in one’s life. In these conditions in spirit, indeed the mind can become very sophisticated and developed. Many spirits are satisfied with this condition, so many do not pursue the development of the soul and the mind of the soul. This is a concept unheard of to them. They take great pleasure in their intellectual pursuits, in the perfection of their spiritual condition and in the beauty in which they reside in the sixth sphere. 

So it is easier for a young soul such as yours, beginning their existence, knowing who they are and developing their identity to seek the Father’s Love. For in the innocence of your soul you are open to this gift and this pursuit of Truth. But for a soul that has experienced many things, that has developed a very keen mind and has formulated their perception of reality to such a fine degree, it is difficult to change. Even though there are limitations on those in the sixth sphere, there will never cease a pursuit of understanding of the universe for the universe is vast and complex. So this pursuit will indeed sustain these spirits for a very, very long time. So the need to bring the soul into alignment with God in this way, in the Divine Love, is not seen as necessary to those who walk the natural path, whose love is refined, perceptions keen and mind highly developed.

I know you asked this question: ”Why do so few seek the Divine Love? Why is this such a difficult challenge to many?” As I have told you, it is because the mind has dominance and what the mind desires and pursues carries the energy and commitment of that soul to its ends. So you in your way, your desires see Love as more important. In this pursuit of Love, in this great Truth that opens up to you as your souls are awakened and the mind of your soul comes forth into your consciousness, you receive Truth differently and you revel in these revelations and you find joy. You recognize the gifts of Truth which comes with God’s Love. It is a different way; it is a higher way as you well know. It is a way that not every soul will pursue for each soul has a choice and each soul will follow the path of their own desire for God gives them the gift of free will.

I urge you, beloved souls, to not judge those who seek Truth in different ways for the journey of Truth and the journey of developing the spirit has many, many different paths, many routes to take to God. I do not wish for you to think of those in the sixth sphere as not knowing God, for they do. But that knowing is not the knowing that one receives when the soul is enlivened by Divine Love. 

This is a pity, I know, for such great joy, ecstatic blissful awareness comes with this Love. Yet, those who follow the natural love and are purified within themselves and their love is beautiful and bright, know a joy as well and will continue to live in this light that is of the natural love and the natural understanding of God. 

Yet I have experienced both, both conditions, both realities. I must say I have no regrets that I have indeed followed the path of Divine Love and sought to be at one with God in this way. What I have gleaned in experience and Truth and knowledge is far greater than anything I experienced in the sixth sphere. I have joy so much greater than my fellow spirits who live in the natural love. I have understanding much deeper. Yes, I have great compassion for all spirits and all peoples for this comes with God’s Love. We do not feel superior to others. This is not how we think. We have a knowledge and understanding that allows us to feel a great love for others, a true understanding of the soul and of God. This is the blessing that comes with God’s Love.

God bless you, beloved souls. I will come again and speak. God bless you. God bless you.
