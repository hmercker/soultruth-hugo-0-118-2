Beautiful souls, it is your teacher Augustine here. How important it is for you to pray and connect with those groups from around the world who are themselves praying for the Father’s Love, praying together in circles of light.  For in this effort that is coordinated amongst you there comes a mutual benefit and a benefit to we who serve in God’s desire to bless all of you.

 It is important to build these bonds of love, to forge this network of light amongst you and we have told you so as you have come together in various combinations of gatherings, different groups in different places.  We have told you how important it is to be together in prayer and to connect with one another, to embrace one another, to love one another.  Because, as you do so, you create through this love, this connection, this soul recognition a strand of light connecting you and that other individual. As you sit together in circles, gatherings of prayer, you reinforce that light and that bond and as you pray for the other, wherever they be in the world, you reinforce that bond of light, you make it stronger.  As God energizes these strands and lattice work of light, this is how the world will be changed my beloveds.  Through strengthening and expanding these strands of light, which will become a lattice that will encompass the world and the influence of this light and the power of this blessing, this effort will change the conditions of this world.  It will dissipate much of the darkness and will open doors of opportunity to serve and to be God’s channel in the world.  It is all part of God’s plan my beloveds as you reach out and connect, as you are part of this beautiful flow of light that reverberates around your globe and brings a resonance of love to others.  
The dear daughter that you pray for in your little group is hungry and eager for what God has to give.  Though those who are a part of her circle often do not see things as she sees them, they do not have the same vocabulary and understanding; they are open souls nonetheless.  They come together because they feel the blessings of God’s Love together.  This is what is important.  All else becomes irrelevant when there is a soul bond amongst this group.  

Minds can change, understandings evolve, true awareness emerges with a touch of God’s Love.  So I would encourage you to encourage them to continue to pray and be a part of this wondrous network that is growing and expanding in the world.  Each of you here has a role to play, as do others in helping to knit this network together.  Bringing all the fabrics into this wondrous tapestry God has entrusted you with this job, this role.  You are continuing to fulfill this role in loving ways, beloved souls.  Continue in your prayers and in your desires to be with others, to pray with others, to travel in order to forge those connections, to expand out to those souls who are waiting to be a part of this beautiful wondrous light.

Beloveds, do not despair because you do not recognize what it is that you are doing.  The role you are playing for your Heavenly Father.  For each of you is a valuable channel in this world and you are doing God’s Will and there are times when you are confused and do not see clearly what is to come.  This is only because the clouds of the human condition and your own mental machinations obscure your vision. Instead of relying upon the steadiness and strength of your soul, which is anchored with God, you are putting more credence into your own thinking and imagination.  This is human I know; you go back and forth and back and forth from that sense of security within your soul to the confusion and eagerness to know which comes with your mind.  In time this will not be so, the pendulum will swing less and less until you are indeed firmly with your soul perceptions, understanding and knowing. 

Indeed those times of confusion and concern will become less within you. There will come a time when you will be unassailable, unshakable from the deep and abiding faith and strength that comes with that soul knowing, the knowing of an awakened soul - the strength that comes from a soul awakened by God’s Love.  This will come my beloveds. It is coming and shall continue to grow within you, a new consciousness - the rebirth of your being in Love.  You are all feeling this, struggling as you continue to emerge from this birthing process, the new you, the true you, the beautiful soul that is you coming to envelop and infuse every part of you so that you are indeed a redeemed child of the Father, truly a child of the Father. You will act in the flow if His Will and His Love and you will see with the eyes of the soul. You will understand from a lofty place of vision and knowing.  This is all coming and ,though you are in transition, you begin to see a little bit here and there this new vision, this awakened deeper understanding; it will continue to grow and become clear. 

You must pray for the Father’s Love with every breath, for it is in this blessing that all will unfold in harmony and you will find your footsteps, your steadiness, your strength and you will be a fountain of love in the world.  For in this place, so different from so many, you will be a channel of love that many, many will be drawn to.  Is it not what everyone seeks, my beloveds, to be firmly grounded in the Love - to express love in a pure way?  To be God’s channel of love, to touch another and to bring a healing and a comfort - a sense that they are seen and recognized?  You will bring this my beloveds, you will bring this as you grow - as you accept this new emerging self born of Love and expressed in Love. 

God bless you my beloveds.  Your teacher Augustine continues to stand by your side as you emerge and become that expression of light and love in the world.  I love you dearly and you have many attendees - angels of light - who are with you in this birthing process and we love you dearly. God touches you deeply.  God bless you, Augustine loves you.  God bless you.
