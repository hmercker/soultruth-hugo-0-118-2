# Percy’s Greeting From God’s Kingdom of Love

First United Spiritualist Church, B.C. Canada

“Ho ho ho.” What a wonderful blessing to be able to speak to you through this instrument. As I have told him many times, he is a wonderful medium.  I have the blessing to be able to speak so soon after my passing. My passing was not so difficult, my friends. It was like easing into an old pair of slippers, so familiar and so comfortable. So I do indeed begin a new life. 

But I want to tell you about my old life, how I served God but not because I made big plans in service. When I found out about God's Love I was excited, I was blessed to know of this Love and to feel the great blessing of this Love within me as I continued to pray for it. I always wanted to serve people, to bring some Light and some laughter to the world. So I asked God to use me to bring blessings to others and I left it up to Him. He responded to my prayers and He gave me opportunities to serve, to bring Light, to talk of His Love. I was used to bless the children. I was used to bless those who are weary of life and confused. I was used every day to bring some Light to someone because I prayed to God to use me as a channel of His Love in the world in whatever way that He wished for me to serve. So those opportunities blossomed and God used me in many different ways, some surprising and not in ways I anticipated but ways that were in the flow of His Will, His Love. This is what I want to encourage all of you, my friends, to do. Ask God each day to be used as an instrument of His Peace, His Love and His blessings for someone. And God will put on your path the opportunity to serve in this way. This was very fulfilling, my friends. My prayers were answered and so will yours be answered if they are sincere, if you ask, if you seek to love, if you seek to be close to God, they will be answered.

I was told many years ago that if I served God, I would be given the keys to the kingdom. I did receive the keys. That door opened. I am now in a beautiful place of Light. God blessed me mightily because I chose to serve in Love. No, I was never perfect. I was never overly blessed with gifts but what I had, I used. What I could give, I gave. What I could do, I did. That's all it takes, my friends, an effort, a desire and faith, faith that God will indeed use every soul that desires to be a channel of Love in the world, to bring Light to this world. 

Be true to the desires of your souls, my friends, be true to God, be true to yourself and be who you are, that unique individual that God created. And when that part of you, that wondrous, beautiful part of you that is your soul opens and flourishes in Light and Love, it will be wondrous and wonderful what you will be able to do in the world. There will be nothing to stop you and everything to encourage you for the angels come by your side to help, to bring greater Light, to help you to understand the Truth and the wonderful laws of God's Creation. There is so much that is given to an earnest soul, a soul who honestly seeks to know God, to know the Truth, to be able to love in the world. I found my path because God touched me and showed me the way. May you find your own way to God and in that will be a wonderful adventure, an awakening with many gifts. Your spirit will soar with great joy. 

I wish to give my love to my daughters who have given so much to me. What beautiful souls they are and how proud I am of them and all of my family and my friends. I have had a wonderful life. And now I am having an even more wonderful life as I enter into the world of spirit and truly find that Kingdom that I've always wanted to know and to be within. The Kingdom of God is Love. I feel so blessed that I have come to that place of Light. God promised me this and God has fulfilled His promise. I feel such deep joy and gratitude for God's loving Touch upon me and upon all my friends who are here and many in this world who are seeking to do good, to find Truth, to express Love. You will be amply rewarded, my friends, you will. You will be astounded at what treasure you reap from expressing the treasures of your soul. So much awaits each one of you.

God bless you. God bless you, my friends. I am Percy. Yes, it is me. I love you all. Thank you. Thank you for seeking to be in the Light. The world needs so much more of beautiful people like yourselves. Continue to pray for His Love, beloveds. Pray for His Love. All will be well. I’ll continue to be with you as you grow in the Love and seek to serve God in this world. I know I will be with you to help you, to pray for you, to bring Love to you and Light. Dorothy and Darlene know that, I will never leave you. My love is always with you and I'll be close. And with all the rest in the family, I'll be close. 

God bless you. I love you. I love you all. You are all wonderful. You are all wonderful. God bless you in His Love. God bless you.
