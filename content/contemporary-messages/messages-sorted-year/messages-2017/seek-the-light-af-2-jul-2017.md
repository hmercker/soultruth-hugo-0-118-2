First United Spiritualist Church, Burnaby, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike.

 

May every soul be touched by God in this house of Light. May His Grace be your blessing, beloveds, and may your soul open to this wondrous gift of Love. I am Confucius and I come to bring my light and my message to you, beloved souls. 

Your lives are precious. You are precious and loved beyond your understanding. You are loved and you have been given the gift of life, a soul. You are experiencing your life in the flow of God’s Grace and Being. Open your eyes. Open your eyes, beloveds, and see the wonderment that is life, the wonderment which is your presence in this life and the wonderment of the presence of your soul within your bodies and realize that with these gifts can come many blessings and understandings and love. 

It is your choice beloveds. It is your choice to be in the Light, to explore the potentials of your soul, to understand that you are worthy of all great gifts and blessings from God. It is your choice to receive, to desire this and to be open to it, beloved souls.

May the Glory of God’s great Touch lift you into His Arms that you may know from every part of your being the Love of God and how that Love is personal, intimate, perfect and beautiful.

I am Confucius and I am happy to come to this group of earnest souls who seek Truth. May your desires and your prayers be answered, beloveds. May angels walk with you in your life. May you know Light and joy - the joy of a soul awakened in Love. May the Father’s Blessings be yours always, beloved souls. 
Beloved souls, seek the Light. Knock on that mighty door and all shall come to you beloveds. All shall come in time. God bless you and peace be with you beloveds. Peace, joy, love. God bless you.
