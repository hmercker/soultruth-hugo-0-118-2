# Quenching the Thirst of Your Soul

I am your teacher Augustine. May His Love find a lodgment within your souls, each one here, for His Love pours into this room at this time. I would deeply suggest that you open yourselves to receive this gift of Love. For God’s Love is everywhere. When you come together in a circle such as this, you draw in intensely this beautiful gift and light and you may drink deep of these waters, quenching the thirst of your soul, beloveds. 

God desires to make a connection with each one of you. Often within your soul is a deep desire to do so but you are often distracted by the material conditions of this world, by the many thoughts, actions, and the many influences that are a part of this condition, the human condition. So it takes your effort, it takes some discipline and it takes a deep desire to get beyond these distractions and come to a place of communion with God. So it is good when you come together in this way that you focus upon this effort, this prayer, this desire to receive the great blessing of the Father’s Love, for in this, all else follows. 

In this simple prayer come many blessings. In this desire comes the awakening of your souls as the Divine Love opens those faculties and capacities of your soul. As you push aside those mental conditions, those many thoughts, those things within you that draw you away from God to take time such as this, to take time each day when you come to a quiet place of prayer to be with God, to ask for this touch of Love, to know the peace that passes all understanding. These things God wishes to give to you, the healing of your bodies, peace to your minds, Love to your souls. 

This bounty of blessings is available to all who ask and are able to go beyond the condition of mind to a place of soul communion with God. It is not so difficult, my beloveds. It is not so difficult. It merely requires a focus and a desire and an expression of that desire in the form of prayer and all else comes into play. One begins to recognize and feel this great blessing, this deep peace, this sense of the Presence of God. May you do so this night. Receive all that God has to give to you, beloved souls. 

God bless you beloveds. God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine and I have a great love for each one of you, each beautiful soul and may you know this love in a profound and deep way. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
