Blessings of peace and Love be yours, my beloveds. I am Andrew. I have come to be with you in your prayers. 

Many angels surround you at this time, beloved souls, for as you beseech the Heavenly Father for His Love, so you attract the angels of Love from the Celestial Heavens. Know your longings, my beloved, know the longings of your souls, feel that yearning from within you that brings you a connection with your Heavenly Father. That Light bonds you together, opening you to His Holy Touch and bringing to you His Love through the Holy Spirit. 

Beloved souls, it is so important that you continue to long and pray for this great gift of Love, not only for yourselves and your wellbeing, but in so doing you bring Light to this world, a Light that is so needed, a Light that will bring healing and peace, that will reconcile the souls of humanity to God. Now more than ever, beloveds, now more than ever, humanity needs the Love, the guidance, the Light that comes from God to steer the course back into Light, to harmony, that mankind may know the Laws of His Creation, the Laws that will bring harmony, the Laws of Love. For so many are lost, so much of this world is out of harmony, so few understand why they are here, what is their purpose, what is the true meaning of their lives—so few understand and need the strength, the beauty and the grace that comes with this Light and this Love. You are needed, my beloved, you are needed. God will use you as His channels of Love in this world, His channels of Truth. Continue to pray for this great gift; continue to long for this blessing. God will guide you forward and use you as His instruments to bring this Light and Truth, to bring greater peace to this world. It is all part of a plan and each of you must be strengthened in Love, must be clear within your heart, must be sure within your mind of what is Truth and what is meant for you. Walk the Path Divine, beloved souls, walk in the Light and release all those burdens, all your worries and cares, and walk in the freedom and the joy that comes with this great Love and Light. So much God has to give to each one of you, so much awaits, so much awaits your longing, your desire, your openness, what can be given, nourishing your souls, nourishing you with Truth and Love, strength and wisdom. 

Be with God, my beloveds, be with God. God bless you. I am Andrew and I love you.
