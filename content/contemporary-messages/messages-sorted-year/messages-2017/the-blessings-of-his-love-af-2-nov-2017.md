God bless you, I am Seretta Kem. The Master Jesus loves you dearly beloveds. And he knows you well, and you know of him more than you might think. There are many in the world of spirit that you have known in your sleep states, many conversations and experiences together. As you come closer to the realization of the direct voice, so you will make contact with many more spirits who wish to utilize this opening, this portal of communication to mankind. So it is important that you establish these bonds with those beautiful spirits and angels who wish to speak. For in this connection of Love and response and trust that is building will come powerful manifestations and this gift. 

You are all making progress my beloved, beautiful friends. You continue to shed those old cloaks of understanding and feeling. You continue to pry open your eyes so that you may see clearly and to acknowledge the joy within your souls and we are continuing to work diligently with each one of you. Each of you are on a slightly different trajectory and path to come to that one place of unity where you require different elements and aspects of soul growth, physical healing, mental understanding and awareness. Each of you is unique and so we are working with you day and night that you may slough off those conditions that are not conducive to the opening of this Light and gift. And yes, we are blending chemicals amongst you, some of you are aware of this, as there are many energies and elements involved in preparing you for the development of this gift. It is very complex my beloveds and you must be patient and allow this work to continue at the highest level possible, to encourage Light within you and around you, to be with God like a constant prayer so that this Light from the Heavenly Father may infuse you and every cell and every part of you and that all will be uplifted, healed and brought into harmony. You are indeed making great effort, coming to a closer understanding of what is entailed in this venture. You will continue to climb ever higher to that place where God’s gifts and Love and power will manifest through you beloved souls. This cannot be restricted by the earthly conditions, by your own condition. It must come and be manifest in the purity of this Light, the beauty, the wonderment of God’s touch through you to the world. 

So you each understand and acknowledge that there is still a way to go in order to come to that place of pure Light and harmony. This is not easy within the world of the material, this is not easy. For very little here encourages what it is that you seek to do. You must be close to the angels, to the higher spirits who will carry you and protect you and enshroud you in Light, so that this pure Love, pure Light and pure energy will be manifest through you.

May you find that deep rapport with God and absorb all the wondrous Light and Love and blessings that God has to give to each one of you. For much awaits. It is like a dam filled with all of these blessings. It is for you to stand in front fearless as the barriers break and the Love pours upon you, this great washing of the living waters and blessings from God pouring over you, carrying you down the stream to where you must be so that you may serve, exhibit and demonstrate the Truth of God. May His wondrous blessings wash over you my friends, may you feel the great rush of the living waters cleansing and making you anew in the Light of God. May your souls yearn for this, may your minds come to desire this, and may all that stands in your way crumble and fall to dust. For God’s Hand may do this, and may take from you all that is not of His Creation. You need but pray for this, and to be willing and open to God’s waiting touch and gentle hand so that you may be deeply blessed beloveds, ever deeply blessed and uplifted into Light.

God bless you my friends. Seretta Kem is by your side and Loves you dearly. My precious brothers and sisters who seek Truth and desire Light and know of the Father’s Love. Deeply know of this Love. God bless you. God bless you beloved souls. God bless you.
