I am Seretta Kem who is with you. And so we begin this work. In those months past when the beginning of this effort was born and you each came forward and committed yourselves to work towards these ends, I say to you: “May God bless you abundantly that you were willing and are willing to be a part of this, to put aside all those activities and burdens upon your time that you may come together in dedication to one thing, to serve God in this way to bring forth a gift to humanity that Jesus and the angels may be allowed to speak in their own voice to the world.” 

How magnificent this will be, my beloveds. What a beautiful gift we all offer in our service to God. Each step that we will take together will be in Love and in harmony, in service and in Light. But God's Love will be the touchstone, God's grace will uplift us all and bring us to that place where we are together in loving harmony that we may work together in the flow and co-mingling of our energies, our gifts, our capacities to create and fulfill this desire for the Direct Voice. We have waited many years for this possibility and we are overjoyed that now there are a group of you who are willing to try to put forth their best effort to do so in faith and Love.

I wish to tell you that the angels are overjoyed and they are singing your praises, my beloveds. They are doing their utmost and I will tell you that all the angels in Heaven are praying for you. For to open this door, this portal of communication to the world will have a very important and powerful impact on the destiny of humanity. For never before has there been an opportunity to communicate in this way, in a consistent and powerful way available to every soul who wishes to see and to listen, to be aware, to comprehend the power of God's Love and the beauty of His creation, the beautiful souls of Heaven and those of you who wish to serve in Light and grace and humility. How this will change the world, my beloveds. Can you comprehend this? Are you able to recognize that you may be a part of this revolution of thinking, of understanding the world, the universe of God's creation? 

We love you for your innocence, my beloveds, your naivety, your hope and your faith and your desire to serve. How beautiful it is to see this manifesting through you, beautiful souls, who desire to come together and serve and to nurture this bud of opportunity, this gift awaiting. Beloved souls, we cherish you. We love you and we will do our utmost to bring forth this gift. We will work with you in many different ways as you are engaged in your prayers and your service, as you retreat to this chamber and willingly submit yourselves to the development of your capacities to bring forth this gift. Beloved souls, this will be the greatest adventure of your lives and it has the potential to change everything. Each of you, beloved souls, know within yourselves that you have - for a very long time - committed yourself to this, this great purpose. You have come to recognize what it is that God desires for you to do and what it is that your souls have acknowledged and agreed to in Love for your Heavenly Father.

You are loved. You will see as you progress in this development circle how truly loved you are and how powerful is your soul and the grace of God's Love. So we will walk together, hand in hand, helping one another to accomplish our goals to bring the highest and the most beautiful of fruits to humanity. God bless you. I remain your servant, Seretta Kem.
