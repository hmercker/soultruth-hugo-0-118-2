# What Brings Harmony in this World continued

September 16<sup>th</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C.

Received by A.F.

 

I am Martin Luther and I have returned to continue with my conversation [about what brings harmony to the world.](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2017/understanding-the-laws-of-love-and-the-regeneration-of-our-souls-af-12-sept-2017/)

I have mentioned that all of life in God’s Creation in the universe obeys cycles and rhythms and waves as energies cycle through, as events come and waves somewhat like the ocean that comes as a peak and a trough, so these energies peak and then wane, cycling over and over again. So it is with your own bodies, at times you feel more energy, more vitality, other times you need greater rest, quietness. As you nurture your bodies there is a greater vitality, that peak of energy increases. Yet you still must rest and be quiet. 

So it is with your prayers. Intensity wells up from within your soul and you seek God with this enthusiasm and desire. At times the connection that you make with God is intense and it nurtures you intensely, beautifully. There are times when you feel distant from God and you must make the effort to build up your connection and to release those conditions within you that are not in harmony. So it goes with each soul in this world; there are times of great joy, times of sadness, times of neutrality, times of passion. Cycles, beloveds, cycles, as you experience all of these aspects of life. When you choose to infill your being with negativity or disharmony and if so you set yourself upon another course, another cycle of energy, which must come back to harmony. 

The wonderful thing about Divine Love is that in this mere prayer and longing for Love, God’s Love, the energy that flows within your soul begins to right the disharmony within. It has its effect without your conscious effort to bring harmony. So we call this a gift because the power of Divine Love comes above the Laws of Compensation and Harmony in the natural cycle of things. So this Love is indeed unique and incredibly powerful. Given that you receive enough of the Divine Love, all that is not in harmony is made into harmony, is brought back to harmony. Is this not a wondrous thing, that these ordained cycles of life in your material world are changed by the power of Love? So as you move forward, the action of these conditions and cycles in this world are no longer so powerful in their effects upon your being. The power of Love instead brings a greater harmony, brings a richness of experience, an opening and flourishing of your souls. In time your souls do not become subject to these lower laws of creation. Is this not magnificent, that the power of Divine Love brings such rewards and blessings? 

For so many are subject to these Laws of Creation, are influenced by the cycles and waves of energies that inhabit every aspect of life. This is not to say that you are immune to these things for you, to some degree, must obey the Laws of Creation, but there is something else that is going on in your life, your being, that is informed by Love rather than your being in the body, soul and the spirit are informed by the natural conditions of life. Potentially, the obedience to these laws may be completely eradicated by the power of Love. It is possible, although very few attain such a level - the absolute healing of their souls and the great harmony of Love is all that is present in that soul. The Master Jesus attained this, but few have since done so. Although I do not say you are incapable of such a thing. It is merely determined by the power of your prayers, the efforts that you make, for God does not lift up a soul merely by His Will. It must be your desire, the power of your efforts in conjunction with God’s Touch upon you. So each soul works with God, God works with each soul, to bring this condition forward, the condition of Love, the power of Love.

But until that day of the redemption of your soul, you will be subject to the conditions and cycles of creation to one degree or another. In those times when you feel burdened, downtrodden, weak and in distress, realize that to some degree you are responding to the conditions of this world, the energetic cycles that are created, some of which are created by humanity, others created by the natural rhythms of this planet. Yes there are many aspects of life, many subtleties that you do not understand, yet everyone within this world is affected and influenced by them. As you grow in the Love, as you become changed and remade by the Love of God, you will find that these conditions will affect you less and less. You will not be subject to the inconveniences of these earthly conditions. As you become less affected, your gifts become stronger and they are independent of these earthly conditions and you will live in the flow of God’s influence. You are subject to God’s Touch and much Love. In this, many things are possible, many things. 

So you desire to express many gifts in this world, that whatever potential lies within your soul you have a desire to express, that they become awakened, your soul fully alive. All of this is determined by the power of this blessing of God’s Love. This one simple key and Truth opens the doors to many expressions, beautiful and wondrous within you. The potential of humanity is to change the conditions of this world through the power of their souls ignited by Love. This world can be a very different place, a place in much more harmony than it is at this time. And God asks you to inspire others, to speak of this Truth, the power of this Love, for it has far reaching effects and a wondrous potential to heal this world and bring harmony not only to the individual but to this planet. 

Those influences and cycles, energies that govern the operation of this world will be changed, transmuted in ways that I could not possibly describe to you at this point. So you must take my word for it, that the power of Love is great indeed and the potential of the influence of Love upon this world and each soul within it is beyond anything that you can imagine at this time. 

So our efforts and your efforts, God’s efforts are focused to these ends, to change the prevailing conditions of this world, to open up the possibilities to each soul to truly be awakened in Love that those great potentials of the soul may be realized and harmony may indeed reign throughout this world. What a wonderful goal this is. We all are putting forth our efforts and desires and gifts to these ends as God blesses each and every one of us, as we move forward and listen to His Will and come to know the possibilities and potentials that we carry, each one, within our souls.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Martin Luther. I am glad to speak to you today. As you change yourself, you are changing the world drop by drop, step by step. You are changing the world. May God bless you upon this journey that you may bring greater harmony and Light, the power of Love, that you may inspire so many to do the same, to follow this course, this path of Love. So we continue, beloved souls, upon this journey, so wondrous and awesome in its beauty and glory and power and perfection. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I will continue, as will many, to accompany you and guide you and pray with you and for you. God bless you. God bless you.
