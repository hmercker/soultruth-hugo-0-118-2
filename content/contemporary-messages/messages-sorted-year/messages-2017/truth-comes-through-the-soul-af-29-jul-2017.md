God bless you, beloved souls. I am Confucius. I hope that you can hear me. 

Each of you has a longing soul, my beloveds. Each of you is precious in the Eyes of God. Each of you is loved by God. When you come to know this Love that God has for you, beloved souls, it brings a great joy to your being. It brings to you a different perspective of life. For so many walk through their lives unknowing of why they are alive, what is the meaning and purpose of their life. 

Each of you here have a deep longing to know the answers to these questions, beloved souls. I tell you, beloveds, the answers do not come in the mind. What comes to the mind is mere speculation. It is trying to piece together many material thoughts to make an explanation that gratifies your minds. But your minds cannot come close to the Truth. It is your souls, beloveds. It is the perception and knowing of your souls that will bring you Truth that is solid as the ground you have your feet upon. So I applaud you, beloveds, that you come together to come to know your souls, for this is the first step in coming to know Truth, in answering those deep questions that all of you have. As you step forwards in the Light of your soul, you will come to Truth. You will come to know your true selves, you will come to that place of knowing God. For your souls have the capacity to know God in a deep and intimate way. As your eyes open, as Truth flourishes within your consciousness, you will find a deep change within you, a deep knowing of who you truly are, a deep knowing of why you exist, a deep knowing from whence you have come. 

These awareness come as God touches your soul with His Love, His Essence. Your soul is ignited in Love, your awareness expands in Love, and all meaning comes in Love. It is simple, beloveds. For Love is the greatest and highest power of the universe. Love is the Essence of God. God is Love. His Love, His Love for you, my beloveds, is great and deep, deep as the oceans, so great it is unfathomable, so immense His Love for each one of you, that you can never receive all of it. That Love shall envelop you and carry you and lead you into greater Light, into deeper awareness, into higher Truths. With this comes a deep peace, a profound joy. God calls each one of you, beloveds. God calls you to share in this bountiful Love, to be with God in this Love, and to be in the flow of His Love in your life, that mighty river that shall carry you to destinations yet unforeseen by your minds, but longed for by your souls. Beloved souls, know that at this moment you have the capacity to receive this great blessing. God’s Love surrounds you. Breathe it in, my beloveds, ask for its inflowing into your souls. Ask that you might know beyond a shadow of a doubt your own souls and that great purpose of each soul which is to find its at-onement with God. 

God bless you, beloveds. May you continue to create Light in this world, may your efforts be as a channel of God’s Will and Love in this world. May you hear His Whispers within your souls. May you know the guidance that God has for you, that you may live your lives upon the path of Light and Love. God has much to give, beloved souls. He is eager to give to you the great bounty of His Blessing if you but ask and are receptive to what is given.

God bless you, beloveds. The angels are with you. God is with you. You are in the Light. God bless you.
