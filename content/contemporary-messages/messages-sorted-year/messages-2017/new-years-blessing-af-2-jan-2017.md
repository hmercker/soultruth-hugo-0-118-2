# A New Year’s Blessing

January 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B.C. Canada

Received by A.F.

 

You have each received a deep healing this night, a blessing that has come with the angels and the prayers that you’ve made, and that deep and powerful portal of light that has been built from your efforts. It has brought a powerful wave of healing and many angels who are healers within your midst, bringing to you a strengthening of your bodies and a lightening of your souls.

Beloveds, carry on with your efforts, your prayers. Make this your daily focus, to be in God’s Light and Love, for as you do so, you will be a powerful channel for God. He will use you to touch many other souls. He has touched you deeply, and do you not want for others to be touched as well? Within their souls there is a yearning, a yearning for light; and you, my precious friends, must respond to this yearning by being close to God and allowing the touch and light of God to flow through you to others. Each day is an opportunity to be that channel of light, of love. Each day presents wondrous opportunities. Go with God. Go with the feelings within your souls. Come to know the guidance, the promptings, those subtle whispers which will guide you in life and bring you to those places where God wishes you to be in the flow of His Will and Love.

Many souls will be touched. Many blessings will be given. And you beautiful souls, will have the opportunity to serve God in this way. It is a dimension few acknowledge and understand. But you - you who have prayed for many years and you who are open to the possibilities of being a channel for God’s Love - will come to know, in a deep way, the power and the beauty of God’s Love flowing through you, His blessings flowing about you and reaching others. How blessed you are, and how blessed will be those who come upon your path. Allow the flow, unencumbered and powerful, to sweep through you and touch many. God needs your instrumentality, my beloveds. It is a powerful vehicle to bring light and healing, peace and love to this world - a world that is changing, a world that is evolving. And you have a part in this, a role to play. Continue to explore this and pray about this and come to know your purpose, which God has implanted within your souls. You will journey far into the realms of light, into the possibilities of being God’s instruments of change and healing and love. There is much for you to discover and much for you to do. This coming year will bring many, many opportunities for each one of you to bring light into this world. Be open to the possibilities. Open yourselves to God more fully, trusting in His Will and Wisdom and Purpose and Plan for you, my beloveds. Each one walks a unique path and is a powerful and beloved instrument of God’s creation. Continue in your efforts to be close to God, to be with God, to be true to yourselves; that soul within you bursting with light, eager to be expressed in your life; your precious soul, that powerful agent, that wondrous gift of God that brings life to you and your uniqueness and expression in the world.

God bless you, beloved souls. And may the Heavenly Father take you upon this journey and may it be straight and clear and powerfully effective in bringing light and healing and love to this world. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem, ever willing to assist you in your efforts together, bringing circles of light, portals of light, channels of light in God’s Name and Will and Love. Be at peace and know that God has a wondrous adventure in store for each one of you as you come closer to Him and are infilled with His Love and Essence. Beloveds, God bless you. God bless you. And good night.
