# The Time has Come to Listen to the Wisdom of Your Souls

I have come to comment upon this instrument’s physical condition. He experienced an episode this morning that was quite dramatic. He will continue to experience these episodes if he is not careful of the limitations of his diet. He cannot go through life expecting that these physical limitations are not relevant. 

If he is to continue to be an instrument for God, to travel this earth and to be a channel wherever he is guided to be then he must take into consideration the needs of his body and his spirit. He cannot pretend to be sensitive and attending to those needs for there will be consequences. The body responds with every act that you take in regards to its functioning in this earth plane. 

This, my beloveds, you must all take into account. A deep honesty on all levels is important for you to be in harmony, for you to be vital and for you to experience the joy of your own being. Like so many this instrument thinks more of others than himself. He finds more gratification in this loving flow, giving to others in whatever way he is able. Yet when it comes to his own self he does not leave much in reserve. A balance must be obtained, a balance of receiving and giving and of loving oneself. Yes, we have implored you to be a channel of Love in this world, to walk in Light, to give to others. Each of you does so in your own way. You all have generous hearts, my beloveds. You all walk in this world in the Light. But often you cannot see your own needs with clarity. Yet in the universe of God and His Love, Love must be given to all aspects of your life, including yourself. For when you love yourself, you say *‟I honour my existence, the creation that You have made, my dear Heavenly Father.″* 

It is often difficult to see through the conditions of this world in introspection, to see your own needs and to attend to yourself in love. The nature of this world is that it is very busy indeed, distracting your attention and bringing your focus outward. At times you even find it difficult to be in prayer. But you do find that time, do you not? Yes, you must find time to nurture your bodies, to be rested and to be in balance. For there is much work ahead of you, my beloveds, much work requiring a strong instrument, strong in every way, clear and in harmony and I know you are all making efforts to sustain your physical bodies in order to bring greater harmony. 

In the case of this instrument, one day of neglect brings its consequences. This is how precarious is his physical health at this time. Because we are developing him for his instrumentality in the future, he is more sensitive and will become more so as time progresses. Thus he must be more sensitive to his own needs and what is required. Yes you cannot pretend or ignore what is required. He, as well as all of you, know within your heart of hearts what is in harmony for you. It takes a strength, it takes a quality of love, to act upon this knowledge, this understanding and to bring greater harmony to yourselves. For as we have said very often, your soul knows what you need. Your soul consciousness will flood your awareness and provide for you the strength, wisdom, the Love that you require to adjust and change, to heal and to bring within yourself a greater vitality. 

So, first and foremost, you must nurture your soul. Bring within your soul that great blessing of Love from God. Walk in that Light with honesty and integrity, surety and self-love. As you refine these things within yourself, as the Love changes you, these qualities will shine forth as you walk in this world. These qualities will draw many to you for they will feel the power and the beauty of these aspects of your being. 

Given the appropriate efforts on your behalf in your prayers, listening to your own wisdom and guided by God, your body will change. You will be transformed in every way as the Love of God brings those changes, starting with your soul, manifesting outward your spirit, your mind and your body. Everything will change, beloveds, if you allow this and if you listen to the wisdom that is imparted to you by your soul, which has in turn been imparted to you by God. 

You are no longer babies upon this path. No, my beloveds, you begin to walk, to see the world differently. You begin to recognize how important it is to seek harmony in your lives, to walk in Light and to be close to God. Yes, for many years we have spoon fed many of you, patiently awaiting that time of a measure of maturity. That time has come. Like any parent, we allow you to walk and possibly fall, but we will never allow you to injure yourselves to any great extent unless, of course, that is your choice. But you must be strong beloveds, you must be strong, clear in your perceptions, wise in your actions, loving in all that you do. In this world this can often be a challenging thing, for often you are drawn into error and negativity without even knowing that you are there. Thus, you must be sensitive and aware of each step you take, each breath you make, each effort, each thought, those foods you put within your body. 

When your life is informed by prayer and the connection with the Creator this does not become a burden. It is not difficult when you and God are in harmony with each other. When you feel His Hand upon you firmly guiding you, you will just simply know what you must do with a surety and a strength, lacking ambivalence and gaining a clear vision. This, God wishes to give to you my beloveds. He wishes you to come to that place of clarity and strength, of expressing Love in every way in your lives. Prayer is your touchstone; prayer is where you begin, as you well know, pray to God to receive His Holy Essence, pray to be guided, strengthened, healed and uplifted. These prayers will be answered as long as they are sincere. 

Yes there are many things within you that do indeed need to be harmonized in Love and that you are not aware of. But this awareness will come. It will come as you incrementally step into the Light. Incrementally the Love of God heals and opens you to the Truth, for it is Truth that you truly seek. It is Love that carries you there. It is hope and faith and joy that grows upon your journey. Continue beloved souls to walk in the Light as best you can, to accept the Will of God, to know the Will of God and to bring the Will of God within your lives more fully with each day. 

We will be with you, beloveds, for we continue to nurture you, often like a parent towards its child. But I tell you, our love is far greater than this. Our desire to see you grow and to be beautiful flames of Love in this world is immense. So I wish you to know, my beloveds, that every small step that you make towards Love and harmony gives us joy and pleasure unimaginable. We will continue to support you upon your journey and to keep you embraced in Love and Light, to protect and guide you as you continue to find your way in the forest of the human condition. We will light the way. God will give you what you require to traverse through this forest to those beautiful fields of Light and harmony.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am your teacher, Augustine. I love and cherish each one of you. I do see great progress has been made and much more will be made as you continue to test your limits, seek your truth, learn how to love yourselves and others, and to seek out at-onement with God. We witness this miracle in each one of you. What a blessing, what a gift, what a beautiful journey, beloved souls. We are with you. I love you. God bless you.
