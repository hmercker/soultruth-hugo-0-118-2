You prepare a place for many, my son (A). Your efforts will bring great rewards and you feel the guidance that brings you to this effort and work. I, too, was a carpenter. I, too, understand the satisfaction that comes with building, creating something in this way. Many will appreciate your efforts and you will be able to open doors to a place that brings comfort and love, that brings a steadiness and a surety to those who are seeking the truth. God has blessed this place, your home. All that is here has been blessed, and many come and feel this blessing and feel comforted by it. There are many who are coming whom you do not know at this time, but will continue to make themselves known to you. You will feel compelled to bring them into your midst, to pray and to be a channel of Love to those who are seeking, those who are in need, those who are curious, those who have a deep desire to know God. You will recognize this and find a deep satisfaction in your relationships with these souls who come and share themselves with you and you with them, so that spiritually you will understand one another and work together in relationship with the Will of God. 

So much is coming beloved souls, so much. You will be ready. You will be prepared. You will express your strength, your faith and your knowledge and your love. Others will recognize this and feel the power of God's Touch within your souls. Such are the Plans of God to bring to His Children the succour that they require, the Truth that will set them free, away from their dilemmas and their suffering. You will find opportunities with each day to do this work, to touch others in Love and Truth, and healing and peace. 

Continue to draw the Father's Love within your souls and know that this is the key. This is the source of all of your gifts, the true strength within, the light. The wonderment that is your creation is enlivened by the power of Love. Walk in this Light. Walk in this Light. Beloved children you are blessed. You are truly blessed. I am Joseph, the father of Jesus and I too accompany you upon your journeys. God bless you. God bless you and keep you with God always, always.
