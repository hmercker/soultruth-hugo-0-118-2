Bless you children, I am Confucius. Yes the Light grows bright amongst you beloved souls, very bright indeed. As you make your prayers and efforts known to God, so His response pours upon you, uplifting you and bringing great blessings to your souls. 

Continue to bring harmony amongst yourselves and to focus your thoughts upon God. The efforts that you aspire to, those great ventures, shall come forth with the fruits of your labors, beloved souls, the fruits of your labors shall come as you and all of those in spirit join together to bring Truth to this world in wondrous ways. Manifestations glorious to behold, Truths spoken clear and profound await. It comes, beloved souls, on the wake of your yearnings and your desires. God’s Hand is firmly upon you all and uplifting all that you do, bringing deep peace, great joy to your hearts, understanding to your minds and Love to your souls. Continue beloved souls in all that you do. These blessings reach deep within you. God bless you. I am Confucius. I Love you beloveds. I Love you deeply.
