Â 

Beloved souls, I am Mother Teresa. Yes I understand service. My life was service, and yes, God blessed me deeply as I helped the lost souls in this world. There is always much work to do my friends, always much to do, for no one can remain idle when there is so much work and so many souls to tend to. As God guided me forth, so He will guide you, my beloved souls, beautiful lights in this world. Do not limit the possibilities of your service to God, for these possibilities are endless and limitless. It is only you that sets limits. It is only your ideas of the mind that desires to put shape to what you will do in service. When you serve God and serve humanity in love, it is your soul that finds its expression, its beauty and its purpose. That joy that comes, that recognition deep within you will find its way and blossom forth, where all that you do will be an expression of joy, of love and of service to mankind. The world needs you beloved souls. The world needs many, many more like yourselves who are seeking to slough off the chains of error, the reticence to serve and to love.

Free yourselves precious souls and allow God to work through you, for in this way miracles can happen, wondrous works to behold. Love, love in everything. God bless you my friends. I too wish to speak to humanity some day. May your ventures come to fruition. May your service to God always bring greater light to the world. I will pray for you and I will come to bring my love and support to you beautiful souls and maybe some day you will come to that country, India, to bring truth and light, hope and love to the lost souls who reside there. God bless you. God bless you for everything that you do. Please continue your work. So much to be done. God bless you beloved souls. My love is with you. God bless you.
