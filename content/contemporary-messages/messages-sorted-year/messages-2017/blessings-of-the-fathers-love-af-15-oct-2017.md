Bless you beloved souls, I am John, John the Beloved.

May the blessings of the Father’s Love capture your souls, envelope your souls in this Holy Light and bring your consciousness to that place where you may acknowledge this gift and feel the presence of God. For God wishes for all His children to know Him, to be in harmony with His laws of creation and to receive the bounteous blessings of His Gift of Love and comfort, healing and peace. For these blessings, beloved souls, come to those who seek and desire to receive. Ask for the blessings from God. They are limitless.

God wishes for each of His children to be sustained in this Light and to come to Him often so that they may be fulfilled within their souls and know the joy of the Father’s blessings.

Beloveds, know the Touch of God. Feel the Grace of God and receive His great blessings in your souls and you will begin a journey like none other. You will know a Light, a Truth, an awakening of your souls that fulfills that deep desire within you for Truth.

Beloveds, may the peace that passes all understanding be with you. May you know that God is with you now, shall carry you Heavenward to that place of Light. God bless you beloveds. God bless you.
