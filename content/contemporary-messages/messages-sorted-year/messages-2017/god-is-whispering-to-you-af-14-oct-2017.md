I am Jesus. May the Father’s Love find a constant inflowing into your souls. May His Peace be with you always beloveds and may you come to know your Heavenly Father. May you know His Will and feel His Love for each one of you, for His Love flows and touches your souls. His Blessings, abundantly are within your lives, beloveds. Seek to know your own souls, to truly know your true selves, to follow the yearnings of your heart, to be an instrument of light and a channel of Love and God will guide you in all the days of your life. God will touch you each day, each moment, with His Love, His Guidance and His Care and Protection for He wishes to give all gifts and lessons to His children. Reach to God my beloveds, reach for His Blessings. Pluck the fruit from His tree of life and soon these gifts of Love will truly be a part of you, beloved souls, and your lives will open, you will truly understand who you are. You will come to know God, intimately, powerfully, and joyfully. 

You’ve been brought together beloved souls for a purpose. There is much work to do, there is much for you to understand and to acknowledge so that you may be a part of this great plan to bring greater light and Truth and harmony to this world so in need of the Father’s Blessings. 

I have been with each one of you, beloved souls. I have touched you with blessings to awaken your souls, to bring to you clarity and the sense of what you are meant to do in this world. This will come more powerfully as you progress upon your path in this life. There will be no doubt or confusion but merely a desire and acknowledgement of what you are meant to do. 

God works upon your soul. He opens your awareness through igniting your soul with His Love. And that true and deep awareness brings much knowledge and understanding which will come into your mind, inspire your vision and bring you to a place of knowing and joy. Seek God in your prayers my beloveds. Seek to know within your hearts what God has to give you. His Blessings, His sweet inspiration, His Love and all will follow from this. All will follow in good time.

But you must make time, my beloveds, to be with God, to perk up your ears, to open your eyes, to acknowledge the desires of your soul and to be in communion with the Creator. Without this, nothing can be truly known, blessings cannot flow, purpose cannot be fulfilled, without this deep and powerful connection with God. For we all act within the flow of His Will and are truly with God. For you in this world it is challenging to truly know, to be in that communion, that flow and harmony to be with your Creator at all times. But as you progress in this Love, as you are given the blessings that come with your prayers and your desires of the soul, all is revealed, it comes more readily, you see more clearly, you Love more easily and harmony ensues as Love infuses your soul.

Make this a focus in your life. Seek this blessing always, and we in the Celestial Heavens will accompany you upon this journey of discovery and understanding. This we promise you, that we will walk by your side at all times. We will help you to understand and to see the steps you must take. And as you come closer to God many things will manifest in your life which God has orchestrated and blessed you with. Rather than your own plans, you come to know God’s plans and come to accept joyfully the Will of God. And then truly the adventure begins, as God guides you day by day, as you hear the voice of Truth and wisdom that bubbles forth from your souls. In this way, all that is in harmony unfolds beautifully and is within that great river of God’s Love carrying you forth, carrying you forth to destinations yet unknown to you, but not to God. May your faith and your love and your strength all work in this great flow to bring harmony within your lives and service to your brothers and sisters. For there is a great hunger in this world, a great deprivation of Love, confusion, error and pain. So much that does not need to be so but is so because mankind is lost, and God is seeking channels of Love, instruments of light to bring greater Truth to this world and to lead many out of these dilemmas and this pain, to a life more in harmony with the laws of creation. You each feel a yearning to serve God in this way. Remember my beloveds, the Will of God is quiet, yet powerful. One must listen and yearn to know. It does not shout, it is not insistent, but it is pure. And it is powerful for those who are willing and who have a deep faith and knowledge of God. 

Will you step forward beloved souls to seek the Will of God? To yearn for the blessing of His Love that will truly transform your souls and set you upon a journey like none other. A journey of Love, a journey of awakening. And thus the world will look different to your eyes. What you think you need and must do will change and you will see a new world opening to you, a world with many possibilities and potentials. A world which your soul recognizes, a world in which the gifts of your soul may flourish. That you may truly live in harmony with God as the power of His Love transforms everything. 

Will you walk with me beloved souls into the future? And as this world changes and responds to God’s Touch upon it, will you walk with God? Will you seek to understand His Will? Will you take the journey that is destined by God? It is your choice beloved souls. It is your choice. I urge you to listen to your own hearts. To understand from that place deep within you, what it is you truly wish to do, where you wish to go and how God is whispering within you, what you need to know to understand and to see. For as you comprehend the Will of God, so the journey ahead will open to you and you will truly know with joy and acknowledgement the Will of God. 

Bless you, my beloveds. I am with you as you aspire for light and Truth, goodness and Love, I am with you. And may you continue to open to the wonderment of God’s Creation and the wonderment that is truly who you are. May your souls expand in Love, may your minds accept what your souls know and may you feel that inner joy, that deep reckoning that comes as God touches you deeply.

I am with you, I will continue to be with you, beloved souls. As you continue on this journey of awakening, I am with you. God bless you beloveds. I Love you, Love you dearly. God bless you. I am Jesus, God bless you.
