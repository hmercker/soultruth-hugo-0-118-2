Â 

God bless you, beloveds. Yes, this instrument will continue to become familiar with many other angels from the Celestial Kingdom. Often it is difficult to discern the names of those individuals, those angels that come. We will help him to be clear in his understanding and perception of these individuals and know their names. It is difficult because of the portions of the material brain that are used to bring forth verbal communication for such names needs to be clear.

Yet he continues to forge ahead in his gifts. Clarity will come, as will a sense of confidence concerning who is overshadowing him. Because some spirits are unfamiliar there is sense of hesitancy. I must reassure him that his guides and gatekeepers will continue to ensure that those who come through him are of the highest, and of importance, and part of the Plan. So he is not to worry or be concerned as to what is coming through, but be an open and trusting individual. God will ensure that all that comes is for a purpose and a blessing.

Thank you, beloved souls. May God bless you. May His Love continue to flow into your souls in great abundance. I am your teacher Augustine and ever by your side as you continue to serve God in this way. Many blessings to you, beloved souls, and to all those who are connected to this great venture of bringing the Truth of God's Love to this world. All are blessed in this effort. All are blessed. God bless you.
