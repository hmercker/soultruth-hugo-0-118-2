I will bring you together, my children.  I am Mary and I come to tell you that I will bring you together from time to time. It is important that you have this time together for each contributes, adds to the whole and brings a greater Light to this world, and to yourselves. God has brought you together and you will continue to come together at various times in your lives to replenish, to contribute your knowledge, to be in that Light together, to affirm your progression, to take note of your love bonds together and to strengthen these bonds. For there will be times in the future where you will need one another, and you will help one another, and you will assist in this work to bring healing to this world. 

Beloved souls, you are cherished by God, each one of you. Beautiful souls in the world, continue in your efforts, your desires to be a channel of Love and we will continue to support you in this and God will continue to bless you mightily. We thank you for your efforts each one, for your loving counsel to one another, for the love that you have shared, how you have brought in those souls who are hungry. You will continue to gather the souls and bring this simple Truth to the hearts of many. And I will watch over you, my beloveds, as you work and serve God in Love. 

God bless you. I am Mary. And I love you dearly. God bless you, Beloveds.
