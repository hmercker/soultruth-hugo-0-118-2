I am Keea-atta Kem. I have always Loved you and will always. And for some of you I have been with you for many years. In fact, with some I have been with you all your life. And this relationship will continue to grow, and deepen and expand, for I have much to teach you my friends, much to give in Love. I have great anticipation and excitement as to what may come in the future - that we may work together to teach many souls of the Father’s Love and the beauty of the Father’s Creation and the wonderment that is Light.

Yes God lays a great ribbon of Light in front of you that will carry you forth to many destinations and experiences and hungering souls and beautiful expressions of Love. It will all flow within the will of God so harmoniously, with such beauty and grace. Let go of all your worries and cares beloved souls, for God has you firmly in His grasp. You are richly blessed and you are beautiful indeed. God bless you and I Love you.
