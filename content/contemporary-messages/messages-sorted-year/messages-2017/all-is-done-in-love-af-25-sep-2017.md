Â 

You forge a path where mysteries are no longer mysteries and Truth is obvious for those who have eyes to see. You will bring forth these Truths. You will help to open the eyes of those who wish to see. Thus, you forge the path for others. 

Many will follow, for this world must change and God is inspiring those souls who seek to be a part of this change, who desire to be in harmony with God and with Truth, who bring with them Love and express what they have to give, their precious gifts, to their brothers and sisters.

You are blessed, my brothers and sisters, you are blessed. God will continue to uphold you and guide you upon the path you are destined to follow. All is done in Love. All is expressed in Light. Such is your journey as you forge the path to God. 

God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you. I hold you close. You are precious to me. You are blessed in Love.
