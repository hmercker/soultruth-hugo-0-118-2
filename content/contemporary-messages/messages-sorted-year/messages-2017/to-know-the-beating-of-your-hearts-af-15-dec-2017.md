Â 

I am Seretta Kem. I have said many things to you over these weeks, so I need not say much other than how much I Love you and will continue to be with you. How much joy I feel to see your Light and to know the beating of your hearts. To know and to witness your struggles and your triumphs. What a gift it has been for me to accompany you upon this journey and I will continue wherever it may take us, I will be with you. I will continue to support, to teach, to assist you to greater heights and glories and Light and Love. 

God bless you my friends and I Love you.
