First United Spiritualist Church, Burnaby, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike.

 

God bless you precious souls. May His Light and Peace and Love descend upon you and envelop you and carry you as you venture out into this world. I want you to know that each of you is loved by God. Each of you is cared for by your Heavenly Father. Each of you may receive all the blessings that you desire from God, for the bounty of God’s Soul is infinite and His blessings upon each of His children knows no bounds. 

Beloved souls, I urge you to pray to receive the Holy Essence of God into your souls and to walk in this Light, for it will carry you to at-onement with the great source of All, the Light of a Thousand Suns, the Source of that endless river of Love. It is yours for the asking, beloved souls and it is possible for each of you to receive. It is a choice, it is a gift, and it is available to all. 

Beloveds, may your souls be open to the inflowing of this great Essence and may you feel the Touch that comes with this Gift and know the certainty that you are loved and that you are a child of God, a soul precious beyond, a soul of Light. 

God bless you beloveds. I am Jesus and I will lead you into this holy Light if you but follow this simple prayer and open yourselves to what God may give to you. I love you beloveds, I love you. God bless you.
