Â 

It is Mary and I come to bless you for the efforts that you make and the love that you have for all the children and the love that you have for one another. You are my daughters and sons. I embrace you as your mother and I embrace you as a child of God. You will carry the message of Truth. Indeed, you carry the Truth of His Love within you. May these living waters pour from you, my beloveds, as a channel of God's great Love for humanity. Yes, blessed are the water carriers, those who bring Truth and transform error to Truth, pain to Love, darkness to Light - all through the Hand of God upon you.

God bless you, beloveds. Know that I am always with you in my love and that I see your light. You are beautiful, each one of you. I see your light. I love you. God bless you.
