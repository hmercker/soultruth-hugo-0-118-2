Â 

God bless you. I am your teacher Augustine. I wish to acknowledge all of those souls who have prayed with you from many places. They have dedicated their time, their efforts in support and prayer and Love. They have also been carried along this journey of awakening and have felt the blessings of God. For their hearts are pure and keen to bring this gift forth and to grow within their souls and to serve God. Each one a beautiful soul, each one giving of themselves with such Love and dedication and desire to support you all in your efforts for direct voice. 

They will be blessed, they have been blessed and they are blessed. The angels are with them, each one and they will find their expression to serve God in their way, their purpose and their destinies. For God uses His children who so desire to be His instruments in this world, channels of Love. And so this will be, this will be, now and in the coming times. God bless all those who seek to serve God in this way. To seek His Love, to walk the Light of the Divine path. God bless, God bless you all. Your teacher Augustine Loves you dearly. God bless you.
