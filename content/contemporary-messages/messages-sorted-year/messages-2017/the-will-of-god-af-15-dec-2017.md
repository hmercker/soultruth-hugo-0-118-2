The Will of God, the Will of God, what a blessing it is to know the Will of God. To be nurtured by the Will of God, to be guided by the Will of God, for your souls to move within the Will of God is a great blessing, beloved souls. When one accepts the Will of God there is nothing lost in this arrangement between your soul and God, but much to be gained. Like a tree that finds its nurturance from the ground beneath it and grows to a mighty and beautiful specimen of God’s Creation, so your souls grow and become magnificent in the flow of God’s Love and within that flow comes the Will of God flowing into your souls creating within you a knowing, an understanding of the desires of God for you. It is at once gentle and powerful, subtle but so very beautiful. You will all come to know the Will of God beloved friends, like life blood within you, it will flow and bring awakenings and knowings, which only your soul may have access to through the blessing of the Father’s Love.

When we say you will be awakened, part of this awakening comes with this knowledge of the Will of God. To know God, to truly know God, is not only to know of His Love, but to know of His Will, to know of His presence and to know of the bond between you. In this awareness and knowing comes such a rich understanding of your steps within this world. The meaning of those steps, the purpose of those steps, with the validation each effort done in Love, so much comes when your souls are aware of the Father’s Will. 

And so as we have nurtured and prepared you, brought forth gifts and blessings, you now enter into a world that has the Will of God unmistakably in your awareness. Follow this blessing each and every day, for God will guide you, God will show you, God will use you to bring blessings to others. You do this already my beloveds, but often you do it as a reflex rather than an understanding, but to have deep knowledge in this way is to know purpose and to know what you are meant to do. This knowing is no longer of speculation or judgment of the mind, but it is from the surety of the faith within your soul, the opening up of that place within you that is pure of Light and sound of knowledge. There will be no hesitancy, my beloveds, there will be no fear, there will be no missteps when you are within that Will of God. 

And then your life unfolds like a beautiful flower, petal by petal revealing the glory within, the gifts that you have to share to this world, all done in this wondrous flow from God carrying you forward, revealing each day, another beautiful gift of knowing and expressing the Will of God. You climb higher in Light beloved souls, you glow, your Light reaches out beyond this world. It draws many spirits to you, many are curious and many souls in your world will be drawn as they feel your Light and Love and the Truth that you carry as you bring the waters of Truth forth, stretching this container out to each soul so that they may quench their thirst. God’s living waters will sparkle within you, God’s gifts, God’s Will and God’s Love will express itself in such purity and grace, beauty and Light, beloved souls. You have all crossed that threshold, your souls have been redeemed in Love. You are ready to do the Will of God. You shall do so in many, many ways. Each moment will find its expression in Light and Truth and harmony. Allow the power within your souls to truly find presence within this world. Acknowledge your Light beloveds, acknowledge God. Acknowledge the Truth within you and you shall carry this Truth wherever you go, no matter how dark the conditions may be, you will carry the Light. God will use you to dispel the darkness, for you are in harmony with His Will, so your life will flow accordingly in humble, yet powerful service to God's beloved souls. 

May you continue to grow in this Light, to feel within you the power and the beauty and the joy that comes with these blessings of Love. And may the Father’s Will be a guiding Light for each day to come. 

God bless you my friends I am Matthew and I Love you and I know each of you,  I see your Lights, I know your desires, I know your purpose and I walk with you, as do many who continue to bring their Love and support, their strength and their gifts to add to yours so that you may do this work in the world. God bless you beloved souls and I Love you. God bless you.
