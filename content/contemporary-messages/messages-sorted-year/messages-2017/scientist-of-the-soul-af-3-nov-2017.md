Â 

I am Marie Curie. Yes my understanding of the world is so much deeper than it was. And I am so excited for your efforts for the world needs to know these Truths. The world needs to understand that to bring Truth, real Truth to humanity, each must become a scientist of the soul. That in this all things flow, all things will come as one reaches to the Source, that great Light that emanates in the universe that is God. So much can be accomplished and understood, so much. 

I will not keep you further, but I too wish to speak with direct voice. Many scientists have much to contribute in this regard. God bless you my beloved friends. I Love you too. God bless you.
