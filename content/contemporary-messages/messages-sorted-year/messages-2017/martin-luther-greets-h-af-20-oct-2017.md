I am Martin Luther. We will continue in our efforts to bring messages that will teach others as you pray together outside of your direct voice circles. There will be messages prolific, for there are still many things which need to be addressed, to teach others. For when this gift of direct voice is accomplished you will garner much interest in this world and you must present to those who are curious, who have a deep desire for knowledge and truth. In many cases you must first feed their minds so that they are comfortable to nourish their souls in this way of prayer and so we will give teaching messages as you are together in prayer. 

There are many ways that we may utilize these opportunities when you are together in your loving prayers, bringing this great light into your midst. We will not waste any opportunities as I’m sure you have a deep desire to bring what can be accomplished forward and to do so in the flow of God’s Love. We will not overtax this instrument or any of you in the process. So in this regards they must be patient and allow what is meant to come through in harmony to be done in accordance with what is possible and what is most proficient in accomplishing all of our tasks and goals together. 

We will all be swept up, beloved souls, in the beautiful touch of God and we will not know precisely what is possible until we are all together in our efforts and prayers. We too have great excitement and joy at the possibilities that may come in this time. There is one thing that you can certainly expect and that is that you will be growing within your souls, that you will be uplifted, that you will be changed by this experience. There will be a greater clarity for each one who participates – where there is a sort of delicate balance that each is trying to accomplish in their lives, bringing greater light and living their lives with fervency. There will be a strength that will come within each one of you and a clarity that will not give way to doubt and confusion but to a true understanding, a soul awareness of the Will of God. In this, as you continue journeying in your life serving God, you will recognize with the utmost of clarity the opportunities that God will place before you in service. Even if this gift of direct voice is not accomplished, you will go forth in the world as truer servants of God and disciples of the Master Jesus in this world. So, no matter what the outcomes with your direct voice efforts – and I must say we are encouraged that you will be successful, you will be entering into a new phase of your life and service for God and it will be magnificent. 

You are held tightly by God. You are nurtured and protected, loved and blessed. You will not fail in your desires to bring the truth of God’s Love to mankind. You are truly a part of His plan and you will not fail, you will move forward in dramatic and surprising ways, outcomes that are unanticipated, surprises and opportunities unimagined. You will meet many souls in this world, some who are leaders in this world and known well in this world and many who are your brothers and sisters in this world living as they may, struggling in the light, seeking to dispel the darkness.  God wishes for you to touch many, many souls as His channels of Love, and you will, my beloveds. Your strength builds with each day, your gifts unfold and your love grows. This is what is required and you are following the Will of God in many, many ways. You build a light within you through your prayers, through your desires and through your yearnings to God. The world of God continues to open to your consciousness. What you see now is a glimpse into what is coming and it is coming rapidly and forthrightly to this world and you will be ready for what is to come.

God bless you beloveds, I am Martin Luther. I will be with you my beloved daughter for all the days of your life and there are many days to come beloved daughter, many days to come. Know that I stand by your side and I will guide and protect, I will encourage and pray with you for I love you deeply beloved daughter. Such a light, you are such a beautiful light and God loves you so, as do I and many others. God bless you beloveds, God bless you.
