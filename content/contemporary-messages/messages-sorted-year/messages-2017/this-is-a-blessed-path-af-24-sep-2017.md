I am with you, my beloveds, I am with you in your efforts and I shall speak through the mediums for Direct Voice. I will appear to all who are present that they may see my person and know my voice and Love and Light. Remember this, my beloveds, though you must pray hard and seek to be ever closer to God so these gifts may manifest through you. There is great purpose, a great purpose and reward for these efforts as you continue to strive for the highest, the greatest good, the Truths of Love.
