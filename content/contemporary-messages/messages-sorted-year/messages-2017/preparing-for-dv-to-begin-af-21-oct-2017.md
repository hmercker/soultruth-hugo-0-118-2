God bless you. We will be addressing your circle tomorrow and each of us will say some words of encouragement. You are a part of your circle and are a special partner in this with each one of you and those who are coming and thus we will begin our efforts. My daughter you are correct in your assumptions that it will require a special dedication amongst you to create and maintain the conditions and power that is required for us to accomplish these tasks and development within you. None is more important or special than the other. You are all required to be present and are equal in your tasks and purpose here, for without the harmony amongst you and the sense of at-onement and singleness of purpose, we cannot accomplish what we have set out to do. So I do not suggest that each individual must spend each day, each hour together, but that their focus and thoughts and intentions play primarily with the task at hand. There will be more guidance on the morrow. 

There has been a great deal of preparation on our side of life to help to sustain you, and encourage you upon your development and efforts together. So we do not ask a great deal from you, merely that you consider that this is a special time in your life, something unique and very important that will open many doors of service and opportunities of love. Is this not our focus and purpose to bring greater love to this world, to bring greater truth, to serve God in love and to serve humanity in love? Is there any higher calling, beloveds? Is there any greater task than to be God’s instruments and channels of Love in this world?

So you have answered the call, you have made your dedication in prayers and you have made your efforts to be here. So as you walk through the threshold, keep a prayer of thanks to God and feel the excitement well up within your soul in acknowledgement that God has brought you together yet one more time for another purpose, another task and another effort that fulfils the plan of God. God bless you beloveds. I will continue to speak to you and to assist you as we take this journey together. My wish is that I may help you to see more clearly what it is that we are doing together and how your tasks may be fulfilled.  

You have many questions some of which would be difficult to explain, but many things we can reveal as we go along and we will be glad to do so. Some of you – your minds are as thirsty as your souls and we understand. I too have a great curiosity and studied for many, many years with great fulfilment in understanding the intricacies of God’s creation. What you are about to encounter are further revelations of the potentials that God has put within each one and how His Love may spark these gifts and potentials to life. So, we will continue on this journey and feast upon the wonderments of God’s Creation, His Blessings, His Love – succouring the mind and the soul, bringing revelation upon revelation, truth upon truth and the wisdom will grow within you, beloved souls. Let your eyes open and your souls awaken. So, it will be for all eternity, my beloveds. This journey never ends. What you seek to know today is but a drop in the ocean of the knowledge of God. God bless you beloveds; my love is with you. I am Seretta Kem. I love you. God bless you.
