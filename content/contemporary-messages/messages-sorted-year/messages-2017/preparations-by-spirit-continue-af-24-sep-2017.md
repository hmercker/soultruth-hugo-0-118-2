We continue to prepare you, each one, even those who are travelling. We continue to work with you and encourage you to bring your soul conditions to a higher place, to a higher level. As you continue to pray for the Father’s Love, the Father pours His love within you and assisting you in your efforts to clear away those obstacles and conditions that may impinge upon your efforts for Direct Voice.

Yes, there is much preparation to be done. We also are utilizing this instrument to bring teachings forth at this time, for when your work begins there will be little time for these sorts of communications. Your focus will be upon the task at hand. You will be doing much travelling. You will meet many, many souls in this world who will be curious and intrigued. Some will have a deep soul desire to know these Truths for they will be inspired by the gifts that you carry and the Love that you have within your souls. Yes, your life is about to change, my beloveds. This requires a deep commitment, a profound understanding of what it is that you have embarked upon in this journey, this journey to bring the Truth to mankind.

God will provide the power and the blessings needed for your success. At this time you are clearing away all those obstacles that may inhibit the flow of these gifts and blessings from God. So you need to be in deep prayer each day. You need to set aside your fears, and set aside those conditions within you that you are well aware are not in harmony with God’s Love and the Laws of His Love. For if you are to be an ambassador of this Truth, you must live accordingly and exemplify this Truth in every respect. We see within each one of you a great potential to do so. But all is predicated upon your free will, your desire to rise above the human condition and to allow God to work through you in that flow of Love and Light, Truth and goodness, joy and enlightenment. Yes indeed a great responsibility rests upon you but you have chosen to do so, you have chosen to take part in this work and effort.

So much is coming, my friends, many changes, unheard of opportunities, profound experiences and wondrous blessings. A great and powerful flow of Love will accompany you and embrace you in all of your efforts as you move in the world. You will be accompanied by millions of angels and you will be protected and guided. Each one of you has an important part to play in this. You begin to become aware of this, to see your own self and the gifts that you carry and how God may use you as His channels of Truth and Love. Never before have the angels been so intensely involved in the affairs of this earth. Rarely do we get the opportunity to come to this place in such strong rapport. Few have invited us through the longings of their soul for God’s Love. But you have overcome all those barriers and vices and errors so that you may make rapport in this way, in a powerful way and be used in this wondrous gift of Direct Voice.

Remember, my beloveds, each one of you carries a power and a gift that complements the whole. You must take your part and responsibility seriously and realize that none has greater gifts than the other, merely different. You must love and support one another in this. Do not let the human condition stifle your efforts. Be sincere with one another and sincerely loving. Embrace one another because you are truly brothers and sisters in this effort. God has brought you together to find your way and to open a door that will open many doors.

Many of the angels will come to speak through this gift of Direct Voice. We have introduced several to you at this time and more are coming to make rapport with you so that they may come and speak more readily to those who will gather to listen. This is all part of the plan, beloved souls. We continue to orchestrate what is required. We merely ask you to listen, to follow your heart, to speak from your soul, to desire to serve God and your brothers and sisters in this world. With this desire is the key to unlock the door to bring these bounteous blessings forward.

Remember the power of your own choice with each moment. Remember that the time for old habits, negative thoughts, judgments and unloving conditions within you – the time has passed. It is time to choose Love always, to express yourself in harmony with Love. You have the capacity to do so for have you not been taught of God’s Love? Have you not been well blessed with these bounteous waters of life? Have you not been healed and nurtured and carried and accompanied by angels? There is no reason for you to feel weak and incapable of Love. For everything you require is within you and you are protected and surrounded in Light. There is no reason to express anything but Love. If you do so, if you feel inclined to choose negativity over Love then I ask you to say a prayer for yourself and ask God to help you to overcome these conditions that no longer truly are a part of you. They are remnants of an old time in your life.

Your soul continues to be reborn in Love. This is what is meant to come forward in your life at this time and to say to yourself and to God: *“I have outgrown these old things. Now, Father, help me to let them go truly and forever for I need not these old crutches, these old thoughts, these old feelings for I am now Your child and Your instrument and a soul claimed by Your Love. May I claim my birthright? May I walk in this Light forsaking that which is not of Light and claiming that which is of Light and Love and harmony and peace, joy and wonderment.”*

For, my beloved souls, the time has truly come for you to step forward in Light, to acknowledge what this means and to step forward with the full realization and responsibility that comes with this choice. You cannot fool yourselves, beloved souls. You must be truthful and honest and forthright. If you feel unworthy, this is illusion for you truly are worthy. You are worthy within your souls and it is your true self that will tell you so. If you hide behind this feeling of unworthiness, you do yourself a great disservice for your mind plays tricks upon you as it continues to be influenced by the conditions of this world. Yet you are truly free from this within your soul and you need to acknowledge and accept this Light that burns within you. May you continue to shine bright, to find your way to God in all its fullness and richness and beauty. Let go of the vestiges of an old self no longer needed, no longer relevant and accept with joy the newness of your brilliant soul.

It comes to you, beloved souls. God continues to pour His Love upon you and lift you above and bring you to that place of awakening. So it will come and so you will emerge as your soul comes fully to life. What wonderment that will be, what gifts shall emerge, and such beauty shall be expressed. The power of God’s Love, His Essence changes everything, the beauty of this transformation, the wonderment of a soul redeemed and the joy that comes with this awakening. So much awaits you, my beloveds, so much as God gifts you with everything and you need not for anything but your relationship with God. 

God bless you, beloveds. I am Seretta Kem and I continue to serve you and to assist you in this transformative time. I love you, each one, each one a precious light. I love you. God bless you. God bless you.
