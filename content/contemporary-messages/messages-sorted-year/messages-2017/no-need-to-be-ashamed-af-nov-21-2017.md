# No Need to Be Ashamed of who you are

November 21<sup>st</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C.

Â 

I am Rock Hudson. This is not my true name but this is my stage name. I have found great liberation in the world of spirit for I lived my life in secret. I was ashamed of my life, and how I was in this world - yours. But now I have come to know the Love of God and to know my soul and have come to see life very differently indeed. I wish to come with direct voice for many will recognize my face. I want to speak about how God loves every soul in this world and in my world no matter how they are in this world, what draws them and affects their thinking and being in this world. They are still loved by God.

There are many who carry the same burden as I did in this world. There is no need for this, or to be ashamed of oneself. What draws one to be different, these things are of no consequence to God for God sees within your soul. That is what is important - those desires and thoughts that are good and of love and care for others. So much needs to be shared with mankind. I too wish to share my story and how I have found redemption with the gift of the Father's Love.

God bless you, my friends. May you find great success in your ventures. May I find an opportunity to speak in this way. God bless you. God bless you.
