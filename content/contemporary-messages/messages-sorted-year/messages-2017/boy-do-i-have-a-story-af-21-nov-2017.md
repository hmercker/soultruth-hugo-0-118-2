# Boy do I have a story to tell!

November 21<sup>st</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C.

Received by A.F.

 

Hello, I am Marilyn Monroe. Boy, do I have a story to tell!  I would love to tell my story with direct voice. I think many will recognize who I am. I wish to not only bring the truth of my life but the Truth of God's beautiful blessings for all.

I hope that I will have an opportunity to speak along with many of my compatriots in this field of work that we all endeavored to bring some measure of happiness and light to humanity. Of course there are deeper matters now that need to be discussed and shared. We all have a deep desire to bring substantial Truth to mankind, to bring greater love to humanity. I truly hope that this opportunity may come to all of us and that mankind will indeed listen to our words and see us for who we truly are, our true selves in Light and beauty and Love.

God bless you, my friends. May His Love continue to touch your souls. May we all continue to grow in the Light, to be beautiful, truly beautiful in the glory of God. God bless you. God bless you and good night.
