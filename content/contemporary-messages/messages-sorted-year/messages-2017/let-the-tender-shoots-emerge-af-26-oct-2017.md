# Let the tender shoots of your soul emerge

I am Matthew. 

You are indeed reaching up towards God in your efforts, and yes, the Master Jesus did come to bless you, beloved souls. This is indicative of your efforts, your desires to draw the Master close, that he may bless you deeply and he did so. This is how it will go for you my friends, in increments, stepping up closer to the light, allowing your true selves to emerge as you work together, acknowledging your beautiful souls and working from that place of soul awareness and love. This is the power that is needed to manifest direct voice; the power of love, the power of your own soulful expressions of love, the recognition and acknowledgment of your true selves. Your souls are bringing forth the light within you and are allowing that light to manifest in beautiful ways amongst you. The pairing of this love and your true desire to work towards this goal so that you may open the floodgates of heaven to pour upon you, will continue to lift you up ever further, closer to our Heavenly Father. 

So, as you see, this is not so much of a technical exercise, as it is a soulful awakening. These technical questions and curiosities of details in order to understand the process of developing direct voice amongst you are not so important my friends, these details, this understanding. You have been told before that you are close to developing the gift of direct voice with lower spirits, ones that are below the fourth plane, but this is not our goal, is it? You wish to manifest the angels of heaven amongst you. This requires a very elevated condition amongst you. This can only be from the opening of your souls, allowing that beautiful, yet vulnerable and tender place within you to come to the fore, to be expressed, to find a sense of belonging and comfort, acceptance and love amongst you all for one another. For this to happen you must come to truly know yourselves, to be aware of those places within you that you are reluctant to express to one another. These places that are very sensitive, parts of yourselves that have been beaten down by this world. To acknowledge this and bring love and healing to these parts of yourselves is necessary. So each one of you must come to that place of deep sensitivity and vulnerability so that these tender parts of your soul may be infilled with God's Divine Love and may be healed and transformed; so that the tender shoots may spring forth and bloom. For, in these places of extreme vulnerability lie your deepest gifts, my beloveds. You have protected these parts of yourself for a long time and you are challenged to strip away this armour, to be naked before God, to look at your brothers and sisters and say: *"This is who I am, this is my story, this is my pain and I wish to let this go. I wish to be healed and brought above these conditions so that I might flourish in this Holy Love, this beautiful gift from God and be free of the shackles of my own fear, and hurt and pain."*

Beloved souls, you are on the verge of the awakening of your souls. This full awakening where your eyes are open, your hearts are full, your souls resplendent in this light and love, and in this place the development of such gifts as direct voice is readily available to you. It makes our work so much easier. You can imagine walking into a home where the windows and doors are shuttered - it is dark - and to navigate through this place requires a stealth that is difficult to obtain on this level of existence, but when the doors and windows are open to light and all is welcoming and joyful, it is not difficult to navigate, to be close to each one of you and to work with you in close rapport. 

So we urge you on in this journey of awakening. We urge you to redouble your efforts in prayer, going to your Heavenly Father, receiving His Love and going deep within yourselves so that you may receive this Love to the deepest places within your souls. You have been blessed my beloveds, blessed mightily. Every effort that can be made, has been made on your behalf. We who are in charge of your little circle work tirelessly for your benefit. Many are praying for you, both in this world and in ours. God's hand rests firmly upon each one of you beloved souls. Release yourself to this light, allow your souls to soar. Have faith that those vulnerable places within you will find deep peace and joy as you bring them to the light of God's Touch, His Love. This is what you truly yearn for my beloveds. This is what God desires to give to you. There is no holding back, no holding back, for now is the time to feel the rumblings of your soul, to know the inflowings of God, to accept joyfully the Gifts that He has to give you beloveds. Your minds are acquiescing, they do not hold sway upon you because you have detached yourselves from this world as much as you can and this has brought you many blessings, a great boon to your soul. 

Be in prayer beloved souls, be in prayer and know that God hears every word, every inkling of a desire, every effort, every intention goes to God at this time. Let this be a great outpouring from you so you may receive a great inflowing from God. God bless you beloved souls. I am Matthew and I continue to pray with you and work with you, as do all of your guides, helpers, teachers. So many surround you. You are truly blessed and truly loved. God bless you.
