Goldie comes in laughing, bringing great joy! Oh, my friends, I look forward to being able to sing and dance with you in direct voice!!

Despite my friend’s seriousness, we are all joyed with your entertaining the possibility of direct voice. What a beautiful gift this will be for the world. We are all joyed and we will continue to pray that you and we will come to that place of joining together and making these efforts to bring this to reality. And when this happens, I will indeed come and sing and dance and bring my words of joy to the world. God bless you, I am Goldie and I Love you. God bless you.
