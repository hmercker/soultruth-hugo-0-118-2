Â 

We all bask in this Light, do we not? This beautiful Light that [Mary](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2017/be-a-channel-carrying-love-af-21-nov-2017/) has brought and that God has given to each one. And so as you continue to forge ahead to make your commitments and your efforts, to pray and long for this Light and Love, so God continues to pour His blessings upon you, sending His beloved angels to watch over you, to bring great peace and joy and Love. For God does not limit His gifts to His children, He brings forth what He can to those who are willing to receive, to be open, to long for this. And this has put you in good stead, my beloved friends. You have felt the upliftment in the chamber. You have experienced much within that place, that is dark yet full of Light. 

And you know that God continues to prepare you for this work that comes, that comes on the heels of His blessings and desire to bring revelations to mankind. For He continues to uplift this world, to bring what is required that mankind may indeed come to a place of Truth and wisdom, Light and Love. And you have experienced for yourselves these blessings. You continue to walk in the forefront and to witness the blessings of God and what they do for each one of you; the tangible results of your prayers, the insights and understandings that come as your soul opens and these faculties that bloom in the Light, bringing Truth and knowledge, joy and wisdom. These insights will continue to blossom within you, your souls will continue to resonate at this high vibration of Light and Love. And in this, will come the gifts that are promised, in this the doors are open and the Light floods in.

And though you continue to go within the chamber seeking manifestations, correlations to your expectations, so that you may be comforted by your efforts, you may find confirmation of your desires and seek to know through this experience, the Truth of the matter. And I say to you my friends, revelations will come, confirmations will happen and manifest. But I warn you not to place within your mind too many expectations or ideas of what you must do and be within this chamber. It will flow in harmony my friends. It will flow in harmony. Do what you feel is right. Express what you know is good and in harmony with Love and do not be overly concerned with all the technical matters of this development, the development of this gift. Be at peace, be at peace and bring to the chamber your joy, your excitement, your sense of playfulness, your desire for peace. Bring these things into the chamber, seek the Love of God above all else and allow what comes to come. Allow yourselves to be absorbed by this Light, to be uplifted and a part of what is within this beautiful chamber of Light. 

Much more is coming my friends, much more, and I believe you will be pleased with the outcomes that will manifest. For we are pleased with the conditions within the chamber, this Light that has built steadily day by day, prayer by prayer, effort by effort. Do you not sense the progression of these efforts, of all our efforts together? It takes time, it is incremental, it requires patience and perseverance. And you are used to this my friends, as you have brought greater Light within yourselves through all of your efforts and consistency in prayer, so you understand how these laws work, how these things may come. It is the fervency of your desire and your prayers, your efforts in Love and harmony and this comes from your souls beloveds. Let your minds settle and be at peace. Allow your souls to move forward in your understandings and awareness. Have faith that you will reach your goal and this goal will be realized because you understand the power of Love and the power of your own creativity and the power of your choices and desires. God utilizes these aspects of every soul in order to bring greater Light to this world. Those who continue to express Light and do so in faith and fervent prayer, will be used by God to bring blessings to this world. 

Your time is well spent my friends and will bear fruit. May you continue to reach higher, to seek Love, to acknowledge your own experiences and your sense of the blessings that God has to give. God bless you beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. I continue to work with each one of you within the chamber and with every opportunity available to us, to uplift and to bring those conditions and aspects that are required to bring forth this gift. Much has been accomplished thus far and we will continue to forge ahead in Light and harmony, in Truth and Love. God bless you beloveds. My Love is with you.
