# Blessings a Hundred Fold to those Efforts You Have Made

We have gone on quite a journey together, have we not my friends? It has been a busy time, a time that has certainly kept us very busy. And we have accomplished much together. You have learned much, you have grown much and you have come closer to God rising up evermore day by day, moment by moment and prayer by prayer. You have exercised your faith and come to know God in greater measure. You have sought the Truth and you have found Truth. You have sought to unburden yourselves and you have found joy and Lightness. You have sought to find the will of God and to express it in your lives and thus you are together in this Light at this very moment.

Yes we continue to journey together, and it will take us to many places within your heart and within this world. The mighty hand of God’s Will carries you beyond the mundane, to something extraordinary and powerful and meaningful and purposeful. You will know the glory and power of God in your lives and see that every effort you have made, every prayer that you have said, every time you have reached for greater Light will bring to you blessings a hundred fold to those efforts you have made.

God is with you my friends. God bless you and my Love is with you. God bless you.
