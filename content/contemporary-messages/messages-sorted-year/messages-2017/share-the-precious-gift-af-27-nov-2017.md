I come, I am Jesus. I come because you form a great Light in this place, and the desires of your souls bring the response from Heaven and God's Touch upon each one of you, beloved souls, each one a Light, each one beautiful and loved by God. You carry a Light, beloved souls, and you carry a desire that this world may be touched by Light, that those in this world may know peace and may feel within them your Love, the Love of God.

The power of God's Blessings will change the world,and bring the awakening that is required that this world may find peace and balance and harmony. You must continue, beloved souls, to seek the Love of the Father, to seek this gift, for with each soul that carries this Light within them God may use them to ignite more Light within this world. You each carry something precious. You each know the Truth within your souls. May you carry this Truth wherever you go. May the Light within your souls flood forth, bringing peace and comfort, Love and joy to your brothers and sisters.

Drink deep these loving living waters, drink deep, for at this moment a great flood of Love washes over you. Drink deep, my beloveds, and know that God wishes to touch your souls deeply, to open your hearts, to bring you many gifts and Truths and knowledge.

I am with you my brothers and my sisters. I walk with you because you carry the precious gift that must be shared with all. God bless you and keep you in this great Light.
