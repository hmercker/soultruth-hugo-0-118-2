God bless you beloved souls. I am your friend Alec. Yes, I have not spoken in a while. That does not mean that I have been away. I have been with you, very often, observing your efforts, your discussions, your attempts to be in greater harmony and to prepare yourselves for Direct Voice.

You speculate upon the timing of these messages and your efforts. I say this is God's timing. For the conditions of the world will accelerate and you all feel this. You have spoken that the sense of timing of your lives has been disrupted. This is true, for God is accelerating the energetic conditions of this world and you are feeling the consequences. This is all part of His plan, manifestations of His Will and energies upon this planet changing conditions, accelerating certain energies and influences upon this planet. 

Thus you feel a sense of urgency. This is not unfounded, for now is the time for you to put aside any reticence, to walk and listen. You are in harmony and in tempo with God's Will.

This dear daughter speaks of allowing God's Will to guide her life. This is a wise choice for as you are able to allow the influence, the whispers, the Will of God to enter your consciousness you will know what you are meant to do. Each day is a challenge that you may be in harmony with this flow of God's Will. But with each day you inch yourselves ever forward to become in alignment with God. Thus the desire of your soul is this – to seek God in all things, to be in harmony with His Will and that that harmony must be conscious and expressed in everything you do. The human condition often compels you to ignore this inner voice but you continue to bring yourself back into alignment and to listen. In time hearing and expressing the Will of God will become second nature and all will flow as it should.

When you have those times when you feel you are not being productive, that little is happening in your life, I say this is untrue, that much is happening but you have shut yourself off from the awareness of it. For God uses you on many different levels. There are many works that you accomplish that your conscious material mind is unaware of. Yet this does happen. It is real, but it is not material in the way that you see the material. So have faith my friends, that much is happening in your life because you have made this choice to serve God. You continue to desire to bring this Love forth in the world as His channels and God continues to utilize your gifts in many different ways. So do not judge yourself harshly, my friends, there is much that has been accomplished and much that will be. As you move along on this path more and more will become a conscious effort and less will be a mystery.

Yet as you continue to grow in your love and your faith, I would encourage you to put aside your doubts and your self-recriminations and your feelings of unworthiness and all those human conditions that beset humanity and to be in the world but not of the world. For you are of something else that grows within you, the remaking of your being from mortal to angelic. This is a magnificent evolutionary step that starts with your soul and infills and influences every part of you. Isn't it magnificent how God's gifts unfold in this wondrous kaleidoscope, expressing who you are in such beautiful patterns, such beautiful ways, exquisite, delicate yet powerful. Such as you are, beloved souls, beautiful flowers opening one petal at a time, facing the sun of God's great Soul. Such beauty, such beauty.

God bless you, my friends. May you continue in your service, your desires, your prayers, your spiritual life for the world needs more like you, beloved souls, the world needs more. God bless you. I am your friend Alec and I do love you and am with you. God bless you.
