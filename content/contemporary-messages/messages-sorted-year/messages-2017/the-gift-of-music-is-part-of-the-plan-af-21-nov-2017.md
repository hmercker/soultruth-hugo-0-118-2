# The Gift Of Music Shall Be A Part Of This Plan

November 21<sup>st</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C.

Received by A.F.

Â 

I am Ludwig Von Beethoven. I too wish to express the music of my heart and soul. And you will be surprised how God has changed me, how my music has changed and been refined by the Light that I carry within me and the station of my life in the world of spirit, so beyond what is in this world, so beyond it, and so beautiful. 

And so we wish to bring these gifts down to your earth, down to this place so in need of Light and beauty. The gift of music shall be a part of this plan to uplift humanity and I will do my part if I am able to come in this way. God bless you beloved souls. God bless you.
