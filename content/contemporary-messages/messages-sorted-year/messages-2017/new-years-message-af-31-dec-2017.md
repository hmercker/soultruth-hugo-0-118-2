God bless you, beloved souls, may the Holy Spirit touch your souls deeply. I am Samuel and I have come because you have called me with your prayers. God has sent me to touch your souls, beloveds, to touch your souls that you may open and flower in the blessings of the Father's Love.

I have come to tell you that the year ahead will be like a year none other in your lives. God has much work for you to do and many new souls to meet, many efforts on God's behalf to bring forth for the benefit of others and for the benefit of your own souls. A great wave of Love and change, blessings and upheavals is coming to this world and continues to flow into your world. This will inspire you to walk amongst mankind with Love and wisdom, to pray with your brothers and sisters, to speak of this Truth of Love and to walk in this Light which envelopes you all.

His Touch is upon you and His Love flows into your soul at this very moment. You are richly blessed, beloveds. God shall guide you forth and shall open doors and make possible your efforts to comfort many with Truth, to walk with many in Love, to be His channel of Love in this world. Do not concern yourselves with what is to come, merely live your days in the flow of God's Love, in His Light and blessings, with joyful appreciation of your life and the blessings that God has given you and shall continue to pour upon you in greater blessings and strength and Light.

Each day a new door will open for you, my beloveds. In the days to come many doors will open that will surprise you and events will take place quickly. You must be ready, beloved souls, you must be ready to carry this Light forth in the world, to listen to God's calls, to be in harmony with the Will of God and with one another as you work together - you and others - in this great work for the salvation of mankind. For this is the work you are engaged in. This is what God has purposefully guided you to do, to be His channels of Love and Truth, to work in that great flow to bring peace and Love and harmony to this world so in need of Light.

God bless you, beloved souls. Carry the faith within you. Walk in this Light. Trust in the Will of God and the timing of God for all will unfold in perfect timing, its sequence of events orchestrated by God with great purpose and deliberation. This will bring the blessings that are required, the changes that are coming, the comfort that is needed, and the Truth that is to be given to those souls eager to know. You each carry a great purpose. You must accept and walk with this purpose in great faith and strength and Love. 

God bless you, my beloved, beloved friends. I am Samuel and I bring my love to you. Many angels surround you as you mark the beginning of another year. This will be a year like none other, full of many blessings and opportunities opening doors. You will work close with the angels. God bless you, beloveds, and keep you in His Love always. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
