May the Grace of God, which is His Love, envelop and bless you within your souls, beloveds. I am Matthew. I have come to extrapolate upon the reading that you have been speaking of. I have come to speak about the feelings of the soul. For the minds of man find it difficult to speak of feelings, suggesting that a mind cannot feel, it perceives a Truth. This is untrue when it comes to the understandings of the soul, for a soul feels its understanding, its comprehension of a Truth. For when a soul understands a Truth, all aspects of that soul are engaged. Thus comes a feeling, with a perception, an awareness, an openness to a Truth from God.

Can the intellect describe Love? No, one must feel Love to understand it. This, my beloveds, is why you continue to pray and long for this Love, to experience it on all these different levels of awareness, to engage your emotional self, to engage your material mind, to engage the perceptions of your soul. To know this Truth of Love is to experience and feel it to the very depths of your being. 

It is important to teach this my beloveds, to share in this experience together in prayer, to speak of your feelings, to speak of your perceptions, to speak of the experience of receiving God’s great Love. In this way as each soul experiences the inflowing of the Father’s Blessing of Love, experiences unique for each one, the experience is deep and intimate. One cannot say *“oh, you have received the Father’s Love because you have experienced this or that.”* No, my beloveds, the experience is unique for each soul. Although there are many commonalities in experience, there is a wide range as this inflowing takes place within the soul. Indeed, many of you have shared your unique experience, have talked of what took place when God touched your soul. 

This is beautiful and a powerful testimony to the Truth. But do not get caught up in a form of dogma that says *“oh if you experienced this, then you have received the Blessing of the Father’s Love.”* No, my beloveds, it is unique for each individual. Be accepting and embrace this uniqueness of experience; allow and validate the experience of each individual in prayer. There is no formula for this. There is no standard. There are no words that can truly express the wonderment of this deep Touch from the Heavenly Father. I will say that often in this Touch comes joy, comes upliftment, comes an opening and expansion within. But those feelings that one experiences cannot be truly described, only felt and acknowledged by each individual as it happens, the event of this Touch from God.

May you continue to be open and receptive to this Blessing from God, to know His Love and that unique experience within your soul, to be sensitive and aware of the deep feelings that come from your souls and that unique and intuitive understanding as God touches you in this way. Be open to the experiences of others. Accept their words even if they do not match your own. Be loving. Embrace and encourage each individual to find their way to God and to be open to this great blessing. It is so simple, my beloveds, the feeling that comes with Love, that dawning awareness that you are loved, that dawning awareness that God is Love, is all that is required. A thousand words, a million books will never truly bring this Truth as it is experienced by that deep Touch from God.

May you continue to share in this, this holy communion. May this precious group continue to bring the Light of God’s Love in its midst and be a channel of Love for this world and acknowledge the power of God’s Touch as it influences and infiltrates every part of your being and your life. For it continues to make the changes and bring that deep joy, that wonderment, as your eyes open, your soul awakens to the Truth of God, the Truth and Power of His Love.

God bless you, beloveds. God bless you in this great and wondrous experience of soul awakening in Love. I love you, my beloveds. I am Matthew. I love you. God bless you. God bless you.
