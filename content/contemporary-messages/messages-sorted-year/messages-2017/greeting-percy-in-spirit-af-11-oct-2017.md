I am Jesus. I came to greet one of my beloved disciples today as he entered into the realms of spirit, joyful and beloved. I greeted him as he transitioned from the flesh. I embraced him, for I have and all the angels have, a deep gratitude for his efforts in this world. He is a beloved soul, one with a deep desire to bring the Truth of the Father's Love to this world. 

In his efforts, he brought much Light and Truth and he shall be amply rewarded as he progresses through the spheres of spirit to the Celestial Kingdom. It will not be long my beloveds, for him to join us in that exalted place filled with joy and love. It will not be long. I am happy to see within your hearts a sense of joy for his passing for this was his true desire, to come into the Light, to be free of the burdens of the flesh. He has indeed come to that place of freedom, a joyful soul indeed, a beautiful Light. We are blessed to receive him and you were blessed to have him in this world. 

Each one of you will someday enter that threshold and come to acknowledge the efforts that you have made in this life, to bring Light and Truth. Each of you have walked a unique path and have expressed your unique souls and come to serve God in beautiful ways, and as such, when your time comes you will enter into Light. You will explore the beauty and freedom and the love that comes in those spheres of spirit that are filled with these blessings.

So, your beloved father and friend, God's beloved servant has come home and found the Light of God that pours forth towards His Children, towards all children who are open and desirous of this blessing that comes, that comes to you all at this moment. It is with you, touching your souls, uplifting you and flowing into your souls. Feel the splendor and the beauty and the wonderment of the blessing of the Father's Love. This magnificent gift that is available to all who ask and desire and make effort to commune with God, so His Love pours forth. Your beloved Percy was filled with this Love, emanated this Light and knew so very well and clearly the wonderment of God's Touch within his soul. May you all feel the joy of this, the wonderment and the power of God's Love and how for each one of you, there comes a joy and a knowing and a surety that you are truly a child of God. We will continue to uphold you beloved souls, to help you to discover more light, deeper love, truth and joy. Blessings to you beloveds, blessings of Light, blessings from God.

I am Augustine and I come to be with you, with the Master, to bless you. God bless you. I am with you and I have been with your beloved father all of his life. I too greeted him as he passed into our realms of Light.

I am Phyllis and I am so overjoyed that my beloved Percy has joined me in the realms of Light. He has felt overwhelmed with joy and excitement and love. His passing was magnificent and beautiful. Many angels greeted him and thanked him for his service. He will continue to progress, for his soul is well on its way to at-onement with God. Such joy he gives to me, such joy to be with my beloved Percy, to embrace once more, to look at each other with eyes of Love. I am so happy and he is so happy. If you shed a tear, let it be a tear of joy for this is truly a joyous event, a joyous blessing. God bless you all. I am Phyllis and I love you all. God bless you. God bless you.
