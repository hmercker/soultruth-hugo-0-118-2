# The Gifts and Purpose of each Soul

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Samuel. I have come to speak upon an important subject, the importance of knowing the purpose that God has infused within your souls. The primary reason for a soul to incarnate into the world is to establish identity to that soul, an individuality that comes with experience of the material world and donning material flesh. This purpose each soul has as they incarnate.

Yet God gives another purpose to each soul, a purpose that involves service, of expressing a particular gift in this world. For every soul is imbued with a particular gift. Though there may be many gifts of the soul, one particular gift which can be expressed in one's life fulfils a specific desire by God that you express your purpose in this way. Each of you, beloved souls, are beginning to awaken to your purpose, to understand what you are meant to do in this world, understand those particular gifts within your soul that are yearning to come to the fore and fulfil the Will of God. These gifts always are expressed for the benefit of others. Thus one might desire to express these gifts accordingly.

Yet within each soul is a purpose in this respect, yet very few souls come to understand this. With the inflowing of Divine Love, the awakening of this purpose is inevitable as you grow in this Love and your soul's awareness becomes your awareness. Thus the importance of this expression, this gift, comes to the fore.

Each of you have had a sense all of your lives that you had something to do in this world that is important. Thus God has gathered you together so that you may support one another in these expressions, these beautiful gifts that are to flow forth to humanity. Within this is the fulfilment of God's Plan. In this is the fulfilment of your own soul's desire to serve God. As these purposeful gifts unfold within you, what is meant to be becomes clear and sure and the expression neither complicated nor convoluted. There is a clear expression, something that comes as second nature to you. For this is the nature of gifts, is it not, that there is a talent, an ability, something within you that flows readily? This gift is like water springing forth from your soul, the waters of Truth, of Light, the waters that touch others. They feel this touch. They know there is something that is beautiful and of God.

Thus that part of you that God has imbued within your souls will come forth and touch many souls. For some, the expression of their purpose is obvious and undeniable within your minds while with others this purpose is more subtle and gentle. As you live your life, so this purpose unfolds and is expressed in ways that you may often not be aware. But it is still a natural function of your unique soul. As your soul is awakened in Divine Love, it enhances these gifts, it brings a powerful expression. As your souls awaken and become more aware, the awareness of these gifts and purpose become stronger and clearer.

So I say this to you my beloved souls, because you come close to these unique gifts and purpose in your life, God has a plan for each one of you. God will show you the way. You are drawn together because you recognize that there is something in common here in terms of what you have to give to the world and how this complements one another. These expressions are resonant, they come together in a beautiful circle of Light, a beautiful expression that makes the circle whole and brings the channel of Light intensely through you from God.

There is much work for each one of you to bring Light into this world, to assist others to come to know their true selves, their souls, to come to know God and His Love. You do so in your unique ways, with your unique gifts and as you express these gifts together there is a great harmony that ensues, a natural affiliation and an affection that grows. As you continue in this work and seek the true expressions of your souls and come to understand the Will of God, you will be led to many other souls who will join with you with their special gifts, creating a wondrous resource for this world, a resource to bring greater Light, to bring change and healing to this world. This also is God's Plan.

So much is coming, my beloved souls, as you continue to progress into the future. Greater awakenings, deeper understandings of yourself and your purpose will unfold. This will bring joy, a deep sense of fulfilment, a deep understanding of the beauty that is your own soul and the gifts that God has put within you. I would suggest, beloved souls, it is time to put aside any obstruction that may inhibit the flowering of your collective efforts to express Love and harmony together, to acknowledge that each one is unique. This is beautiful. There is a place for each to serve together for the benefit of humanity. For it is the Love within your souls that brings the power of this Light that will guide you forth as God continues to bring His Guidance and Inspiration and loving Touch upon you. Do you see how this all works together, beloved souls? How what you have to give benefits your brothers and sisters and what they have to give benefits yourself. As you acknowledge the beauty of each other you acknowledge the beauty of God's Creation. The more powerful are your feelings of Love and acknowledgement, the more effective you will be as channels of Love and Light in this world.
 
Continue to pray together, beloved souls, to work together, to acknowledge the inspiration that God has to give each one and how this works for the whole and brings harmony and purpose, so there is no doubting or confusion, merely the joyous acknowledgement of the work that is to be done. So much work to be done, for this world needs precious Lights such as yourselves, powerful examples of Love and harmony. As you stand together in loving harmony with those who are also part of your circle, you make a powerful statement to the world that the power of Love is greater than anything else, the power of Love is what will heal this world, the power of Love is what must be acknowledged by humanity, and this Truth needs to be lived by. For without the component of Love, this world is a dreary place and all the wondrous potentials that God has imbued into this world and within each soul in this world is often lost because Love does not ignite these potentials.

How important it is for you, beloved souls, to recognize the gift of Love within your soul from God and to express that in everything that you do, everything that you are. So much can be accomplished when it is predicated upon Love, the Love of the Heavenly Father, the Love that comes through prayer, through the holy touch of the Holy Spirit. This is the Love that will change the world, for this is the Love that will change each soul who desires it, this wondrous blessing, and who expresses this in their lives and discovers through this experience and communion with God that great purpose that God has imbued within your souls.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Samuel and I am glad to speak to you. I love you. I continue to monitor your progress and to assist you when I can in this great journey of soul awakening. I am with you. I am with you. God bless you, beloveds.
