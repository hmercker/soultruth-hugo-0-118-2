Â 

It is Goldie, I too am with you. I hope you can feel my joy and the joy of all the beautiful angels who work with you and see your lights glowing, growing, coming closer to God. Such joy this brings to me and to many, such joy. You feel it too, do you not - the joy in your hearts, the beauty of your souls coming alive, coming to know God? May you continue, beloved souls, to feel the joy in your hearts, to be in that wondrous Light, in the flow of His Wondrous Love.

I am with you, and joyfully so. God bless you, beloveds. Good night. God bless you.
