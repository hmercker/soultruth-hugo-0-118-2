Â 

I am (Dame Nellie) Melba. I was a singer of note on the stage many years ago. I wish to sing to humanity, to sing God's praises, to sing with clarity and beauty that may uplift the souls of mankind. My gifts have only grown since coming to this side of life. My soul has grown as well in the Love of God. Those who will hear me, will hear and feel the sincerity of my soul, the beauty that comes from my beautiful soul so that God may reveal Light through me. It is my wish that God may use my gifts to bring revelations to mankind, to your world. I will sing from my heart that is filled with the Light of God and the Love of God.

May your ventures be successful, my friends. Many from my side of life have a keen interest in what you are doing. So much hinges upon your success, your efforts, for humanity is ripe for greater Truth. May you find that way to bring these Truths forth for God's Hand is truly upon you  my friends. It is obvious by the light that you carry that God has blessed you, blessed you deeply. May His Love always find lodging within your souls and may those gifts that you carry be expressed in your world. The world needs you, my friends, the world needs you. God bless you. Thank you. God bless you.
