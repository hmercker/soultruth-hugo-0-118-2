Â 

I am Confucius. God pours a great wave of healing upon you, my beloveds. A wave of many colors, deep and resonating and beautiful to help you with your physical bodies, to help you with your spirit bodies, to help you to be in greater alignment and harmony with your souls. This is so that you may be prepared for the work that comes and the opportunities that will arise from your gifts unfolding and coming to fruition.

Much will be expected of you, my beloved souls. There will be many demands upon you as the world, the lost souls, come to you for comfort and Truth and Love. Thus you must be strong and in alignment with God so that the intensity of these conditions of the world will not pull you down into this darkness but God will keep you elevated in Love and Light. We promise you, my beloved souls, that the darkness will not pull you away from the Light. You will be protected and carried, for you are within the flow of God's Plan and Will for you, my beloveds. There is nothing to fear. There is a great adventure ahead. You will find and receive great fulfillment in this work.

May the gracious Heavenly Father continue to touch you deeply. As He carries you forth, may you continue to hear His whispers within and know His Will that brings you to clarity, to strength and joyous harmony. God bless you, my beloveds. I am Confucius and I have been close to you, beloveds. I speak with each one of you when you are asleep and counsel you so. God bless you. God bless you.
