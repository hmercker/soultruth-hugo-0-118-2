May God bless you, I am Martha. I too have watched the miracles of your souls growing in Light and Love. I too have had the privilege of serving you, praying for you, counselling you at times. And my beloved, beloved daughter, how you have grown, how you have released difficulties and those feelings that were so strong in you, that did you no good. God has healed you beloved. God has given you a gift, as He has for all His beautiful souls in this circle - a new start, a fresh start. Keep your Light bright, feel the joy, the wonderment of God’s gift of Light to you and all the beautiful things within you that shine forth. May they all be expressed in His Love. I will continue to be with you my friends. I will be there when you need me. I will be there when I think you need me. And I will be there because I Love you. God bless you beloved, beloved souls.
