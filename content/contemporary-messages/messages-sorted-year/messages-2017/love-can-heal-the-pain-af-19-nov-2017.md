Hello, I am Sigmund Freud. Oh how wrong I was in my estimations of humanity. How I tried to dissect the human personalities. Yes, some benefits came from my research and discoveries, but in many ways I did more harm than good. I regret many things. But now I wish to correct these errors. If I have a place within your work, I will work diligently to help bring greater Light to humanity, to enlighten your brothers and sisters. 

I did not believe in God when I walked in this plane, instead I believed in my own power and capacity to deduce truth. This became a great stumbling block to my soul, for my mind ruled supreme. My understanding was all intellectual and theoretical. Now that I see, now that my eyes begin to open to the Truth that God has to give to each and every soul, I am humbled. I understand now that Love is the key to healing all that ails the human psyche. Love is the key. Accept and care, embracing your brothers and sisters with Love. This is the key that will heal so much within the troubled mind. For every mind and every soul seeks connection with Love, to be a part of humanity, to feel the comfort of a mother's love, to know the brotherhood and sisterhood of mankind. Teach love, my friends. It is the way, it is the way - the only way truly to bringing humanity to a place of peace and prosperity. For so much can be accomplished when all of these roadblocks, all of this emotional pain and confusion is put aside and healed. It is the power of God's Love that can do this.

Each soul has the capacity to understand what it is that holds them back from God. This is where you may assist others and to assist each other to use the faculties of the soul, the perceptions of your soul to understand yourself, to understand humanity, to see in this deep way what lies within each soul and what struggles each individual has in this world. You have this capacity to perceive, to truly know from the soul perceptions. But first you must open yourself to God, to truly understand God, to truly be released from your own pain in this way, this way of capitulating from all the defenses and barriers that every human being creates to feel safe and to not be hurt by others. Recognizing this vulnerability is important when one goes to God with deep sincerity, deep prayer, recognizing within yourself what is truly there. 

Without this integrity and honesty, one can only go so far in the development of your soul. It requires this deep honesty and turning your face to God and saying "God, my Father, I need you. I need Your care and Love. I need to be healed. I need to be free from my pain." In this simple request coupled with your prayers for the Father's Love will come all that you require to be free and in the Light.

May God bless you, my friends. I am Sigmund Freud and I too stand by you in these magnificent efforts to bring greater Truth to humanity. May this Truth come forward in ways that humanity can accept and absorb, to know and to live by. It is a great work, a great work indeed. God bless you. God bless you, my friends.
