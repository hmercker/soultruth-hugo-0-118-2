Â 

God bless you, I am Seretta Kem. You are bathing in the living waters of God at this moment. These waters flood into this room, into your circle, nourishing you, beloved souls, and uplifting you and bringing the great blessing to your soul of His Love that you may expand in this Light and that each of you expands with this Love, your souls touch one another making a beautiful circle of light.

Thus we will uplift you, my friends, as you continue to pray for the gift of direct voice. We will come ever closer to you as you continue to release those conditions that would hold us from you and hold you from one another and hold you from God. It is in this melding of all these aspects and elements that will bring about the manifestations that you seek. Thus you must yearn more intensely, open more fully, desire with all your heart and soul to be close, closely in this Light, in this beautiful Light that we may all bathe together in these living waters poured upon us by the great Holy Spirit, God's manifestation of Love.

Drink deep, my beloveds, for you begin anew, you begin anew. God has wiped your brows, has put His Hand upon you and uplifts you. The tears have dried up, the worries are gone. It is time now to joyously walk forward immersed in this Love. Like a baptism, you are blessed in Love and raised above the earthly conditions ever closer to God. You awaken, you breathe in His Love, your eyes open and as the scales are peeled away and the Truth comes in great waves in beautiful awakenings and revelations, His Love infusing every part of you and causing the changes that are necessary to bring this gift to fruition. Allow God into you, my beloveds. Do not hold back but welcome the Touch of God as His holy gift pours into you at this very moment. You are being consecrated in Love. Feel this outpouring. Reach out in your true longings of the soul and pull to you the mighty rushing waters that will give to you all that you require at this moment to be close to God.

We will begin on the morrow, my beloveds. You are being prepared at this moment. God bless you. Seretta Kem loves you, my beautiful, beautiful friends. You are loved and touched deeply by God. God bless you.
