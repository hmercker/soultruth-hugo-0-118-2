You have committed themselves to this work. I will be with you for the entire time that you are together. Each of us has a function within the circle as do you in accordance to our gifts. So we will play our roles, provide our service, give the utmost of what we have to give.

My role is to maintain the condition of Light around you and around us. I act as a sort of gatekeeper. I will observe each moment as you are together. Not only within the chamber but each moment you are together I will be with you. I will ensure that you are protected and upheld in Light. This is my commitment to you, my beloveds. It is an honor to be able to serve in this way. 

May God bless you mightily, my friends, to bring a powerful reformation to this world, a new dawn, a new understanding, to lift up humanity from their blindness, their ignorance, their pain, to ignite within them a desire within their souls to seek God, to seek Truth and to seek Love. Though God ultimately ignites the soul, you must think of ourselves as the ones who will point the way. Pointing the way so that many may see clearly where they must put their attentions, their focus to come to know their own souls, to come to know their true selves and to come to see that the most powerful energies of the universe come with Love and are expressed in Love. 
So we will journey together. I hope that some of you at least will come to know me well and recognize my presence with you. I give you my love. What a blessing that we are together in this way for God has blessed us mightily has He not, and given us a tremendous opportunity. May we fulfill His Will and find our way along this path in service, be successful in our ventures. I say to you, God bless you. We will be together. I am with you. I am Martin Luther and I love you.
