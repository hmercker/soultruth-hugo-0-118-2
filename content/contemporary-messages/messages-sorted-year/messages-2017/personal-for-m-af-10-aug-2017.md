God bless you. I am Lotus Blossom and I am happy to be able to speak through this instrument. I’ve been with you often, my daughter; I’ve heard your queries and your questions. I’ve seen you use the Truths that you know to bring greater knowledge, health, vibrancy and joy to you and to others.

You are indeed a practitioner of the spirit body, my beloved. For much of what you do requires that your spirit body be in harmony with the flows of energies so that the light and aura of your being is pure, beautiful and vital. You and I have had many conversations to that effect while you are in your sleep state. You are very busy when you are sleeping, my daughter. 

So when you feel you lack a vocation, please remember that you are working on many different levels in this world and you are helping many different spirits and mortals as you do this work. And as you do this work you are also learning and growing and developing. This work will become more conscious and overt in this world. Pieces of the puzzle will begin to come together so that you will see this bigger picture and you will see your purpose to explain, to teach and to demonstrate these Truths in beautiful, practical and beneficial ways in this world. You are in training, though you are indeed a practitioner, you are also integrating many levels of Truth into a way in which you may teach this in harmony and without error. And I help you with this as do others who have a deep interest in your spiritual development and growing of your awareness and the growing of your soul in Love.

So my beloved sister, continue upon your journey unencumbered by feelings that you are not performing in the way that others expect. This is a fallacy and is untrue for the expectations are merely your own projections upon others. And do you not know that God has a plan for you, beloved? Do you not realize that you are indeed upon the path that you are meant to walk and you continue to express yourself in beautiful ways and this will evolve and change as you continue to grow in your soul and in your conscious awareness of Truth. You will indeed become a very powerful channel, my beloved. One with deep knowledge and understanding of the ways of the human spirit, the ways of the functioning of the body in relationship to that spirit and in the ways of the soul. For do we not need practitioners of these Truths in the world? To bring them forth in simple and understandable language, to show and demonstrate these Truths in ways that others will understand and adopt because they clearly see the benefits.

You see the world is changing. The conditions of this world are changing and God wishes to uplift His children. God wishes that all His children may come to understand these basic Truths and principles of life, and you will bring some of that understanding to the world. You must see yourself as one who is being prepared, taught and as you experience your daily life, there are many opportunities to learn, to grow and you are receiving many inspirations, teachings within your meditations, your prayers and this shall continue. And as I have said, within your sleep state many more conversations, teachings and awarenesses are growing within you and they will bubble up into your awareness, your conscious awareness. And through your practice you are realizing the benefits of what you are doing for your body and your spirit, with your prayers answering the needs of your soul.  And so you are seeking harmony, beloved daughter, and harmony will come it is very close.  A deep joy is welling up within you, a deep sense of purpose, a deep understanding that God is with you.  How many in this world are craving such blessings?  And how many are you willing to teach the way towards these gifts and blessings, this way of being which brings such happiness and harmony.

And so it is for each one of you carrying your gifts, your particular role in this great upliftment of mankind. You are discovering the possibilities, understanding some of your limitations and realizing what it is that you must do to bring harmony within yourselves and your lives so that God may utilize you fully so the impact that you may have as His channels and instruments in this world may be great, that you will walk in light and harmony, in Love and joy. And those things of the earthily conditions that have beset you in the past and have caused you great angst may fall away, that you may be liberated from the human condition and fully indoctrinated into the Truth and Light of God’s great reality. All of this is because you chose to receive His Love, to walk the Path Divine, to seek the Truth, to know your Heavenly Father. That simple choice has opened the floodgates and these waters will carry you swiftly to many experiences and to many souls who await your touch, your voice of Truth, your embrace, the reflection of Love through your gaze upon them, the light that you carry. 

So beloved souls, your friend and teacher, Lotus Blossom will continue to support and bring my love to you and the beautiful flow and unfolding of your lives. God bless you, God bless you beloveds, I am with you. I love you and I see your lights, I see your true selves and they are beautiful, pearls beyond price. 

Light – bright – shining forth. Love – pure – bringing warmth and comfort to this world. Truth – clear – bringing a way through the dilemmas of this world. Strength – powerful – bringing a way forward for you to enact your purpose in this world. Grace – beautiful – so that you may flow with ease through the conditions of this world. Peace – deep – so that those conditions may not hamper you as you act in love. 

God is with you beloveds, God is with you. Seek Him with every breath, be with Him with every step, acknowledge Him with every thought and pay tribute to Him by loving yourselves and all in this world. God bless you, Lotus Blossom loves you, Lotus Blossom loves you indeed. God bless you.
