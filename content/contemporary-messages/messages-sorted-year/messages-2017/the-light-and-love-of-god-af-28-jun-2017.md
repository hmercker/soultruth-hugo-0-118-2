I am Peter. God’s Love surrounds you at this time. I urge you to drink it deep within. Open yourselves to this great blessing, this Touch. It comes with peace and grace, healing and comfort, Light and Truth. This is what you all seek my beloveds. You seek for this nurturance from God. You seek to soothe your souls, to be in this Light, to be awakened to the glory of God.

My beloveds, you are touched by God because your souls long and you pray for this inflowing, this great gift of Light. Release all that which holds you from this Light. Be with God. Be in His Love. Walk in this Light. Breathe in this Light. Allow this Light to permeate every part of you as it flows into your souls and heals all that which is within that is not in harmony with Love. It will also heal your body, your spirit. It will give you peace. It will strengthen you. It will bring a sense of connection and peace.

You sit in a sacred circle, beloveds. Continue to add your prayers to this beautiful place. For all those who come within this, rest assured, all who are here in spirit, all will be blessed in this sacred place of peace and Love. Bless your families and loved ones with your prayers. Bless all you know who are in need. For as this Light is present amongst you, it may flow out to others, to many places in the world, to many peoples, many who are connected to each one, many who are in need.

You sit in a sacred circle of Light. Be a channel of Love. Be prayerful. Be open to what God has to give to you at this very moment and allow all of God’s Blessings to flow forth to you, beloveds. Much is available to you, a great bounty of spiritual blessings. It is for you to ask, to be open, to accept and to bring this within and allow it to wrought the changes that will come with this Gift.

Blessings to you beloveds. I am Peter and I come to be with you in prayer. God bless you and keep you always in this Light, this blessed Light from God. God bless you.
