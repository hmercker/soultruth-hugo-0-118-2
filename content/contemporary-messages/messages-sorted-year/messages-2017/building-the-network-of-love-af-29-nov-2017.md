Â 

May the Father's Love find a constant inflowing into your souls my beloveds. May His Light shine upon you always. Wherever you are in this world may you know the Touch of God accompany you and comfort you and envelop you.

As you forge these bonds amongst you and gather the souls together and pray with all of the souls that come and sit around your circles of Light and share in these prayerful times, you build a bridge. A bridge, my beloveds, between each soul and yourselves and each soul and each other. So that in this world a bond of Light is created that will bring a source of strength and comfort amongst the children who are in prayer and share their love with one another, creating refuge in the world, creating a source of Light that will sustain you all for the power of your prayers together is mighty indeed. The power of Love to create peace and comfort, healing and joy. For God uses each of His beautiful souls who are receptive to be a channel of Love and blessings to all. So as you continue to pray with many souls and reach out ever further in this world,  you create with Love a wonderful network of souls in the Light.

You have prayed to God to be a channel of His Love and Light in the world. So this blessing shall flow forth through you to many. In this you also receive, my beloveds, you also benefit from the blessings of God. All the many bonds of Love, all the many bridges of Light will allow many blessings to circulate in this world, flowing forth one to another, coming from God to each soul, flowing from each soul to other souls.

It will be like this, beloved souls, as the conditions of this world continue to change and shift, what will remain steadfast will be this connection between yourselves and God and between yourselves and one another, a deep connection, a deep support and Love. You must give your heart to one another in love, to trust one another, to love one another building these bonds ever stronger, uplifting each other as you continue to grow within your souls and expand this Light as God infills you with His Holy Blessings of Love.

God cares for you in many different ways, my beloveds. This is one way that God cares for you through His instruments, those who are willing to live in the flow of His Love. This beautiful family will grow and expand and grow some more. Many will be connected, beloved souls. This is part of God's plan for the salvation of mankind. It will move from soul to soul, heart to heart until this great lattice of Love and Light, this wondrous bridge and connection between each soul shall cover the world.

Do not turn away those who seek to be connected to you in this way. Continue to open your hearts mightily for you have the capacity to gather many and to build this bridge with many. It is not difficult. It is a joy. This opening brings great and deep fulfillment within you as you gather your brothers and sisters around you. For many will be drawn, beloved souls. You must ask God to bless each one in Love. You must be sincere and open in this asking. God will use you to bring a blessing to touch in Love and comfort those who are eager yet lost in their souls. The Truth comes in this way, beloved souls. The Truth comes with a touch, a gaze of love, an embrace, a nod, a touch. In many ways God uses you and you feel the flow of His Love through you. Let this continue and intensify. May you be open and filled with such a sense of love for each and every soul in this world that this be the predominant awareness of your being, that you may feel love for every child in this world. This is truly being a channel for God's Love, a channel that is clear and broad and beautiful.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am John and my love is with you. We are bonded in this great journey to at-onement with God. God bless you and keep you always. God bless you.
