Each of you have felt a shift within your soul, a quickening, an opening and further understanding of your true soul’s desires. I would urge each one of you to pursue this beginnings of an awakening, to open further to God, to open further to your soul and to understand that this process, this quickening will go on for all eternity. The soul’s capacity for awakening and gathering Love and Light, of understanding the universe, of knowing God is infinite given an adequate amount of the blessing of Divine Love, the Essence of God.  As this accumulates within your soul beloveds, so your perceptions deepen, your understandings change, your capacity to love heightens, broadens, and these changes will be deep and profound. You will come to know your true self in all its glory and beauty and loveliness.

Beloved souls, great change is coming to this world. Those things that you see in the world now, these upheavals and imbalances are but a foreshadowing of what is to come. The world will indeed heal itself, it will come to a balance.  Those who are willing to adapt and to accept this new way of being in the world, a way that is predicated on love and sensitivity, that embraces the laws of God’s Creation, respects and loves each other, will find this transition much less dramatic and will be able to adapt accordingly for God will guide you through these upheavals and traumas. To walk in life within the flow of God’s Love, to open your ears and eyes to the Will of God, to be sincere and honest with yourselves so that you may release those burdens and disharmonies within you so that you may harmonize with this new Reality, this new Light that is coming, then you will have the opportunity to lead others into Light, but you must be strong. You must recognize the strength of your souls. You must be able to hear the Will of God, to be humble but steadfast in the Truth. So much of what man lives today is illusion, an illusion that gives them the impression that they are safe, but what they have created has created a buffer, insulated them from the consequences of their error and darkness, confusion. For each of you the challenge is to pull back the illusions, that curtain, and look truthfully at the state of this world and indeed the state of your own inner world.  This takes strength. This takes faith. This is an act of Love to see clearly how you must step forward in Love, how you must seek greater harmony within yourself and within your world. Each soul upon this planet is being invited to do so, to have a deeper look, to walk a more harmonious path, rather than seeking that which gratifies them, to seek that which brings harmony to all. 

Each of you, if you so desire, will have a role to teach, to inspire those who are able to listen, how to go about bringing greater harmony, how to access that infinite ocean of Love that is God’s Love, how to utilize these Laws, this Truth, to strengthen and harmonize your own souls to receiving this gift of Love. First you must be examples. You must be strong in this Light. You must conduct yourselves accordingly, for each day brings a choice, each day a challenge and a test. How will I be this day? When the world crowds around me, will I run away or will I face the world in Love, and attempt to bring harmony and peace wherever I go? You must remember my beloveds that this strength comes from God. You may willfully conduct these efforts for harmony and peace expressed from the mind, or you may go to your soul each day, drink deep of the well of Love that is presented to you and be strengthened thus. Walking in the flow of God’s Will, His great river of Love, being humble, generous, kind, accepting, truthful, loving. It is in this, you do God’s Work. It is in who you are, a Light that you carry, the words that you speak, the gestures of Love that are expressed through you that you will be known and noticed. You create an opening ever so small within another because you have chosen to give Love, you are strong enough to bring Light. 

Will you accept God’s calling?  Will you assist in the healing of this world? Will you carry the torch of Truth that is so simple, that Love is the most powerful force in the universe, that Love will heal all and bring what you require to bring harmony wherever you go? 

Take up this torch beloved souls, walk this path of Light and we will accompany you, the angels will surround you and you will find that God will guide you in many ways, often surprising and delightful. Keep your ears and eyes open my beloveds. Walk your path of Truth, be a channel of Love and there is no telling what may come in your future as God plans your destiny and you listen to His Whispers and follow His Guidance. 

God bless you beloved souls. I am Augustine and I love you. I am with you. I will continue to guide and support you on your journey for I Iove you, each one, precious souls, precious lights, loved by God.  God bless you. God bless you beloveds.
