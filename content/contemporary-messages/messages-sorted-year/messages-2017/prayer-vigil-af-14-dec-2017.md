# Prayer Vigil

December 14<sup>th</sup>, 2017

Gibsons, B. C.

Received by Al Fike

 

The angels are with you tonight, close by. Keep your prayers to God, intense and constant. Seek to be uplifted. Allow the Light of God’s Touch to keep at bay all the conditions of the material so that you may feel truly bathed in this Light and full of Grace, beloveds. 

Many blessings to you, His Love cascading upon you like a mighty river, a waterfall of Light. You are embraced, you are enveloped, you are in the Grace of God. God bless you beloveds. God bless you. Confucius Loves you beloved souls.
