Orion received by Al Fike

My beloved friends, I am Orion. I see how your prayers are far-reaching, bringing greater light to this world of yours. We see how your desires and earnestness and integrity in prayer and effort continue to open the way for service, for the development of your soulful gifts, for the integration of all aspects of yourself into the unity and oneness that you are meant to be and express in the world. You must continue to be patient, my friends, for these things are not readily built in the conditions of your world. They require great effort from all involved, you upon the material plane and we in the spirit and otherworldly planes who continue to work together to help you to realize your goals and the desires that we carry to be a clear and powerful instrument in the world.

Though we do not have the luxury of a great amount of time because change will come quickly to your world and you do not live as we do for many years on your planet. Thus, the efforts that we make must be effective and efficient so that we may accomplish our mutual goals. The conditions that you bring into this circle greatly determine the depth and breadth of our efforts with you. You must prepare yourselves for our time together. Prepare yourselves in prayer, in thought and deed that is in alignment with the laws that you are well aware of and the laws that govern not only you upon this world but the universe.

We realize this is not easily accomplished when you are so very distracted and bombarded by the human condition and all that this entails. Oh, how complex is your life and how we have compassion for you, beloved friends, for we live in a much simpler way and means of communication and interaction. Though we are well-versed in gifts and abilities that you could not possibly imagine at this time, it does not bring a complication such as what you encounter day-in-and-day-out. Rather, all of the aspects of our spirit, soul and mind integrated together, having access to many profound truths and capacities inherent in the universe and in our very being brings us great joy. The implementation of these things is not difficult.

I do not wish to discourage you because I know that practically everything that you do upon your earthly plane is a struggle and is difficult, for you march against a tide of human endeavour and will, seeking to do God’s Will in harmony with that flow and that light. Yet, you must persist, my beloved friends, and know that there are many who are close to you in spirit, who continue to uphold you, who continue to embrace you and protect you.

You have a great retinue of spirits, each one of you, engaged in this endeavour to assist you upon a magnificent journey, one that is unique in your world as you continue to seek to manifest those of us who are in the spirit body and those in the soul body and are Celestial. This is a great and formidable task indeed. We have talked about this at times. But I wish to reinforce for you that you are not stepping backwards, but forward. Your development is steady if not slow. You continue to come together in this way affirming your commitment and desire to help bring about these gifts. It is your progress forward, your soulful re-development and re-constitution that comes with the inflow of Divine Love that is the key at this time for as we told you, we have done everything possible to instill this gift within each of you. The material aspects of such are well-established.

You cannot move forward without the development and wisdom that comes with a soul fully engaged with God and all things of God, to be in that place of purity and light, to be a true channel of love, to be awakened ever further with a soul realizing its potentials and possibilities. Though as you well know the journey of the soul in this regard is infinite and will not be curtailed in any way, yet, your journey just begins, my friends. As such, there are many things that require your attention and God’s Touch and development upon it through His Love.

So, you will find your way upon a journey that continues to both excite and challenge you, that brings you joy at times and heartache at times for you see your vulnerabilities, your flaws, and your weaknesses. Your mind continues to tally this list. Yet, you know well that God has you on a path that is quite different from this effort to engage with each flaw, those items on your list one by one. This is not how it works on this Path Divine. All of these issues and aspects of yourself are being touched and healed by the Father’s Love. It is in relation to the intensity and power of this Love within you that brings about this healing and transformation.

So, we urge you to pray and pray often. We urge you to be earnest and sincere in your prayers, to open that channel more clearly to God, to be in greater alignment, to seek greater truth and understanding through your soul faculties, and to exercise these faculties and express them in the world. This is a way that is not well understood in your earthly plane. Very few truly recognize the quality of the path that you take, the many aspects that are involved, aspects that are often contrary to the mind and the workings of the material mind. Even the workings of the spirit mind are somewhat contrary to that of the soul mind and this instrument has received information explaining this.

Yes, the road is long. Challenges are great. The obstacles continue to inhibit you. Yet, you persist because within your soul is a great strength, a great capacity to forge ahead, to find at-onement with the Great Creator of the Universe. So you shall, my friends. We will continue to uphold you. Many are upholding you. You will find your way and it will get easier as you continue to grow in God’s Love awakening your soul, so the strength grows and the perceptions grow, and to some degree, the detachment grows within you so you are not so taken by the various challenges and situations in your personal life that draw you away and often bring you grief. You will find a form of detachment that also includes compassion and love and you will not be so immersed in all those feelings that come with the human condition.

Instead, you will find joy. You will have the wisdom to see and perceive the very core of whatever condition is challenging you or whatever is around you that brings its challenges. With wisdom will come greater love and compassion, understanding that as humanity moves forward, it creates its own challenges, lessons and issues that are in need of overcoming.

It is not an easy world but it is your world. It is the gift that God gave you, life upon this world. I urge you to continue to expedite every opportunity and possibility to grow in light, to be a channel of love, and to work toward greater light in this world. In this, you will discover many things, come to know many things and experience many things that are good and joyful and astounding in many respects.

May God bless you on this journey, my friends. I am Orion. I am glad to speak to you today about the challenges that you face. Yet, you, my beautiful friends, the souls that are a light with love, continue. You are persistent. You have great strength. So, we will carry on. Indeed, we will carry on, my beautiful friends. May God bless you deeply. My love is with you always.
