# The Way

I am Lao Tzu

Extremes create disparities and disparities create much unhappiness
So, find yourself in a place of comfort that does not infringe upon others 
but rather, includes them
For even though each one must walk their own path
All are on a journey to the same place
All wish to be free
 to be loved
 and to love
It is not in the extremes of anything where happiness lies
But rather in simply being 
Allowing oneself to be a vessel of love 
Allowing the Creator of the Universe to touch you
to fill you
And that overflowing is never extreme 
I have been here in spirit for a great many centuries 
And I live in bliss (and)
 I am happy that my writings give people balance give people a way to be
But I now add that allowing the blessings of heaven in your lives will transform you from human to divine
This is happiness!
So
Allow love and balance and the realization that we are all equal in the eyes of the Creator
 So if you wish to be as Jesus said “perfect as the Father” greet all with His love in equal measure.
And that is the Way

I am Lao Tzu
