Prof Salyards received by Al Fike

May God bless you, this is your Professor Salyards here. I'm happy that you have come to some conclusions and insights as to what the next steps are regarding your Gathering of Souls. Indeed, there is much to be done and my only concern about your approach is that you may get bogged down in the details rather than have the insight and sense of what it is that God wants in this effort.

How does one come to know what God wants? How does one come to know the guidance that is given? We may certainly speak through this instrument or others to bring guidance through but this is not the most convenient way to communicate. It is important that each of you receives your guidance on a daily basis and is aware of that guidance, to be true to that guidance and to be confident in that guidance. Rather than step forward in a rather inconsistent way, it is important that your footfalls are done smoothly and daily, bringing you closer to the goal and in alignment with God's Will.

How is one able to perceive God and His guidance? One must be sensitized, one must feel their way through the process of soul awareness and understanding. It does not come by attending a program or reading a passage or having some intellectual understanding of the process. Indeed many wish to take that route in order to assure themselves that these things are viable and feasible. Yet, in essence, it is your soul awakening to consciousness, of being in the flow of God's Love and God's Will. In this way, whatever you may plan, whatever may be the outcomes of your efforts, God is included in the process. Guidance comes more readily because you have opened the door to it. You have accepted it and have have come to utilize the information, the knowledge, the wisdom, and the love that comes when God is included in your efforts, in your life.

Do not separate these two components, my beloved brothers and sisters, but integrate them well so that with everything you do, how you move in the world, what God contributes, and how God orchestrates the flow of events that come to be expressed in the harmony are all benefits of having God's blessings upon you and through you. It is too easy to hesitate, to worry, and to continue to have deep questions and concerns that arise from your mindful considerations. This is the way of the material world but indeed, what you are doing together is something different from this. It is reaching out to be God’s servants, to be in alignment with God's Will and to know God's Will. This requires a different conversation, a different perspective and different perceptions.

As you become more attuned in your faculties and abilities, knowing the ways and means that God wishes to communicate and guide, then those things that you are feeling compelled to express in your life and your instrumentality in the world will have greater harmony and flow more beautifully. It will be deeper and resonate more fully with your own soul and with the souls of those around you, It is in the awakening of these faculties and trusting in them, honoring them, and feeling sure of them in the way that faith grows in it. An opening between yourself and God that the true Will of God, the purpose that God places before you, the opportunities that are available to you may come to be realized. Indeed, as you plan your events and your efforts, make sure that you are including God in your thoughts, actions and deeds. For without God involved, what do you have? You have another material manifestation of human will upon the world and this is not what you need or wish to come about. What you desire is to do God's Will.

It is important for each of you to challenge yourself to go deeper within that place which is of the soul in order to understand God's Will and the way that God may guide you and inspire you, the way that we in the celestial heavens may come to your assistance and work with you in order to realize the intended goal that is God's plan and Will in the world. These things are at your fingertips, my beloved friends, they are not difficult to understand or to ascertain in your life. It is merely your patterns of thought, the restrictions that you carry that come with these patterns that often block the way to understanding and knowing in the way of the soul and relationship with the great Over Soul, that is God.

Make efforts to change these patterns of thought. Make efforts to be aware of them. Make efforts to understand the source of them so that you may truly release yourself from the human condition so to be effective instruments in the world. Whatever it is that you come together to create, to express as a beautiful group of souls seeking to do God's will, it will be beautiful, it will be harmonious, and it will be in alignment with the truths and laws of God's Love. I urge you forward, my beloved friends. I urge you to release any anxieties you may have in moving forward. I urge you to pray and have faith in what God might give you and how all the you do that is within and embraced by the hand of God will be magnificent.

May God bless you, my friends, I am Professor Salyards and I continue to come to support you, to tutor you, to love you. And so I shall...and so I shall. God bless you, beloved friends. In the name and truth and beauty of God's Love may we be blessed with a constant inflowing of His Essence. My love is with you, beloved friends, God bless you.
