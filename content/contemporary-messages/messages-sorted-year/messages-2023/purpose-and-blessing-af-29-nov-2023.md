Beloveds, I am Jesus. I come to pray with you and to open this circle to all those who wish to join and be a part of our prayer vigil for love, truth and light and to break down any barriers, any conditions that are contrary to this purpose and this truth. For each of you are being prepared for your ministries, the time to come when service to God will be the utmost importance of your life.

Some of you have already dedicated yourselves in this way. Some contemplate this dedication. Some desire it but do not know how to go about it. We are here to help you, beloved souls, to find clarity and purpose. To know your gifts and to express your gifts in such a way that others will benefit. God will use you as His channels of love in the world. 

Each soul must progress beyond his present condition that all that is not of love may fall away. All that is meant to be of love will be accentuated and awakened so that the journey ahead will be clear and filled with surety and joy. We are here to serve God and there are many angels here, beloved souls. 

Though you are a modest circle, each one has come because they were called. Each one will come away from this circle with greater insight, understanding and capacity to love. We shall all work together, beloveds. A great force for good, an opening for God to work and to bring many blessings forth to your brothers and sisters. 

There is little time and much to do, my friends, beloved children of God. So, we arrange for these Circles of Light to help facilitate and to bring forth what is needed. Do not have specific expectations of this group. Rather go with God’s plan and our plan, which is a reflection of God’s plan, so that we may proceed accordingly and walk in the light with great harmony and love. 

We do not put more upon you than what you can deal with and express. We do not insist, but we give guidance and we allow you your choices. We are not here to force you into anything. Rather we are here to invite you into something greater and more in the light, more within the flow of God’s Will, more an expression of His Love within you. 

We give much to you, my beloved friends. We shall do so out of love and respect and a desire to uplift you and to show you the many possibilities that are before you that may be a reflection of your love and your choices. Be at peace, and know that God’s Hand is upon you and shall be so for the rest of your lives and beyond. 
I thank you for coming together, for being together in such harmony, for acknowledging one another for the beautiful lights that you are, and for seeking higher truth, greater service, to understand the possibilities and the opportunities that God lays before you. We will utilise this time together to explore these things, to understand more fully your own gifts, to help you to see the way forward in your service to God and your instrumentality in the world.

God bless you, my beloved friends. I come with love, a channel for God’s Love. I come in peace and a blessing of peace upon you. I come in truth that the truth may enter into your souls and come forth into your consciousness. I come because I love you, each one of you precious souls, children of God, that you may awaken and find your true selves in all its glory and light, goodness and beauty. 

God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus and I love you, beloved souls. I love you.
