# How God has Brought Us all Together

May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

I am your teacher, Augustine. Consider all the choices, all the actions, all the thoughts and desires that have brought you to this place together at this moment. Consider all that is in the world that is made possible, this moment together from all around the world, and in the relationship of tiny particles of matter that dance about in your material world. All the wonderment of God’s Creation, the magnificence of every soul, the power of God’s Soul to touch your soul and all of these wondrous things in the universe, these things that have brought us all together in love.

God’s orchestration that has created the possibilities of our coming together in this way and God’s gift of a soul that created the yearnings that started the chain of events that has brought you here. How magnificent is His Creation? How magnificent are each of you, beloved souls? How wondrous is the Will of God whose flow has brought you to this place? My beloved, beloved students, realise the depth and breadth, how profound is the gift of bringing all of us together in all of these different ways, and how God has made it possible to reach out to one another, to reach out to Him, and how He makes it possible for the angels of Heaven to surround you and pray with you, how He brings His healing Touch upon you, uplifting you in peace and joy and love, how it is that life has such potential and that within you are such gifts.

You are truly blessed, beloved souls. You are truly blessed. So, we continue this journey, wading deeper into the river of God’s Will and Love, seeking the magnificence of a soul redeemed and alive. We journey together, beloved souls. We are truly brothers and sisters, some further along this path than others and yet in this unity we are equal in God’s eyes and in His Love.

God bless you. God bless you deeply. I am your teacher Augustine and I love you all. I recognise you all as my brothers and sisters upon this magnificent path. We continue as our beloved Master indicates. We shall seek greater light and greater love always and forevermore. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love. I love you, beloveds.
