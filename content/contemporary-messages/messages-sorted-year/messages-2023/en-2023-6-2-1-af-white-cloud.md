# Wake Up to Your Personal Responsibility

June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

White Cloud received by Al Fike

I come to be with you in prayer, beloved friends. I am White Cloud. I ask the Creator to open your souls, awaken what is within you with the great Love that is the Source of all things.

For you to open your eyes, my friends, you must first put aside all those ideas and thoughts that you bring with you from a life lived in a world that has been created by man, ideas and perceptions that have been cultivated within you from the beginning. These things now become irrelevant. Their truth is lost in the shadow of man’s inhumanity, man’s ignorance, man’s desire and lust for power and control over the Earth. Humanity cannot continue to live like this. It is poisoning everything. It is taking the very vitality from our Mother Earth and utilising all her resources, all that she gives so willingly, without thought of replenishment, without thought of harmony.

Where will the wisdom come? How will you come to understand what it is that you require to do in order to replenish your beloved and sacred Mother? It can only come from deep within, from that place where wisdom grows and is a part of the brightness, the light within you. You have a soul. It is time to utilise the perceptions and wisdom of your soul to truly understand the journey on this Earth, to grasp what is important, to express what is in harmony, to honour one another as the children of the Creator, to honour your Mother Earth as the one who feeds and nurtures you from cradle to grave.

Can you see this truly, my beloved friends? It requires a great depth of love, that love that grows within you, requires the faculties, the abilities, the vision and sight of the soul to understand, to truly understand, what is required. You pray for guidance. You pray to be aware and awakened. Can you truly accept this awakening, embrace it in such a way that it becomes a part of you, a part of your life?

You do not see with the blindness of man’s ignorance, but with the piercing truth of God’s Wisdom and Truth. It takes strength, my friends. It takes great strength to walk in truth, to live in truth, to be a living example of truth. Can you step just one footfall in this direction, one step at a time, one decision and choice and effort and prayer at a time? For, how else can you accomplish this but to walk forward in faith, in truth, in trust that what you require is coming and will come from God, not from the willful desires and perceptions of man? For this is what has led you to such a dark place in this world. Rather, it is time to wipe the slate clean and start anew in your perceptions, in your values, in what you hold dear and what motivates you in your life.

The messages have come to you from many different directions, that it is time for change, and that the time of change is upon us. Listen carefully, my friends, for Mother Earth weeps in pain. The animals, the creation of God, are all in pain and disarray, the very cycles of the Earth disrupted. Great fires and floods and wind, as the Earth is in turmoil, continue to intensify. Balance needs to be struck, my friends. Balance will be struck. For, in the laws of God the Creator, there are mechanisms that will right the imbalance. But which side will you be on when that righting takes place, when all is brought to healing and grace? For those who are not in alignment with this shall suffer greatly. You have been warned many times and from many different places that there is deep, deep distress in your world.

Be part of the effort to bring balance and peace and love. Seek out the Will of God. Seek out what in your heart knows to be in harmony. For there are many sensible solutions within you. There are many ways in which you may live in honour of your creation and God’s Creation and all of what is of creation. Be within that way of thought and awareness and being, and you will be part of the solution. God will utilise you in many ways to bring healing and light. It will come in many surprising, yet wonderful expressions of your gifts and your being.

As more and more come into alignment with the Will of God, the way of God, then the healing process will gain momentum and the balance will be struck in time. For the Earth will not be lost and a victim of the will of man. The Earth shall flourish within the Will and creation of God. This must be. It is a universal law that all must come into harmony and balance, and so it shall be. Consider this, my friends of Earth, consider what you may do, how you may act, how you may be an instrument of the Creator for the good of all.

May God bless you in love, the love that shall shine within your souls and shall accumulate there with all your prayers, desires and yearnings, a light growing, a light needed, a light powerful in the world. May you be blessed, beloveds, beautiful souls of God. I am White Cloud. My love for you is great. I come to support you in light. Blessings of the Creator to each of you.
