# Know that You are Loved

I want you to know how loved you are, beloveds, and how God, and His expression of love, shines through His angels and the bright spirits who attend to you. God’s hand is always upon you, beloveds, you are being protected and guided, blessed and healed, uplifted in light. In your dreams, the sweetness of love permeates and brings light in your restful state of repose, that in your daily lives, wherever the opportunity is there God brings light and love to you. 

All that you do and aspire towards, it is your soul yearning for awakening, coming to life. That is the great purpose of your journey in life. It is our desire and our focus in effort and prayer to assist you in this awakening, to open to all that which is within you that aspires towards light and truth and love. These things come because God loves you and, in His Love, makes every opportunity, every effort to bring you closer to Him and to bring you into greater alignment with His Laws of Love. 

May you be aware of those blessings, the cues that God places before you to say to you, “I love you.” May you appreciate all that is made on your behalf to bring you to greater light. May you be aware and eager to embrace these blessings, both small and large. For there is much given to each of you, beloved souls, much that is flowing towards you, light that is available to you. It is unrestricted, abundant, all encompassing. But you must open yourselves willingly, with great intent and focus upon the journey that is yours and yours alone so that you may be in greater alignment with your Heavenly Father, so that you may walk the path of love and reap the benefits of this path and gift. 

There is much waiting for each of you. Do not limit what can be given, but strive evermore to open wide and receive so that in these gifts and blessings you may grow stronger in light, in truth and love. In this way, you may reciprocate God’s blessings by being His instruments in the world, lights upon this world. Be guided by Him to reach out to your brothers and sisters, so many who are lost and alone and in need of comfort. Be God’s instrument, beloveds. Be His child of truth, His Soul resplendent in Love, that which He has created and shall live for all eternity.

May God bless you. I am Mary and know that I love each of you dearly and shall be with you always. My beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, children of God, we are together in light, the blessings of His Love. God bless you. I love you and will always love you. I embrace you and I am here to uplift you and comfort you in love. God bless you.
