Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



I am here John, called the Beloved. May the light of God’s love fill every soul here. Know that you are a precious child of the Heavenly Father, Who wishes you to be at one in very substance in the receiving of His gift, the gift of Divine Love, free to all for the simple asking from the soul to receive. For all who are in need of healing we encourage you to go into a safe still place. And though you may feel alone there, the longings of your heart and your soul will bring the company of Angels, the love of God and, as is said, *“Every good and perfect gift”.* You may not see all the workings of the Grace of God, yet your soul perceives all, receives all, in its connection. Soul made in the image of the Creator with the wonderful possibility of At-One-Ment in very substance. You are the soul! 
  
All manner of blessings are available to you for the simple asking, for at the end of the day, it is about love. Human love and the love of God, may they be yours in great abundance. I thank you. I am your brother in Christ and your Celestial friend. I am John. Go in peace. I love you; God loves you.
