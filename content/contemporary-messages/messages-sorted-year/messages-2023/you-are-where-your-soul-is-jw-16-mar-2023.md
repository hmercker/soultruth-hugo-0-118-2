# You are where your soul is

I have been following along today with great interest, not only in the encouragement to be still but in what it takes to align one’s soul with the Heavenly Father.

I ask you to consider this. You have what you call your life with your work, your play, your gifts, all the things you are attracted to, and your aspirations
as well as your concerns The entire gamut of human experience laid before you as you sit on your chair, on your couch, on your bed, in your car, or bustling about going through your day. Consider that you are a soul in a Universe so vast it is not measurable. Even with the simplicity of realizing that you are in a place, in a country, on a planet in the solar system and in a galaxy one of perceived billions, where are you? 

I tell you these things because I wish you to know that you are exactly where your soul is. A soul that is not encumbered by time and space even though encased in a physical being with a spirit body. The soul is your connection to eternity and where your soul is, you are. Perhaps I should put this in another way. As you try to be calm, be still, and be free from worry and concern and ultimately to be love, you must go into your soul. This is the seat of your being. The heart as we have always said is the doorway, for it is the emotional and feeling center. The mind can inspire but the soul the seat of being is where understanding transcends belief. And as the prayer<sup>1</sup> goes receiving the love as to have such Faith as cause one to know that you are truly at one with your Creator.

Allow yourselves to be astonished at creation and allow your soul, which the great gift made in the Father’s image, to be opened in love that you may feel evermore the presence of the Creator. That you may truly transcend the world in the vibration that is Divine in its source, the bridge between heaven and earth. Consider these things as the freedom from gravity in every sense of that word. Have we not told you that Divine Love is anti-gravitational, free from the earthly weight of the world?

So, pray and be still and allow God to bless you in any moment and when you feel His love send it out to every being. Be in joy! I thank you and I love you. As it has been said and we will continue to say ‘Seek ye first the Kingdom’, and have hope, hope of awakening, hope of transformation.

May God bless you. I am your brother, your friend, and your guide in Christ. I am Judas.
