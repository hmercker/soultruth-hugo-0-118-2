Jesus received by Al Fike

May the peace and glory of His Love rain upon you, beloved souls, my disciples all, who carry the banner of truth. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to bless and to uphold and to encourage you, my beloveds, upon the Path Divine. May the gifts of His Love continue to awaken you, refresh you, and transform you. It is given freely to those who seek it and ask for it. It is given to each of you who have found your way to this truth. It is given to all souls who are eager to be with God in His Love.

I bless you, beloved souls, each one, beautiful lights, beautiful souls created by God and all the wonderment and glory of God’s Creation. May you be blessed and uplifted. May you come to know the purity and grace of a soul transformed in love. May you know the peace that passes all understanding. May you be free of the burdens of this dark world and walk in the freedom and light of the Father’s Hand upon you. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. My love is with you. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom, and your brother and friend. God bless you.
