My brothers and sisters. May the love of God fill your souls. May His spirit be upon you. 
   
There have been many words given to express the simplicity of prayer. It is a human tendency to align with like souls and this tendency can produce a wide array of results. For when one aligns with pure desire in the material world, what one gains in things, one often sacrifices in love and light. When one aligns with love and makes that their primary focus, all good things come to that one. 

Of course, many a redeemed soul started off as a sinner and even the vilest sinners come to redemption in God’s time. For you who have come to this circle, knowledgeable of the truths of God’s kingdom, knowledgeable of the great gift of God’s love, aware that the traditions have all been corrupted in one way or another, you can still realize that all beings, whatever their beliefs, hunger for love and those whose souls truly open in prayer to God, who hunger for that connection with our Father, are transformed in a never-ending journey to the fountainhead of God’s love. Their destinies to arrive on the celestial shores in the kingdom of God’s love where every unique soul is at one in love. 
     
It does not matter where you reside. It makes no difference your tribe, your genetics, your physicality, how you identify. It only matters that you love. That you allow God to touch you. It is that simple. In any moment to send the longings of your souls in humility, in asking with words or beyond for this great love of God to be yours. It is free and it is priceless, and I may say, if you don’t already understand, it is everything that one could truly wish for. Let us be at one with the Father’s love, letting go, letting God, letting grace. All things are healed. All things become clear. 

As my [brother Yogananda has said](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2023/the-progression-of-the-soul-jw-16-oct-2023/), in this Christ consciousness, Christos meaning anointed, as I became and as you are becoming, in the love of God. Allow this. Be joyful. Sing a song of praise. Support each other and allow your gifts to unfold, that you may be a blessing on this earth and beyond. I’m very pleased my brother has agreed tonight to allow me to speak and I bless each one in the Father’s love. I am your brother and eternal friend. I am Jesus.
