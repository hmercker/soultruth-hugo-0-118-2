Blessings to you, beloved souls. Yes I do come from far away, from the Celestial Kingdom which is far removed from the earthly plane. I am Josephus and I come to speak to you about the work and efforts that are being made in order to strengthen the light, the light of truth in the world. 

Indeed, as each of you step forward in dedication and prayer, a desire to serve God, desire to serve humanity, so God utilises your harmonious connection with the Divine in order to strengthen and develop the lines of communication, the great portals of blessings and this great Lattice, a network of light that is created amongst you. Each of you through your desires, your prayers, your willingness, your openness, the power of the great Love of God building within your soul, the gifts that you possess, all that you are and all that you are becoming in this material world has contributed to the flow, to the building up and upliftment of your material world.
 
For it takes great effort indeed, to shift the consciousness of man from that of the old ways of the intellect and man’s dedication to these mindful things to that which is  more in harmony with God’s laws of love and creation. For the mindful dedications that are so prevalent in your world are merely one side of a coin, a coin that also has upon it the soulful understanding and experiences that come with this relationship with God. The one-sided coin brings great imbalance, great disharmony. Yet when there are both aspects of humanity incorporated together in harmony, in balance, then there are many blessings that may come, a great thrust of energy and focus toward light, toward all that which is of light. 

You have found the way, the journey toward this. God has ensured that you understand, have come to be enlightened into this journey, this way of being that is intended for all souls upon this Earth and all souls within the spirit world.

In time, the material mind and capacities are fused with the soul mind and its capacities, but this fusion is quite distant before it is a reality in your life. For now, it is important that you make great effort to establish the balance between these two aspects of your consciousness. As you do so, then you allow greater light and greater blessings to flow to each of you. You also allow these aspects and blessings that God has placed upon the Earth, these portals of light, these great networks of light, the fellowship and connection that you share together. All of these things help strengthen the establishment of the truth upon this Earth. Not that the truth was never here but rather, the truth was barely known. 

Our beloved brother and master, Jesus, brought this truth to the Earth. He taught it well. He was a wonderful example of how the great Touch of God’s Love may transform the soul. Through the millennia, efforts have been made to make connection and contact with humanity to help sustain this truth in some way. Indeed, these efforts brought feeble results and many did not understand this truth until sometime within the spirit world that they had come to know the great invitation of God to join Him in the Divinity of His Love. 

Yet now this truth is becoming known. Now there is the possibility that many may know this truth. Indeed, it is important that each of you contribute to the foundation of this dissemination of truth, that each of you is dedicated, at least in prayer, to the efforts that we from the Celestial Kingdom are making in order to bring to consciousness this truth to mankind. It is taking a great effort, a great dedication of many, many souls most certainly within the spirit world and the Celestial Kingdom to help lift up humanity, to lift up this world in light. For, if the world is not lifted, then how can all that surrounds your world, all the spheres of spirit, all the humanity that exists in the spirit world as well as material world, how are they going to be uplifted into light. For much of humanity is ignorant, has no idea of what it is that their souls yearn for and what it is their souls have purpose for. It is for you to teach this truth, beloved souls. It is for you to experience this truth first and foremost, and then to share your experiences, your understanding to all those who are willing to listen.

The world must enter into a new phase of being and expression. This is God’s Will. This is God’s plan and each and every one of you is crucial in this effort. Each and every one of you has something to contribute, have gifts. Gifts that many of you do not realise you have, that can be used for the awakening of humanity. Many of you feel that you have just woken from your state of slumber and ignorance of the truth and this may be true. Yet, with each level of awakening accomplished, you will be able to be God’s instruments, to a degree that is greater as you grow in love, as your souls develop in love, as your capacity to perceive, to understand, to know, to love, to be in harmony with God’s laws, continues to grow. It grows exponentially as you receive this gift in greater abundance. 

My beloved and beautiful friends, I urge you to awaken fully, to be those beautiful lights that you are meant to be, utilising those beautiful capacities of your soul that are ever waiting to be realised and expressed in the world. Each of you has something special to share, something beautiful to give to the world. Find yourself in deep communion with God. Open to God’s guidance, His sweet whispers into your soul so that you may be empowered, enlightened and given great capacities as an agent of change, as God’s instruments, channels of love. These things await each one of you. None of you are incapable. All of you are indeed greatly blessed and have within you and upon you great dispensations from God in order that you may grow and become the beautiful lights that I speak of. 

Be strong in the love, the Love of God, the power of this love to transform you and awaken you. It is what the world needs at this time, the world desperately needs the awakening that God intends. As you touch many more you will give them the opportunity to avoid the heartache, problems and terrible reactions that will come as God insists upon the changing, the transformation of your world from darkness to light. 
It comes quickly, beloved souls. Each of you have made the choice for light but many have not. I urge you, I urge you to bring this truth to as many as possible before the deluge of great change is upon you and the opportunities to avoid the pain and suffering that will result. They will lessen as your capacities for communication and to be together in ways such as this are diminished. Be true to the Will of God. Ask and listen. Be His instruments of faith and who and what you are and who and what God is. In this way, you open great capacities of communication and blessings upon you. 

May you continue to grow, beloved souls, in great light, nourished and uplifted, blessed and comforted. May God bless you deeply. I am Josephus and my love for you is great, my compassion for what the world has become, my joy for what the world is meant to be. May God bless you and keep you in His Love and I love you as well. God bless you.
