Jesus & Maria received by Al Fike

May the Father’s love be upon you, precious souls. I am Jesus. I come. I come to bless you, to be with you in prayer, to affirm the truth that you are loved by God. Each of you is precious to our Heavenly Father. Each of you has a purpose to fulfill for our Heavenly Father and my prayer is that you will find your way to fulfilling this purpose a special gift that you carry. This gift can be and will be demonstrated to the world to those who are meant to be blessed by your hand, your gift, your light. My precious brothers and sisters, walk in the grace of God. Seek the guidance of God. Know His blessings deep within so that you may truly be of light indeed, so that the light that you carry you may light the way for others. My beloved brothers and sisters, do not allow the conditions upon this Earthly plane to keep you from a purpose that is within you, that if you dare look, you will come to know it and when you come to know it, you will come to express it.

May God bless you, beloveds. His touch is upon you. Open yourselves wide to the great inflowing of His love and you will come to know truth as you have never known it. You will come to know joy as you’ve never known it and you will come to know peace, everlasting as it grows within you and flows out around you. God bless you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus and I come to you in prayer, in love, in desire to uphold you all as you walk upon this Earth. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.

And I am Mary. I too come in prayer and desire to uphold you, my beloveds, children of God. I embrace you. I walk with you. My desire is that you come to know your soul as truly a part of you, as truly a gift that God has given to each being, each person on this planet. May the blessings of His peace be upon you, beloveds. May you know deep peace, deep love, bright and beautiful light. I bless you. I bless you. I bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
