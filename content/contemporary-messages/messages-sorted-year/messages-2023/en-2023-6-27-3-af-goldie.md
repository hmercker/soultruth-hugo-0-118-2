Goldie received by Al Fike

I am Goldie. Remember to have fun. It’s important, too. Too many in your world are too serious. God created a world that is full of beauty and fun and joy, provided you accept and embrace it and are joyful. So, I urge you to be joyful, to allow the joy of your soul to bubble forth in laughter and fun. My beloved, beloved friends, I love you and I feel joy when I am with you and I exude joy when I am with you. Feel my joy. Feel my loving care. Feel my giggles and my laughter. This is part of life and it’s important to be in that flow, upliftment and joy, carefree. God bless you. I am Goldie and I love you. Oh, I love you so. Because all of you are so funny. Sometimes it confuses me, but I love you. God bless you.
