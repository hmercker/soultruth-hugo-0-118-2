John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am John and I welcome you all to this circle of light, this blessed event in which we will share our love with our brothers and sisters, some of whom are here and some who are coming. Please recognize that there will be others unlike yourselves who will be in attendance, in part because of their curiosity, in part because of the longing within themselves to learn more, to seek truth, to find truth. Each of you will be assisting these souls to find the truth of God’s love for them. And I may say this will be successful for the powerful nature of the love in your souls will satisfy some of their longings and they will continue intermittently come back to this love. And this, dear children of God, is all that we ask of you. This is how you may serve your brothers and sisters upon the Earth. This is an example for you to follow.

My love is with you, each one of you and my sister, my beloved. I thank you for listening. I thank God for bringing us all together. May God bless you abundantly this day and open your hearts and souls so that God’s love may flow through you. I am John.
