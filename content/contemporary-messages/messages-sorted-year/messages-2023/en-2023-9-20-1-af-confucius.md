Confucius received by Al Fike

Greetings and blessings to you, beloved souls. I am Confucius. I come to speak to these seekers of light and truth who are earnest in their search and who desire all that which is of love and light, of universal blessings upon you, beloved souls. Most upon your Earth begin their journey with the mind questioning the purpose of life, their own being and their relationship with the world. Many go upon this journey seeking answers, asking questions, finding the answers through others and through their own experience.

There is another level of truth and fulfilment of this journey. It comes not with the material mind, but from the soul and the consciousness of soul, that place within that is deep and eternal, that place that carries the capacities to understand truth from the perspective that is the soul’s ability to perceive beyond the mind, and to perceive God and know God in a way that the mind can only speculate, yet the soul knows. We, from the Celestial Kingdom, come to you on Earth to teach you of this way, the way of the soul, so that when you travel upon the Earth and beyond, you will have a truth, an understanding, that is far beyond that which the mind can give you, beloveds.

This journey begins with love and continues with love, eternal love. Eternal love comes from only one source, and that is the Creator of all the universe. The Creator is of Love. This Love is given by your longing. desire and prayers to receive it, to know the special Essence that shall transform you and awaken you to the glories of Divine creation and beautiful aspects from within. I ask you, beloved souls, I ask you, seek the truth of God. In whatever way you see your Creator, focus upon this place, this Source, and seek to be blessed, to be touched by it, and you will then know the truth that I speak of. You will feel its touch within you. You will know its effects upon you, transforming you, beloved souls, from that which is of mortal and human, to that which is Divine. The ultimate goal, is it not? To be that divine light, that being that is in alignment with all that is of the Divine, to be freed from the inhibitions of the human condition and to know the glories and joy of a soul redeemed in love, transformed by the Touch of God. This is our message, beloved souls. This we seek to teach all souls and we plant these seeds in many, so that someday soon, they will come to that place of longing and faith in the truth of God’s Love.

May God bless you, beloved souls. May you come to know this awakening of which I speak and come to join us on the eternal journey that comes with this blessing as it accumulates within your souls and expands and becomes a great light so that your consciousness may have the ability and capacities to perceive the breadth and length of the universe and all that God has created therein. Not by the limitations of the material mind, but by the expansion and limitless perceptions of the soul. We speak of soul, beloveds. We speak of what it is that within you, you seek.

Your souls long to be with God. Your desires deep within are to be loved. When you answer this calling from within, you will find yourselves liberated in the light, joy and beauty of Divine touch and awakening. May you be blessed, beloveds, blessed with knowledge, blessed with understanding, blessed with the joy that is love, the Love Divine and awakened. All your faculties, all that God has created within you, these wondrous potentials that reside within the soul, may be awakened by His Touch, by the longing and opening of your soul to God in humility and grace, in peace, in love.

God bless you, beloveds. I am Confucius and I am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom. I come to speak to you, to encourage you on your journey. Know that when you seek for the highest, the Angels of the Celestial Kingdom will be by your side assisting you on this journey, helping you to realise what this journey truly is, and to understand the wonders of God. God bless you. I honour you all, beloved souls of Earth. Be a light on this world of yours so in need of light. Be of love for your brothers and sisters. Walk upon the path to God and you will find great blessings, great fulfilment, great love upon this path. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you all.
