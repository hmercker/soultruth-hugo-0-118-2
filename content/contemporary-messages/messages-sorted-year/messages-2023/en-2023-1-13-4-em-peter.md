Peter received by Elizabeth Mack

My most beloved souls, I am Peter and I come to enjoin you to see the Truth in the message that I gave through another instrument, our dear brother, Al. With your souls extended, with your hearts uplifted to our heavenly Father, you will see clearly all that was given to you with the deepest of love. Care not for the material provisions that you feel that you need. Care for your souls. Care for your souls for they are eternal. They will bring you with the love in them, all that you need, always and forever. Fear not, dearest children, true children of the Father. You are children of God. You are loved, deeply from all your different places along this path, you are loved and will be brought forward each and every time you turn to God. And, yes, love your brothers and sisters. Love them with your whole being for that is what the Father wishes for all of His children, to love with this eternal gift of love that you are given. It is simple. It is so simple: heart and soul living the love. I and many others who are here with you, embrace you in this love and lift you up, that you may come closer to the greatest love there is. We love you truly. We bring you now closer to the seat of all love. God bless you, children. God bless you.
