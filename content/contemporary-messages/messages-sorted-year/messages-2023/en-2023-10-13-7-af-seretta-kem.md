When we speak to you, when we teach you, we do not primarily speak to your minds, we speak to your souls. We seek to educate your souls that you may come to understand truth from that deep place where truth will reside forever, where you will understand in such a place that is solid and immovable. That you may act and express yourself from the wisdom that comes from that place. That you may be enlightened by the Love of God that will bring to you truth to your consciousness in such a way that you understand on many levels how truth may be applied to your life. How truth may be your treasure, your gift given by God through His intermediaries, through the Holy Spirit, through His blessings upon you.

Truth will grow within you. Not from your mind to your soul, but from your soul to your mind. This is how truth emerges into your consciousness. Your mind may have an inkling of truth, a structure of truth that has been built from words, from books, from messages that we deliver, from many different sources. The integration, the solidity of truth that grows within you comes from your soul, building and growing in God's Love. In this way, you gain the faculties and abilities to understand truth, to truly know truth, to recognise it.

 Discernment will grow as well so that when you hear truth spoken around you and through the experiences of your life, you may acknowledge it as truth. It is a conscious thing that comes to you from that deep place that knows and will continue to grow in its knowing, the understanding of life, of what God has created, of what God is. These things will grow within you. In time you will be strong enough, clear enough within you that you may teach these things to others and teach them how to gain truth, the mechanisms of knowing and growing in truth.

May you truly know what God wishes to give to you, what is flowing towards you always. May you receive with humility and grace the deep Touch from God that will awaken truth within you and bring you to all things of God's creation that is of light and truth, harmony and love. May you be blessed, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem, and I love you dearly. I love you dearly. God bless you, seekers of truth, seekers of love. May you be blessed with love. God bless you.
