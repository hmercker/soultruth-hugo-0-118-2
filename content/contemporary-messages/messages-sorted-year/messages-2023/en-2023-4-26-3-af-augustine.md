# There's More Work to Do

April 26<sup>th</sup>, 2023

10th Anniversary DLSF, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustinus received by Al Fike

I am your teacher, Augustine. I have tutored these two beautiful souls. I have tutored many of you over the years. I have seen you grow. I have seen your souls be transformed in the Father’s Love and how you are well upon your journey, beloved and beautiful students of truth and love.

There is much more to come. There is much more work to do. That work will expand and encompass many other souls as the world beckons you forward, and as God incorporates your skills and gifts into His plan for the salvation of this world and for humanity. So you will find the depth and breadth, the scope of your work will indeed expand. The people that you will meet will be many, diverse, many who do not aspire to the Divine Love as you know it and teach it. Yet, they are drawn by the light, they are drawn by the love, they are drawn because their souls know there is something that you carry that they long for.

Be confident in your efforts and trust in the Will of God. Do not doubt, but step forward with a bravery and a tenacity that will penetrate the resistance and darkness in your world and bring greater light and truth to it. You are all being called, beloved souls, to act as God’s channels and instruments of light. Heed that call. Acknowledge God’s plan and Will for you. In this way indeed, as has been said, many surprises will come, many blessings, many things that you cannot possibly dream of will be a part of your life. When that time comes for you to look back upon your life, you will acknowledge with great appreciation and love and joy, what wonderment God has brought to you and your experience in life.

You will find fulfillment in spiritual work. You will find that the truth will carry you forward through anything and all conditions that may come to you. You will find with a soul filled with love, that you will understand many things and come to appreciate God’s Creation and the potentials that come with obeying of His laws and coming into alignment with His great Soul.

May you step forward, my friends, and truly be that child of God, that servant of God, that instrument of peace in the world. God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine. My love is with you all. God bless you, my friends, beautiful students of truth. May every day bring greater blessings, greater insight, greater peace, and greater joy. God bless you.
