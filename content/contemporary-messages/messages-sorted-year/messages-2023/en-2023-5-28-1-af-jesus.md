# Blessings from Jesus on Pentecost

May 28<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

â€¦Love shed upon you, beloveds. I am Jesus. I come and speak of that time of the Pentecost, that turning point in the lives of my disciples. I urge you to contemplate this, to come to understand how it is that this great blessing came upon them. Without this event, it is unlikely that many of my disciples would have accomplished the works that they did. For that very moment changed them, that gift and blessing befell them in response to their earnest prayers. In truth, those years that I spent with them were merely preparation for what was to come. The promise was fulfilled, the gift, the mighty onrush of God's Love was given in those moments as my disciples huddled together in prayer and earnestness and wonderment. You are my disciples, those of you who take the Truth of God's Love to your hearts and minds and souls and seek for the transformation that comes with this gift.

You may also receive what is called the Pentecost, the great onrush of God's Love which shakes you to the core, that opens you wide to the inflowing of this gift. His Love pouring into you, piercing you, making the great change within, the change that shall bring all insights and understanding, the awakening of the soul in love. This is available to all who are earnest in their prayers, for God is earnest in his desire to bless you in this way. The question is, can you summon the intensity of this desire to truly be with God in this way, to seek the great gift with such profound faith and desire that you may truly be blessed with the fires of love, that you may be changed irrevocably by the power of love, that God's Hand may be upon you in such a way that all else that is contrary to love may be dissolved in the fire, that you may be reborn in love.

You are my disciples, beloveds, and you have my commitment and loyalty as God's channel of Love. I am the example and I am the way towards truth and light, and I envelop you in love. Beloved souls, may your souls open wide, and the great onrush of God's Love through his Holy Spirit touch you deeply, uphold you in light, transform you in this touch, this miracle of God, the sweet nectar of his soul pouring into you, that you may know its flavor, its wonderment, and feel the joy of a soul claimed by God, knowing beyond doubt that you are truly his child. Be with God, our Creator, our Heavenly Father, the source of all love. May we be with him now, and that the Pentecost may be ours together, that it may not just touch us once, but many times, on the journey towards atonement.

We seek this gift. We are together in the truth of God's Love, and we shall be forevermore. God bless you, beloveds. Dear gentle sweet souls of God, know this love from every part of your being. Feel its touch in every cell, in every thought, in every way that you are that God has created you. Know the power and the gentleness, the sweetness and the flame that shall truly uphold you and uplift you, making you a new person, a soul redeemed in the Truth of Love. We pray together, you and the angels of heaven, and many spirits, we pray together for this gift. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus, and I love you. God loves you beyond measure. Feel this Love in all its glory, and you shall be redeemed in the power of His Essence. God bless you.
