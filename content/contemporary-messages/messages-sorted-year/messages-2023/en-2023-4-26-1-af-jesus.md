# 10 th Anniversary DLSF Acknowledgement

April 26<sup>th</sup>, 2023

10th Anniversary DLSF, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to acknowledge your work. As you continue to bring the Truth of God’s Love into the world, so each of you are blessed. And, yes, you acknowledge these two beautiful souls and their dedication. But in truth, they merely reflect your own dedications, your own intentions of doing God’s work, of bringing the Truth of God’s Love to the world. So we work together, all of us in the Celestial Kingdom, in the bright Spheres of spirit and those of you upon the Earth plane. We are all involved and dedicated in this work and will continue to do so in accordance to your desire and your efforts.

What these two beautiful souls have accomplished is not the culmination of this work, rather, it only marks the beginning of a wider scope, a greater effort that is to be made in the world. For the world desperately needs this truth, desperately needs to understand their own souls and the purpose of their life. They can only do so by going to God and finding the answers there. So as you continually point to the source of all truth and all love, as you continually speak of this effort to love and to express your love in the world, so you are doing God’s work, so you are doing my work. So we are all in unity and the power of this unity shall in time save the world from the darkness that is its present condition.

You are all part of God’s plan for the salvation of humanity. Each of you feel the pull. Each of you understand and come to know the inspiration that has touched your soul and has come forth into your consciousness, and thus, it inspires and directs your efforts. My beloveds, each of you are gifted. Each of you have much to give to the world and I encourage you to step forward and be that light, be that channel of love. Express your true and God given self in the world. In this way, you shall be God’s instruments. All of you and many more shall be God’s lights in the world and be those channels that are so needed.

I give you my love. I acknowledge these two beautiful souls. I acknowledge all of your work and all of your efforts and I encourage you to continue, and to also question with your prayers and within your soul, what you may do, what more may manifest as channels of God’s Love, as bringers of light and truth. It is important that you grow and feel the power of God’s Love manifesting through you, for this is truly the way the world may change and the world may be healed. Not because you as an individual with a particular plan or idea will change the world but rather, collectively, as God’s instruments being guided by His Hand will come together and be that force of change, that force of light, that force of truth that will impress upon your brothers and sisters, who in turn will impress upon others until the world has been lit in light.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom, and I come to you in support and love, to acknowledge you, to be with you. For you are the hope of the world, you are the lights of God’s Truth and Love. Shine bright, my beloved and beautiful friends, disciples, instruments of God. Shine bright in the world and so you will be blessed. God bless you. God bless you all. My love is with you.
