# Body and Soul Health

December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, Care. My dear ones, you who have set aside this time for your souls, for the welfare of that which shall live on, I thank you. I come often to join you and I have been asked to speak this evening in the midst of a congregation which is Celestial. It is important to consider the larger import of  Jesus’ words that went something like this: *“It is not what goes into one that defiles them, into one’s mouth, but what comes out”.* For, what comes out in unconsciousness, in inharmony can be detrimental, can hurt others and yet what goes in one’s soul affects what comes out of one’s mouth and one’s very being. So, as is said, *‘Food for the soul’* is always worthy of partaking and the Divine Love is food for the soul. 

What you take in your physical body, though it may not affect your soul, is also worthy to consider as long as you walk the earth. Do you want food that is life-giving, balanced, harmonious, healthy? Or do you prefer what is sometimes referred to as *‘comfort food’.* I know I often did when I was troubled. And though this food gave me momentary comfort, it sometimes wreaked havoc on my physical body and that can affect one’s prayer time. For, if you’re dealing with illness or bodily upheavals, you can become very distracted and feel very out of harmony physically. 
  
So, in a sense, how you take care of yourself in the natural world, can affect your prayer life, and your prayer life is the foundation of the transformation of your souls. There has been a lot said about being in nature, finding a place of peace and calm and I took my family often to what I called God’s church, the beautiful cathedral of trees and lakes and streams and we found as a family, camping out often or sometimes going on a weekend or on time off, to be not only invigorating, but calming and healing. 
   
I know many here in this group are very aware of their relationship to Mother Earth and the natural world, and healthy habits. But this message goes beyond this circle, that all may consider their habits, their preferences, and why they make certain choices. My beloved Jimbeau told me when I met him that he was a Hindu, that he preferred Sattvic food, which is balanced and harmonious, as opposed to Rajasic food which is spicy and sometimes over-energetic or Tamasic food which is just essentially dead food. There are qualities in each one of these of course which can be beneficial depending on the condition of one’s physical body, but as a general rule, foods that are balanced, healthy, alive, life-giving, neither too spicy nor too bland, help the body to be at ease, to be healthy, to not be distracted. 
  
So my dear Jimbeau is wondering why I am talking about this tonight as it seems to be very focused on food and the body and it is. But really my subject is, if the body is in harmony, if the environment beautiful and in nature and peaceful, if the music is beautiful and harmonious, then you are in a church wherever you may be, and that allows one the calm and peace to go to God completely without distraction, to be in one’s soul as you are here in this circle. And lastly, I say to you, as it is important to focus on the longings of your souls when you come in prayer, in your daily lives if you stay in harmony and not veer off to extremes, whatever they might be, this will help your prayer life. 
    
I thank you for this time and I hope these words have been helpful and will continue to be helpful to those on earth and I say to you all, there will come a time when you will be free of all those concerns, free to be in the light and love of the Creator, in your destiny in the celestial heavens. So, I step back and join you in this prayer for the love of God. May we all be filled and changed in His love. 
   
May God bless us. I am Care
