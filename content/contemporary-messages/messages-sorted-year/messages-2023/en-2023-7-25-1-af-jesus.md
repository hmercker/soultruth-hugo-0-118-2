# Pays Tribute to Al and All of Us on His 70th Birthday

July 25<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

My beloveds, I am your brother and friend Jesus. I come to acknowledge my brother, to acknowledge his efforts, to acknowledge the truth that he carries each and every day into his life. I have known this child from his very beginnings. I have observed him, I have prayed for him and I have come to know him as a true brother. So, I made my choice to have him as my spokesperson at this time on Earth. Because upon my observations, upon the tests, challenges that he overcame, and the desires within his soul, all these things came into alignment so that I may use him as my instrument. So, I have and shall do so.

It is not that this child has great and unique gifts that are beyond what others have and can express. Each of you have within you the potential to be a powerful and beautiful channel in the world. Each of you is gifted by God with great soul capacities and faculties. It is the choices that you make each and every day that determine the road that you will take. God lays before you the high road. God says, “I will provide for you all the ways and means that you may travel this road, that you may be of great service to humanity, that you may be a great light in the world. Yet, it is dependent upon you and your choices, your attitudes, your desires. My beautiful brother chose well and I believe I chose well in having him as my instrument to speak through.

Through the ages, now that this great truth has been well established upon the Earth, there will be others who will speak, others who will take up the mantle. Others who will have grown and come to that place that they are worthy and that they are capable. So, my son has accomplished much. He is well known to all of you and here you come to honour him. So I honour him and you, my beloveds. For each of you have overcome the barriers and pitfalls that would hold you from God. Each of you desire to be in alignment with God, to be in harmony with God’s Laws of Love, to receive His highest of gifts, the Essence of His Soul entering your soul through the Holy Spirit. This makes you a light. It makes you a beautiful and extraordinary soul.

In this, do not underestimate the possibilities where God may use you as His channels and instruments in the world. We are all in one great family of truth. We all aspire for harmony and light. We all aspire within our souls to be transformed by God’s Love. So, each plays his part. As each grows in love, their capacities to be a channel, a beautiful light will grow as well.

Many of you acknowledge and admire this instrument. Yet is he so different from you? Has he been gifted with extraordinary faculties of the soul and gifts of the body? No, my beloveds, he is merely a man as I was a man who walked the Earth. Yet he saw the potential, the possibility of being an instrument, a light in the world. My fervent hope is that each of you will come to this conclusion, will come to accept the possibilities, the gifts and what God has given you to be a beautiful channel in your own right. You are blessed, beloved souls, to know the highest of truths, the power of God’s Love to transform and heal, to ignite the many gifts within you.

May we all be unified in our deep desire, our mutual efforts, the oneness of being God’s instruments in the world. I am close to each one of you. I know you well. I know you as well as this dear son whom I love so much, and I love you all, beloveds. God loves you all. Feel and know this love, accept it into your hearts and be truly blessed by the Hand of God.

May God bless you and uphold you, beloved souls. His plan for you is great. May you come to know it and express it. For therein lies the source of great joy and fulfilment. My beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, we gather to acknowledge the power, beauty and wonderment of God’s gift of Love. So, we are His children in that love. May God bless you and keep you in His Light, carrying you through all the challenges of material life and awaken you to all of the wonderment of His great Soul and universe. We are His children and may we acknowledge the power and glory of God’s touch upon us. My love is with you all. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you.
