It is I, Care. 
   
God’s love is the great transformer of the soul. The image of the metamorphosis of the caterpillar into the butterfly is often used as a spiritual metaphor for change, for freedom and this is quite accurate. But in the depths of this message is the realization that what was once a caterpillar has become in the chrysalis of change a completely new creature with wings. Never going back to its earth-bound state. Such is your destiny in the love of God. 
  
There is much suffering in the world and suffering brings with it many gifts, for when one perseveres, one grows. Even Job through all of his suffering and all his trials was told by the angels, *“God will put laughter in your mouth and on your lips joy with a in song in your heart, so have faith and persevere.”* And he did. 
   
There is great change upon the world at this time and you are all very much aware that things are changing and, in your hearts, and in your souls, you have wished for this change from an unsustainable condition, from war and negativity, from inequality to a more loving, sustainable, compassionate, safe world. In earth time, as rapid as it may seem, one must allow the tides to turn, the seasons to change and so as you move from a season of doubt into one of faith and trust, you must rely on your prayers and as you had discussed earlier;<sup>1</sup> remembering God throughout your day, remembering the prayer circles, even becoming your own prayer circle. 

This we encourage and this we remind you of as you grow in prayer and in the love of God. For your service becomes a reminder to others to go to God, to be in grace, to rise above suffering and allow change that you may be free and as Job found out, laughter does come, and laughter is the divine medicine. Charlie<sup>2</sup> once told me that he would tell people that a day without laughter is worthless and so he in his journey remembered laughter and wished to bring it to every soul and how he succeeded with a smile at the end of the day. He told me also that sometimes when he was very troubled, he would remember to smile through it because even the very act of smiling changed the chemistry and bestowed a blessing upon the recipient. And so of course you know his song *“smile though your heart is breaking”,* great wisdom. 
    
So, I leave you with that thought and a wish that in this beautiful circle of my beloved and all you dear, dear souls a wish for transformation, a wish for the love of God to infill you that you may be in grace, that laughter is restore and that the world be blessed for as you change, so does the world. With all my love and blessings, I join you now. I am your sister in Christ and your friend on the path of divine love, I am Care. God bless you.
