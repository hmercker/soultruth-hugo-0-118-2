# Encourages us in the World

I am Yogananda. Many in your world are dissatisfied and isolated. They seek distraction in many ways. They peer into their little boxes for some semblance of comfort. They walk in the world asleep, blinded, without true purpose, other than material gratification. They know not where they go. They know not the true journey of life. But here they exist upon a material plane and think not of their future or their purpose, rather, the day-to-day stimuli of a world filled with so much that is irrelevant to feeding the soul. 

For you to garner their attention, my beloved friends, you must be strong in your voice, clear in your intention, your words and your actions. This comes as you know your own soul, you are clear of your journey, and where you are going in your life. Without this clarity within you, how can you teach another? Seek to be wise in your counsel. Seek to be pure in your heart. Seek to be an example of love. As your soul fills with the greatest and highest of Love, may that expression light all that you do and all that you are. 

It is important, if you are to be a leader, to know the truth that you speak of, not just in your mind, but in all that you are and all that you express in the world. In this way, you cannot trip and be vulnerable to those who would criticise you. For with the dedication of a soul attuned to God and well aware of the truth, no human comment or judgment has any value to you. It is all within the realm of God where you must live and seek the truth that your validation will lie, and your joy will come. 

Be with God. Be with the truth and be true to yourself. This way you will be well equipped to enter and venture into the world and be that teacher, healer, and voice that you so desire to be. I ventured forth fearful, but with faith. I did not know what lie ahead when I stepped upon the shores of this continent. Yet, what a wondrous journey it was, how many came to me and sought the truth, and indeed, saw me as a leader of truth? You can be what I was merely by conviction, faith and commitment to your guidance, and you will find your way. Maybe not as I found my way, but there are many ways that God expresses His Will through humanity and yours will be unique as was mine. Indeed, that step forward, however much trepidation you may feel, is important and necessary. For one step follows another until the journey is complete, and you will find your way upon a marvelous path of service and light. 

May Godâ€™s Love be that which empowers you, awakens you and guides you. May you be blessed in many ways so that you will have that which you require to express the Will of God through you. May God bless you. I am Yogananda. My love is with you all. Indeed, you are growing lights with much potential and much purpose. God bless you. God bless you.
