# There are Many Kinds of Healings

I come. I am your brother in Christ, Luke. The world is in great need of a healing. So much trauma. So many inharmonies, untruths have created much fear, loss of faith, doubt, and despair. So many have a sense of hopelessness and fatalism. So many unable to see a life beyond in a world with so much information and yet, so little understanding. 

Those of us here who do healing work, we wish to honor you this evening. For there are many kinds of healing and there is much that may be required. This is not only true on the earth plane but in spirit. So many souls coming over, victims of violence, famine, war, and abuse. These souls go to a place not unlike a hospital where, over time, they begin to heal, some from very deep trauma. There are many spirits assigned to this. These healing spirits also assist healers on the earth as many of you are well aware of. It is said that one must be open to receive a healing in order for the healing to occur and while this is true, when you pray for someone’s healing, you draw those healing angels and spirits to that person, who then try to influence them to be open. So, I wish you to know, there is great efficacy in your healing prayers, your healing thoughts. There is not only the necessity for physical healing, mental healing, emotional healing, but also healing those wounded by erroneous dogma, teachings that are often out of harmony, in error, and these souls, when they come over, are often more challenging for us to have them open their hearts, open their minds to the great truths. 

The world needs a healing on many levels from a broad spectrum of ills, thus we continue to encourage you to not only provide physical healing services, emotional healing services, soul healing services, but also the truths, because many are wounded from what is in error and the truth will not only set you free but will heal a wounded soul. Just as so many aspire to material wealth and find out ultimately that that currency has little or no value, it is also a great work to educate and inform these souls not only on earth but in the spirit world on the great love of God, the great gift, the eternal currency and flow of grace that is theirs for the asking; and one must ask. Ask from your souls and it will be given. Allow your minds a rest in the great blessing of God’s love ever available to all those longing souls who ask. There is much light in this circle and much love, such beautiful souls. You have drawn me to speak and I thank you for this. I shall step back to be with you in the asking forevermore of God’s love to be in all our souls. I am your brother and friend and I love you. God loves you. Go in peace. I am Luke.
