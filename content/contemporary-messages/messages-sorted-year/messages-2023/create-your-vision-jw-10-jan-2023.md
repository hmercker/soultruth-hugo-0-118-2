# Create your Vision

January 10<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tenn, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



I am here Claire, your sister in Christ. I come as promised and I come with a promise, to always be with you whenever you should need me. I have no agenda to promote, no mindful exposition. Whenever one on Earth can visualize what they wish to make manifest, that thing, object, or actuality and engagement can become real. When this is done from the soul in prayer, to be in God’s grace, in His will, then we give our full support. What I am saying is, when your vision is true and your intent is sacred, the object of your desire becomes a reality, a blessed reality. We talk about guidance and each one must follow their own. Each one brings their gifts to the feast at the Father’s table and at this table, all are one in His love; What we call holy communion in the real meaning of those words. 

May God’s holy spirit bring His love into each of your souls and may that awakening bring you the gifts or rather I shall say the discovery of your gifts that God has given you. May each one of you grow in the love of God. Create your vision in these days on Earth that all may be blessed. For your community, for your children, for your friends in God and His plan. We shall walk this path together. Call and I shall come. And I bring the many. Ask and you shall receive from the Father, who loves us all. Bless each other. May every door open for you. May every divine dream come true. May every healing be yours. Every gift be given. Every truth be realized in the love of God. Go in peace. With all my love, I am your sister in Christ, your friend on this path. I am Claire. God bess you.
