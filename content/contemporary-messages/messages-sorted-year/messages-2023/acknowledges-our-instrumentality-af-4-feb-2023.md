God bless you, my beloved friends, I am Andrew. You see, even what you consider to be a vacation, there are opportunities made available to you to do God’s work. For everyday is an opportunity. Indeed no day can be wasted and ignored as an opportunity to do God’s work. Today, my dear daughter, you spoke to those who were curious about your path. Indeed, you planted seeds and we were with you as you spoke. Our beloved daughter, who reaches out to many souls with her humour and her love and her curiosity about others, we use you as well to connect, to bring light to others. 

This instrument walks as a channel of light and love in the world. Though he is quiet, he is powerful in the light and this too is an influence. This too can be utilised to bless others and plant seeds. You see, each of you carries your instrumentality with you wherever you may go and God will open doors to allow you to speak, to heal, to comfort, to laugh with another and uplift. All of these things are of God and you will find that many more opportunities to serve God will be with you in the days to come. 

May God bless you, beloved souls, this little triangle of love, of light, of joy. And so, you shall see how God opens many doors and awakens many possibilities as you enter your day and live it in love and joy. God bless you. I am Andrew and I love you, beautiful friends, beloved children of God. God bless you. God bless you.
