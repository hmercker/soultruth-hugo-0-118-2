Surprises coming. I am Goldie. Life is one big surprise, is it not? When you are in alignment with God, God brings you many surprises, many blessings and many gifts. Be open to this with every day, for every day will bring its surprise, its gift, its blessing. Be joyful and acknowledge the beautiful gift which is life, the beautiful blessing which is Godâ€™s Love for you, the beautiful soul that you have that continues to brighten and awaken in love. God bless you, beloveds. Goldie loves you. God bless you.
