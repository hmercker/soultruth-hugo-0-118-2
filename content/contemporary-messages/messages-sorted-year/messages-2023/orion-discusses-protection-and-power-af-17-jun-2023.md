May God’s Essence continue to flow into your souls. My beloved friends, I am Orion and I have little to say today to you other than to repeat instructions that have been given, to encourage you to be calm, to put aside the worries and cares of your daily life, to be at peace and to allow us to be close. For it is in this rapport of angels and men, of bright spirits and all that is good, the Touch of God comes to uplift you and keep you in the light. Dark forces will always try to distract you, to challenge you, to keep you from that place of light. For when you are surrounded in bright light, you become a target for the darkness. For how many in your world carry such a light? Many are immersed in the darkness or semi-light of a life lived upon your Earthly plane, it is only those who challenge this and walk away from those conditions that are difficult and distracting and unnerving. Yet, they exist, and you are well aware of their existence. 

Your choice is important, my beloved friends, to stay in the light, to live in the light, to be an expression of light. For is this not how the world changes? It changes by those who make that choice for light, who are consciously aware of that choice and how important it is to exert that choice towards light. There are many who proclaim that they are wise and have much to give to the world. Yet we, who have the insight and vision, do not see great light around them, rather the effects of ambition, desire for power, desire for recognition, and the desire to be loved. Even those who may manifest various things that are of the metaphysical nature are not necessarily great and bright lights. Some are, of course, but some are not. They have come to utilise the powers of the mechanics of the universe in order to manifest various unusual things so that others may recognize them as a guru or some teacher. 

I say to you, beloved and beautiful friends, are their souls shining in light? Are they truly of light? What are their inner thoughts and inner inclinations and ambitions? This is why you are tested so thoroughly. For you cannot be vulnerable to the wild ambitions of humanity and those conditions that bring a sense of importance and power and control. Rather, go humbly to God as a child. Exercise your faith. Be in the light and know that all these things that come to you are from God. 
 
So, you see, as a mere mortal upon the Earthly plane, what you are capable of has its limitations because of the conditions in which you live. Yet, when you are in alignment with God, those limitations disappear or dissolve readily as the light increases around you as the Essence of God’s great Soul builds within you. This is why we make great effort to encourage and to uplift and to bring about a conducive environment so that you may grow in light. We are not teaching you how to be powerful, how to draw those to you by ways of the mind and the intellect and the personality. We wish to draw souls to you by the light which is far more subtle and elusive to you on this material plane.

You are learning and you are seeing the effects of your efforts and the way in which you may wield the light in the world, not with power and deep intention to force others towards you. Rather, it is humility and gentleness and love as you draw your brothers and sisters close. May you be free from judgment, free from those human inclinations of which I speak, free from all those things that you, within your minds, believe are valid approaches and capacities within you. Because this is how you were taught and what you were taught. What we are presenting to you is something completely different, of radical change of perspective and direction. So, you must unlearn those human things and learn about your own soul and the capacities therein that are transforming from human to Divine. 

May you come clearly to see this transformation, to walk in the light without the distractions, worries and cares, to be at peace and to know the Will of God. In this way, you will walk the road that God has laid before you. And you will do so without trepidation, ambivalence, fear and judgement, rather faith and joy, clarity and light, knowing that this is the road you must walk. This is the road not only to your own salvation, but the road to service and light. The further along you get on this road, my beloved friends, the easier it becomes. It is a simple road. It becomes simplified by the awareness that you build within your soul, the understanding that comes from there so that the distractions of the mind become less and the knowings of the soul come forward. May God bless you, my friends, in the great light of God’s Love keep you in that love, hold you in that love and light and where you are at rest, at peace and with the depths of knowing, bring to you wisdom, gentleness, expansiveness and love. God bless you. I am Orion and I love you, dear and beloved brothers and sisters, cohorts in a great adventure of service and truth. God bless you.
