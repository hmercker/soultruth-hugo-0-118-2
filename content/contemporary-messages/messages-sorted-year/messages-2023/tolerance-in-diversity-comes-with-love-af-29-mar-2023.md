I’m your teacher, Augustine. I see before me a tableau of many different faces, many unique souls. Each soul approaches these truths from their own perspective, their own way of practicing and coming to a realisation of these truths so they may be integrated into their consciousness. Yes, each soul is unique. Each soul carries its own perspective, their own ideas as to what is true. Yet each of you has come together in this circle to honor a dear and beautiful soul who has passed into spirit.<sup>1</sup> What is it that has drawn you together? Is it love for this dear soul? Certainly, this is the case. Also, there is something deeper within you that draws you close, that is within your soul a longing, a desire for connection, communion, fellowship, to be loved.

So you come together, and for some of you, it requires that you put aside certain ideas and beliefs. For others there is a rather strict formulation of ideas and beliefs that have the possibility of making a barrier between you and another in this circle. Indeed, each of you has come in tolerance and love, putting aside any differences in ideas, coming to realise that the power of love will heal all differences, and that with the power of love comes the possibility of seeing one another truly, as a soul who is of light and who seeks love and seeks to give love. What else matters, my friends, than this, to be a soul of love, a personage who is willing to be a shining light, an example of love?.
 
Each of you in your own way do this. Each of you, as you are well aware, are upon a journey to strengthen your light, to strengthen the love within you. So you meet together in this loving circle and you seek to be in harmony, connected in unison in a simple prayer that says: *“Dear and beloved God, we wish to receive the gift of Your Love.”* How can anyone refute this simple prayer? It is the most powerful prayer that can be presented. Yet is it not so very simple and plain to understand. That indeed there is a blessing, a power, a force in the universe that is what we call Divine Love and this blessing, this gift may be given to each of you as you seek it out, as you ask for it. Now, if you do not believe that prayer can do this, then I wonder why you would be here together. For is this not a circle of prayer?

Be true to the longings of your heart and soul. All thoughts and ideas, structures and paradigms are not relevant when you come together in this way and seek the nourishment of your soul. The mind has little to do with this. It is the power and the yearnings that come from deep within which need to be listened to and acknowledged. That too, is a simple process and does not require doctrine and dogma. It is merely a fact that every soul upon your world longs for love. What is offered by God is the highest Love, the greatest gift that is His Essence expressed and transferred from His Soul to yours. Are you willing to receive this gift? Are you happy to have this gift? Can you truly acknowledge it and in so in acknowledging it, you have accepted a gift that will last forever. It shall grow and accumulate the more you are willing to receive it and ask for it. It is a simple truth, and it is the most powerful truth in the universe. For what holds the universe together? It is love. The power of love is what is the glue that binds the universe and brings harmony to it.

Walk in the light of this truth, my friends. Seek its blessing. All else, all that you seek, all truth that you long for, all happiness and joy that is your birthright will be given to you with one simple prayer, one sure longing within you. May you know the simplicity of truth, my friends. May you see beyond the veil of your mind’s reckonings and imaginings and go to your soul where truth abides and light reigns, where wisdom may grow, compassion and love its expression, its talisman. Beloved and beautiful souls, you are given a gift. You are deeply blessed. So, may you acknowledge and cherish what has been given this night. May God bless you. I am your teacher, Augustine and my love surely is with you all. I respect and acknowledge your journeys and I come to help you along the way. God bless you. God bless you all. My love is with you, precious souls. God bless you.
