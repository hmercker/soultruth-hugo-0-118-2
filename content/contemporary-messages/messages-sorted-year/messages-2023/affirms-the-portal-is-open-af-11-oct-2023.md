Laurelville, PA, U.S.A. (Pre Retreat)

Received by Al Fike  

I am Keea-Atta-kem and I wish to acknowledge you as well in this Holy time, as you commune with God. I am here with you as are many, many angels who come on the portal, what God has opened for the benefit of all. 


# This Gathering Will Change Your Perspectives and Motivations to Carry You Forward 

Spirit:		Matthew
 
Much has come, my beloveds, for each of you. This time of gathering will change many, will change your perspective, your motivations, your ideas. All that carries you forward will now reflect the great blessing that is to come for each of you. I am Matthew. My love for each of you is great.

# You Will Fly on the Breath of God to Awaken Many Souls 

Spirit:		Confucius
 
Oh, little birds, how your plumage grows, strengthens and colours. Touched by the Divine, so that you may soar into the Heavens and touch God more closely. You may sing your songs of truth to your brothers and sisters with such clarity and beauty that they cannot help but listen and feel moved by your song. How beautiful God has made you, your souls fluttering in the light of Godâ€™s Touch, awakening and changing as His Love flows.

For each of you, there is a deep blessing, a deep purpose, a great journey ahead. So you may fly, my beloveds. Fly on the Breath of God so that He may awaken many souls to the truth of His Love, in all its glory, in the depth of His blessing and Touch upon them. So you are the harbingers. You take flight as God guides you so. 

God bless you, beloved souls. Children of truth, desiring to serve, to bring peace to the world, light and love. How the world needs you and many more like you, beloveds. So you will find the souls who are seeking to serve. You will find and make contact with many who are eager to fly with you to the Heavens. To the Heavens, beloveds, we will go. God bless you.
