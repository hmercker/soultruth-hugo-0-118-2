Jesus received by Al Fike

I am here, my beloved brothers and sisters, for I am your brother and friend, I am Jesus. I acknowledge your efforts to bring light into the world, to build light within yourself. Through your prayers, you are receiving the great gift of God’s Love. As you do so, so you build light around yourself, light that pushes back the darkness, light that nurtures not only your own person, but all that which is around you.

My beloved brothers and sisters, we are on a mission together to create light in the world to help push back the darkness, to help uplift and uphold the true nature of humanity, which is that of the soul upon the eternal journey towards God. Keep in mind that this is the journey. It is not all that the material life encompasses and asks of you, for this life that you have on the earthly plane is merely a stepping stone to greater life. Do not make the material needs and desires your priority, your focus. Rather, make the needs and desires of your soul the impetus and the choice that you make in your daily life. For as you feed your soul, so all else is fed.

As you grow in light, so all that is you will be of light. For the great Love of God transforms and heals and brings light. Be in the light always, beloved souls. Despite all that is contradictory to this, all that pulls you away, all that is of the human condition, seek the light and be the light. As you do so, know that we will be close. The angels of Heaven will surround you and uplift you and uphold you. We will protect you. We will inspire you. We will do all that we can to ensure that you sustain the light and that you grow in light.

Seek for the highest and allow the Truths of God to infiltrate your consciousness, and that you may live by them and truly be a part of God’s children who are in alignment with His Truths, His Laws of Love. Allow the joy of your soul to infect all parts of your being, all that you do, all that you are, for it is in this joyful condition of love that light is sustained and reinforced. Be true to yourselves, beloveds. Be true to what you know is true, what you know is in alignment with God and all that God has created. For, as you make that choice with each breath, as you act upon that choice with each moment, so you sustain the light.

Be of service to others. Seek to uphold and uplift your brothers and sisters. For when you touch another soul with light and love, they find comfort and relief from their pain and their misfortunes. For when love is expressed, then light is given, and where light is given, then there is hope, there is the outcomes, the expressions of being a channel of light in the world where many may benefit from your light and your efforts.

Speak the truth. Speak the Truth of God’s Love, so that the world may know the ways and means of obtaining greater light and for the soul to be transformed in light. This truth is the highest truth in the universe, and it is given freely to all who are willing to absorb and embrace this truth and to live by it. God has opened the door to His Love for all to seek it, for all to receive it. You must give this truth to your brothers and sisters in whatever way that they may accept, that they may understand what this is. For if the world is to be transformed into light, that the darkness be dispersed, then the Truth and power of God’s Love must be known, the way in which this healing of the world may be accomplished.

Walk in the world with an awakened consciousness. For when you are awake, when you truly know yourself and know your soul and know your relationship with God, then you can bring light always to yourself and through yourself to others. Be at peace, beloveds. For it is the individual who walks in peace, who is an expression of peace, that the stillness of God surrounds them, that others will find comfort, will know that indeed the light and the truth of light and love is manifest in peace, in joy, in love. Be God’s instruments in the world. For how else will light proliferate, and for those brave souls who are willing and dedicated to bring light, in whatever way, in whatever fashion is in harmony with their true selves and their gifts and abilities in the world? When love touches all parts, all aspects of your being, then there is harmony, and there is peace. Seek to bring harmony to your brothers and sisters. The expression of your life may be a harmonious, beautiful flow of light, love, truth, wisdom, the many spiritual qualities that you possess and are seeking expression. Be that being, beloved souls, that being of love and light that shall bring harmony and peace.

Know and love God with all your heart and soul. Know God consciously. Be prayerful, seek God in prayer and contemplation, utilising the faculties of your spirit and soul and mind in alignment with the desire of your soul to be with God. In this way, all insight and experience and knowing will come to you as you pray to be with your Creator, our Heavenly Father who loves you so.

My beloveds, these things that I ask of you, these things that are important are not difficult to express and to embrace. For your soul knows these truths, your soul understands God’s beckoning forth of your dedications and your connection with Him. Acknowledge this and truly be His child in the Light of His Love and the Light of His Truth, and all else shall come to you, my beloveds. It is the law, and it shall unfold and be enacted in accordance to your willingness to accept and embrace all that is part of His Love and the gift that He gives to you that is His Essence flowing into your souls. As you embrace and accept, so the manifestation of light is present and shall intensify and grow in leaps and bounds as you become His true child, as you accept this highest of truths into your life. It is simple. It only requires your efforts and dedications.

May you focus upon the simple truth and test and apply it into your life. In this way, you will prove to yourself its veracity, its validity and you will know how powerful, how truly substantial is this gift and how beautiful will be your light in the world. May you be blessed, beloved souls, blessed with the gift that is above all gifts, awakened by this gift, transformed by this gift, that you may truly come alive, the rebirth of the soul in the truth of love. May God bless you. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus, and I truly love you, each one. You are my friend, you are my brother, you are my sister, in the Love of God, in the great Truth of God, in the great Light of God. God bless you. I am close always and forevermore. I love you. God bless you.
