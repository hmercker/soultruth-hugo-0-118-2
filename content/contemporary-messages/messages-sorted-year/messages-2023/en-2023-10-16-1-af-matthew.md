# Encourages Us to Create More Circles of Light in the World

October 16<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Laurelville Collection, Laurelville, PA, USA

Matthew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Matthew. Circles of Light. This is what is needed in your world, circles such as this. Where brothers and sisters may come together and pray, be accepted, be embraced though they may have different cultures, different backgrounds, different ideas. Provided each one seeks the Love of God, then are they not welcomed in a Circle of Light? They are, indeed, by we in the spirit world, by the Celestial Angels, by God.

When these Circles are created, I would suggest that you accept all who may want to come, who desire to pray with you. If they are not cognisant of the truth of God’s Love, you may teach them. When they come to a Circle such as this, it is our hope that they will feel and experience the touch of the Holy Spirit upon their souls. Circles of Light will bring greater light to your world. The more there are circles of light dispersed around your world, the greater will be the influence, the power, the blessings, the light that will come to your world.

You are all blessed souls who carry the seeds of truth within you. These seeds must be disbursed. The truth must be disseminated. The awakening must come to your world, for your world continues to suffer. Like all of you, we do not wish to see the suffering continue. God does not wish to see the suffering continue. God wishes for harmony for all. He created the universe so that it may seek harmony. He created you so that you may seek harmony with God, with your souls in alignment with God’s Soul.

Though many do not understand this message, as you grow in light and love, you will be an example, a shining light, a beacon in the world. Do not hide your light, beloved souls, but carry it aloft that it may shine bright. Those you meet upon your travels, upon your journey toward light, give love, be love, accentuate love, and they will be drawn to the light. Indeed, there will come a time where they will ask you, “How is it that you are such a joyous soul? How is it that you are such a light?” You may answer them with truth and, possibly, you may invite them to a Circle of Light. God will provide the opportunities, the ways and the means to reach out to people, to your brothers and sisters. That you may proffer the invitation to them, giving them the opportunity to experience what you have experienced. Show them the way that will bring them to at-onement with God.

This is all we ask of you, my beloveds. This is all we ask. To share the truth as simply and beautifully and gracefully as you can. Do not let your brothers and sisters go hungry when, indeed, they are starving for love. So many feel unloved. So many do not understand what love truly is. So many do not know God and feel estranged from their Creator. This is not what is meant to be. This is not the world that God created. God created a world that progresses toward harmony. God created humanity to progress toward Him, to find their at-onement with Him.

So you have embarked upon this road. Yes, there have been challenges. There have been times where you have felt estranged from many because of your understanding of the truth, your understanding of your own soul. But still you persist. You will continue to persist. In place of this great change of attitude and perspective in life that has caused some to withdraw from you, the angels come close. Your guides come close. God comes close. The friendship that you have gained from your angel friends are more dear than any friends you could have on Earth. They are true. They are with you always and they love you beyond anything you could measure. Their love is so great.

Indeed, as you come closer to God, you will find the great Comforter, the One who embraces you with Love Divine. In this, you will know great comfort, great insight. You will experience many things. You will come to know many things. For God provides all to His children. God will ensure that you are not alone even though you may feel alone in the material world, as some of you do, you are not alone and never shall be.

 I encourage you to open your eyes to the world that is all around you, the love that is here, your friends, your bright spirits and angels that are here. All that is good and wonderful, wholesome and beautiful surrounds you, beloved souls. How could one be alone? How could one be lonely? You are His children and God provides for His children. Seek out the nourishment that God gives to you each and every day. Seek out the guidance that God willingly gives to you each and every day. Seek out the truth that is given and practice this truth with every breath. Seek out His Love and know the fulfilment of the soul. That which will bring you boundless joy, boundless joy.

In this way, all the troubles of this world will fall away. You will be in the light, the light of God’s grace. In this, many will be drawn to you. You will not be lonely, my friends. You will have many friends, many who look to you for comfort and truth, many who see you as a dear and beautiful soul. It is for you to stand tall in the light, to acknowledge your beautiful souls. Acknowledge your relationship to your Creator. In this way, all else will fall into place readily and harmoniously.

There is no need for suffering, beloved souls. It is of a human creation. God did not create suffering. God created the path to joy, to fulfillment, to all that you have been made to realise, to express. In this greater truth, know that you are loved. I know we say this time and time again, but we see that often you do not believe this. You do not take this in truly. You do not love yourselves truly, but you are taking steps in this direction.

So, we encourage you forward, beloved souls. We encourage you to be in the light, to know the love, to feel the love within you, and to know that you are loved. That you may love yourself wholeheartedly. In this comes fulfilment, fulfilment of the soul’s need and desire for love. Be joyful. For as you express joy, you increase the light around you and you affect those around you with light. Beloved souls, be wise. For as you walk in wisdom, you avoid many of the pitfalls of earthly life. Be prayerful. As you continue to commune with your Heavenly Father, then you are living the truth of God’s Love.

It is time to open your eyes, beloveds, to the truth, fully. To the love, fully. To the truth of God, fully. To the truth of God’s creation so that you may cast away the doubt, the fears, conditions that cause you to suffer, that cause you anguish and pain. Even when you are confronted with those around you who are in their pain, rather than join them and commiserate, you must be the light, the wisdom, the truth and show them the way.

My beautiful brothers and sisters, you have made great progress in this gathering. You have committed yourself more deeply to the journey, to service, to God’s Love, the truth of love. We commend you and we honour you. Yet, indeed, the journey, the struggle continues for each one of you in some way. So, we will be by your side. This we promise always. Do not doubt this. When you feel distressed, when life causes you great problems, know that God is there for you. Know that we are there for you and shall always be.

You must put aside the distress that originates from your minds. Go to your soul and pray and seek, even crying out for God. That momentary prayer will have its results and its blessings. Consider what has been said to you during this time, the teachings that have been given. Consider the blessings that have been given. Consider how you may implement what has been given and taught, to bring it into your life. You have been mightily blessed, beloved souls, mightily blessed.

We continue to honour you, to be with you, to work with you, to inspire you, to help you to be uplifted. To help you to grow in your souls so that you may truly be that light of which I speak, and be a bright and shining beacon in the world. This is all possible, beloved souls. You come to it. You come to the threshold. Now we urge you to walk through and see what life is like on the other side. Pulling away from those threads of error and darkness and living fully in the freedom and glory of the truth, of the light, of the love. It awaits you. We are here to help usher you through that threshold and bring you to that place so glorious. That place that you want so dearly within your soul. You will realise this and when you do, you will wonder, “Why did I hesitate? What took me so long to come to this place, this glorious place of freedom?” It is there for the taking, beloveds, always waiting, always there.

May you be blessed by the graciousness of God and His Love, knowing all the benefits and blessings therein. All the freedom of the heart and the soul awakened and glorified in the Light of God. We are with you always. We love you and shall be with you forever, beloved souls. Forever we shall take this journey together, and it will have greater and greater glories beyond measure. It will be an awakening upon awakening upon awakening. The flower continues to open one petal at a time. The glory of God’s creation revealed in all its beauty.

May you be blessed, beloveds. Blessed in the glory and truth of God. I am your friend, Matthew. I love you dearly. God bless you. God bless you, my friends.
