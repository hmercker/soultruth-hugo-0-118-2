# Blessings as Christmas and the New Year Approaches

December 19<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

The focus of your journey must be the great gift of God’s Love. I am Orion and I come, too, to pray with you and to encourage you upon the journey, what you call the Divine Path, that road that leads to greater love and truth. Without this focus, all else becomes irrelevant, even insignificant. For with the power, the influence and the effects of the Essence of God within your soul, then the gifts which we speak of,which we encourage you toward, may be awakened.

I am not telling you anything you do not already understand. I merely wish to reinforce the truth that when you are in the world, it is important that you are also in alignment with God, in alignment with light and truth. Each time you venture forward, it is a test and an opportunity to be in this condition of light. The challenges continue, but the rewards continue as well, the gifts and blessings, as you take time as you do now to be with God, to enjoy God’s Touch and blessings upon you. 

My beautiful friends, you are each a light. Though your approach to life is different, your experience in life is different, you are each a light. You carry within you the truth and the power of God’s Love. Your soul indicates this. It glows and signals to us, to the world and to many, the light that is growing and changing you. Consider this as you enter into your time of celebration the winter festivals, the acknowledgement of your dear, most precious brother and all that you are involved with and connect with, with others. 

May your light shine unimpeded, clear and bright. May love flow through you to those around you. Rather than be swept into the earthly conditions, I urge you to be in that place of light, to accept light and gather light around you and through you. Say a prayer for your brothers and sisters. Say a prayer for yourself. Honour life. Honour your brother who brought this great gift, this truth to the world. Honour one another, for you are surely the disciples of truth.

This truth carries on through the generations, through millennia and will continue to do so, provided there are those like yourself who will uphold this truth and truly be a part of the plan that God has to uplift humanity, to heal humanity, to heal this world. Another year fast approaches. More opportunities lay at your feet. Listen to God’s guidance. See before you those opportunities that are Divinely blessed and inspired. Ask that you may have your eyes open, your hearts full, your capacity to see and understand the Will of God foremost and predominant in your life. It will be a year of challenges and blessings. There are many surprises coming, my friends. You will see for yourself what God has in store for all of you, for all of humanity.

Be of good cheer, for the time of light fast approaches. The time of transformation comes. You will witness this for yourself, not only within you and in your own life, but within the world. This will be remarkable. This will draw many of us, not only from my planet, but others, to witness the great transformation that will take place, to affirm for ourselves the power of God’s Hand and Touch upon this Earth and upon the universe. 

These things come, not because you have prayed and brought it forth. For the power that you have to do so is meagre. It is because God intends to salvage this world from its state of deprivation and desecration. You will witness this and in your witnessing and in your experience and knowledge of the great Truth of Divine Love, you will help God reclaim it, reclaim the world, reclaim humanity. Your task is great. What you are asked to do is far beyond your present expectations or perceptions. But you will be guided, you will be shown the way. The way will open and open readily. You will feel joy, fulfilment and much understanding of truth as you are used as God’s instruments in the world. The blessing of what you call *“Direct Voice”* will be but one minor thing within many avenues and expressions of your soul’s gifts. You continue to pray for this and gather together in hope that it will manifest. I say to you, within the changing world and within the new world, this manifestation will be easily accomplished. 

You wait for this, I know. You long for this, I know. Any material expression of the truth holds such great sway to your mind and what you desire. Yet, the great miracle that is happening within you is within your soul. This is what you must come to know and recognise and acknowledge in every way. This will prove to you the truth that has been spoken to you many hundreds of times not only by me, but by many others. This you must come to acknowledge and readily accept as the fulfilment of truth, the realisation of God’s promise to you, the power of love within.

These things I wish for you to contemplate as you continue on your journey toward light. Have faith in this journey. Have faith in the timing of God’s plans and the expression of God’s handiwork in the world. In this you will know peace and contentment and will not be bothered by mindful expectations that continue to set goals and put pressures upon you. This is not necessary. Be free from these things so human and be immersed in the bliss, glory and wonderment of the Love of God and His presence with you.

My friends of Earth, shall we pray together and be uplifted in the light? My love is with you. Your friend, Orion, is with you in prayer. Blessings to you, always.
