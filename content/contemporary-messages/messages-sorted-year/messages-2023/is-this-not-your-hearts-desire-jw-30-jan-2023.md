It is I, Ann Rollins, your sister and friend in God’s love. I wish to give you a gentle reminder of the foundation of your community; of the trust in this communication and the messages received from all of us here, not only in the Celestials heavens but in the many mansions of the Father's Kingdom; the many spirits who have come through. Do you not trust in this transition that will come to all of you in God’s time? 

Whenever there is struggle, whenever there is crisis, God presents an opportunity to move forward and to lift up your souls and raise your hearts in this knowing, on this journey, to be changed from mortal to spirit, from human to Divine Angel. Is this not your heart’s desire? You have been given the great truths so obscure to the world; your prayers reaching the Father, your souls longing for At-One-Ment bringing the showering of Grace in the letting go of everything that is not in harmony with God’s Will.  Remember the prayer: *“Let my will be Thine”.* This is the longing that connects you to life everlasting. 

Please remember the magnificence of God’s Grace and the promise of a life beyond the struggles in the complete transformation of your souls in light, in love, in joy, in grace. The eternal gift that you have been given brings you hope, brings you faith. So, as you trust in God’s love, God puts His Love in each soul. He opens that door to Eternity and Immortality and the Celestial kingdom. Rejoice in each other. Rejoice in transition. 

The Father’s Universe is progressive, always changing, always unfolding, ever blessed. This is your destiny my dear friends.  May you be a blessing to this world so in need and may you always remember you have the support of the Celestial Kingdom, the Love of God, and the guidance of all the angels. Rejoice! God is good! 

With all my love and blessing for each one. And with the love of a mother, and a grandmother and your sister in Christ,  I thank you. I am Ann Rollins. May God bless you!
