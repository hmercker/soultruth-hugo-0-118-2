Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

God bless you, my friends. Professor Salyards, as always, by your side. I'm delighted to hear your conversation today. The enthusiasm and positivity of the thoughts that you have presented and the intentions that you have reflect the soul inspired and how that inspiration continues to bubble forth into your consciousness, my friends.

This is how God works. God starts to ignite the soul with certain ideas and inspirations that are mostly feelings, a yearning, a longing for something. Indeed, as that longing grows, as the soul continues to be infilled, so to speak, with the Will of God, the desire of God to utilise your gifts and your abilities in the world, so the tension builds within. There is a sense that something is yet to be fulfilled. In this way, you pray and ask to understand what it is that this is building within you. Where does this tension come from? Where does this desire originate? So you open yourselves in prayer, you are open to our influence, to God’s Touch upon you, to all that is of light, and in time, the answer emerges. The inspiration comes. The vision becomes clear. So you see, as a clear demonstration of the Will of God manifest in this way and in the excitement and enthusiasm that comes, that aha moment where you realise that there is something important to be addressed, there is a vision to be acknowledged and acted upon.

How this will emerge and evolve and come to be is yet to be established in regard to this particular vision. But indeed, as you share this vision, my beloved brother, you are igniting the imaginations of others. You are opening the door of ideas and possibilities. Indeed, that door is merely open a crack. Light is flowing through and so is joy. As time progresses, as you are patient and diligent and faithful, the answers will come. The individuals who are meant to be a part of this project will materialise, and all that you require will come to you in time. Patience, perseverance, prayer, faith - these things are very important. When we said to you some time ago that many things will emerge and many things will come as a surprise, is this not one of them, one of the manifestations of God’s creative Will working through His instruments? How your soul jumps with joy to be able to see, to acknowledge that yes, you can play a part in God's great and wondrous plan for the salvation of humanity, and not only you, but others.

But when the seed is planted within you and it originates there, it is often an indication that you are the one who will lead the charge, will receive more blessings and inspiration and visions that are to come that will complete the work. As the foundation is laid within you, so the infrastructure will emerge, and others will add to this until you see what you have created as God’s instruments in the world.

Beloved souls, there is much to do and there are many more inspirations to come. This is only the beginning. Indeed, how exciting is it to be a part of such a flow of dynamic and creative intentions that are related to the Will of God, that will be ignited by the Will of God, that will be empowered by the Will of God and the beauty and wonderment of His Love? The world will see and know the Truth of His Love, given through many different ways, many different avenues explored and expressed. For is not humanity diverse with so many unique personalities? So it is for you in your gifts and abilities and uniqueness, to reach out to others with what you have, to utilise the means of connection and inspiration and teaching.

Do not be afraid to express your dreams and ideas, beloveds. This is important. The beginnings of these thoughts may not be the endpoint or the realisation of what is meant to be, but it is a beginning, and all things must have a beginning. So I urge you to continue to think along the lines of inspiration and prayer and desire to serve. God will ensure that many things will come to your consciousness and many possibilities will be realised within you, through you, around you.

May God bless you, my beloved friends. I am your Professor Salyards, and I am happy, joyed to see that the light of inspiration is touching you all deeply, profoundly. This is God at work. This is your souls awakening and realising their potentials. God bless you. Much love to you, my beloved friends. Indeed, may much come to you in the many ways that God utilises to inspire His children in the world. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.
