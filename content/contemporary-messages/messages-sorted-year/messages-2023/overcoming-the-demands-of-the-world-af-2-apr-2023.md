# Overcoming the Demands of the World

May the great benediction of the Father’s Love befall each of your souls. Beautiful souls of Earth, I am Moses, and I come to encourage you and to counsel you upon your path towards God. You live upon an Earth that pulls you in many different directions, that carries you away from God often. The demands of this place are great, and to dedicate oneself to God, to the awakening of your soul, to be truly in alignment with God, is a formidable task indeed, as you live upon a world that does everything but direct you to God.

So I come to encourage you, to uphold you in your decision and your dedication to be with God and to receive the great benediction of His Love. Be consistent, be that stalwart soul that knows its own mind, its own desires for God. Do not listen to the many voices that surround you and wish to distract you. Set your time each day to be with God and be consistent with this time. Be in that place that is quiet and at peace so that you may listen to the sweet voice of God within you, His Love flowing, His peace all around you. 

God wishes for you to be with Him as often as possible in your life. Though God does not deny you a life, God wishes for there to be balance within it, that you may truly be with God, but to also be in the world, that you may know His Love and express that love in the world, that you may have a pure heart and pure intentions which reflect love. God lays before you a simple path. Indeed, it is one that is of little requirements. Yet,  indeed, it asks of you your dedication, your commitment in receiving this great gift that is His Essence into your soul. 

For many of you, when you sit down in prayer, your mind is swirling with many thoughts. It is hard for you to release those thoughts and to be in the silence of God’s Touch and communion. But this is what you must do, my beautiful brothers and sisters. This you must do to be in the quietness, the solitude that is of two, you and your Creator. For, all of us who have made an impression on the world as spiritual leaders, we have all applied ourselves to this truth of communion with God. Without knowing God’s Will, how could we proceed? Without being in the flow of God’s Love, how could we know what to do in a world?

God beseeches all of you to be leaders of light, to be His channels of light, to be instruments of love and light. This cannot happen unless you apply yourself to these truths in such a way that the power of the transformative Love of God will change you and open up those faculties within so that you may know the Will of God, and that you may act in your life, your will, in such a way that is in harmony with His Laws of Love.  These things cannot happen without serious application of this truth, to ask, to receive that great gift which is His Love. 

I beseech you, my friends, walk upon the path that God has designated for you. Listen with ears of your soul. Seek the love that empowers all within you and be truly His instruments upon the Earth. For the Earth is in great need of leadership, of those who are willing to declare the truth that God is your Creator, God wishes to have a personal relationship with all of His children, and that His Love will make this so. Many will not listen to your words, yet,  many will also take these words in as seeds within their soul that in time may bring and bear fruit.
 
It is for you to speak the truth, my friends. It is for you to declare that now is the time for humanity to turn to God, to seek God’s counsel and blessings. For when you go to the Source of all, when you seek the highest truth and blessing, there will and must be change and healing and greater harmony in your life. These things God offers to every soul, and you, beloved and beautiful souls of God, must demonstrate and express these truths in every breath of your life. In this way you become the harbinger, the bell toll, the teacher, the healer, each with a mission and purpose that God has placed before you. 

Walk the truth, beloveds, and seek the way of God, and all else will come. You will be guided, you will be shown the way and you will know the way without doubt, with clarity, direction and purpose. It is the truth that shall transform the world, and you who were willing to listen, who are willing to act and to lead, must proclaim this truth to the world. For the world is in great turmoil and transition. So, you are needed to calm the troubled waters, to speak that which needs to be spoken, to be that light that is needed so that you shall calm the troubles and bring the peace with truth and light and love.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Moses, and I come to uplift you and to speak that which is important and necessary at this time. My love is with you all, beloved souls of Earth. May you find peace in your lives, truth in your lives. May God’s mighty Hand of Love transform you and bring you into greater light. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you.
