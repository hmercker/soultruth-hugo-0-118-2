# Angels are Busy Preparing Souls Around the World for What is to Come

God bless you, beloved souls, I am Faith. The angels are working with many around the world as these energies and blessings come to the world, as God deems the world to be blessed and awakened. We in the Celestial Kingdom are very busy being with many, many souls upon your Earth, preparing them for what is to come. We urge you, my friends, to prepare yourselves for what is to come, to be vigilant within your soul, to be close to God always, to receive His Love. With every thought and every breath, may you put forth a prayer to receive the gift of His Love. For this is the great transformational agent of our Creator. It is meant for all to receive, provided they request this gift.

There are many in different religions, different parts of the world, cultures, those with very different ideas from yourself, who are being ministered to by the angels. You might think this somewhat extraordinary, that only those who walk the tried and true path may have angels with them. Yet, God has provided special dispensation for humanity so that their doors are opened and the possibilities of connection with many different souls has been given. Thus we are extremely busy ministering to many, making great efforts to inspire and uplift God’s children.

When I was on Earth, I was very involved with the Catholic church. My involvement was not always appreciated by the priests and the powers that be in that church. But I persisted. I gave to them my perspective and I garnered even a small following of souls who listened to what I had to say. I was gifted in sight and vision so I could see my angel friends. I could see each spirit that came to me. There were many spirits who came. So, in the latter part of my life, it was a guided life. It was a life of faith. It was a life of being God’s instrument in the world. 

Now my perspective was different from yours. I did not truly understand the power and the wonderment of God’s Divine Love. But when I passed into the spirit world and I asked for the truth and to be guided with the truth, it came. Our beloved brother, Jesus came to me and gave me the truth in such a powerful way that I could not doubt it. So, my journey upon the Divine Path began there. Although my soul certainly had a measure of Divine Love within it, my mind was not in alignment with these ideas. In time, as I grew in the Love, I helped to educate others such as my father-in-law, Brother Mandus, as he is called. He too came to the truth and came to understand it.

We called out to those who would come to the world healing center and teach this truth and be a part of this organization. These two dear souls answered the call and they were so very close to entering into the doors of this place to be used as God’s instruments there. But unfortunately, those in power lost faith in them and closed the doors upon them. Yet, these two beautiful souls continue to do their work and minister to others in the creative ways that they have engaged upon the earthly plane.

Just because one door is closed does not mean that all doors are closed or there aren’t other ways and means of bringing the truth to others. This story is a good story to remember, my friends. For when you go out into the world you will find the doors may and will be closed against you. Yet, continue to seek to serve, continue to be guided, continue to be on the Path Divine wholeheartedly and with great dedication. For God always finds a way. God will find a way for you, beloveds, beautiful souls who know the truth in such a clear and powerful way. 

You will be utilised by God. You are now being utilised by God. This group is being utilised by God to bring light, greater light to the world. There are many ways that you may be used, many avenues that you may follow, many possibilities that will be presented to you so that you may be God’s instruments. There is a multiplicity of ways to serve God. Some will bear fruit and others will not. Indeed, as you persist and we persist and God persists, the avenues that will work and be clear and powerful will come to be. You will walk upon those avenues and you will walk in faith, in joy and in trust.

Merely remember that you are dealing with the human condition and that humanity is very fickle, very changeable. It is the result of free will choice. So, when someone makes a choice that rejects you or turns away from you, say a prayer for them, my beloved friends. Walk on, knowing that you are still God’s instrument and that God will find another way, another means, another soul to minister to. There’s more than enough. There are many who require your ministrations. When one door is closed, another will open and so forth and so on until the last breath of your days on Earth. God will use you as His instruments and carry you and uplift you and guide you. 

Be embraced by God. Allow this embrace to be wholehearted and full of love. In this way you will be guided and shown the way. Be of good faith. Be joyful. Be true to your purpose, to your true being, which is your soul. All else will come to you in time. Indeed, my friends, the world is full of opportunities. It merely takes eyes to see, ears to hear, a soul attuned to the Will of God. You will find your way as His instruments of light and truth.

May God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Faith. My love is with you. My love is with you all. Indeed, I am close to many. As you seek to serve God, so I seek to walk with you and uphold you in this. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you deeply. I love you.
