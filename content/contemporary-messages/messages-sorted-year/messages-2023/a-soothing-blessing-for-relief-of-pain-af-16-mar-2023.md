Dear friends, I am Andrew. The world is opening up to all of you, for the world is crying out for light, comfort, love, healing, the soothing blessing of the Father’s Love upon them. So you know these things, these blessings very well, and you carry the light, the response of these blessings within your soul and within your being. Thus, you are answering their call by being a light. In this you will encounter many souls, for everywhere you walk, everywhere you are in the world, this crying out, this deafening cry is present within all those who are around you. Though they do not hear this cry for themselves or from another, it is within their souls, a deep desire to be released from their pain and their restrictions that they may be in the light and free and joyful, knowing love as only the soul can know love, being love as only the soul can be love. So you are their example, you are the testimony of the reality of God’s Love and universe, for it is in this acknowledgment, your conscious awareness, your prayers and your longings, that you are a testimony to the truth. 

You grow in faith, you grow in love, you grow in light and thus, you are a light, an expressed love, and in this expression, the blessings of God flow through you to others. Never restrict this flow, but allow it to be and expand and pour through you. For God intends for you to be the floodgates of His blessings in such a way that they are tangible and can be felt by your brothers and sisters. God needs you in this regard. Though God can pour His blessings upon many, it is through you that these blessings are more potent and tangible to the world. You are the lens by which God pours His Light and indeed, as that lens becomes more clear and refined, then the light becomes intense and powerful. Be the light, beloveds. Be the light and know that in being the light, you are fulfilling your soul’s desire for light and the expression of light.

My beloved and beautiful friends, there is so much need in the world and you are becoming aware of this. It is imperative that you listen to your guidance, listen to God’s Will through you so that you may travel and be and express yourself in conditions and situations that God may orchestrate. In this way, nothing is wasted. You do not speak to those with deaf ears, you do not minister to those who are not willing to change and long for the light, instead, you are answering prayers for all of us who are doing God’s bidding, are answering prayers, acting on behalf of God’s intention, His agents of light. So you are in training to be a clear and powerful agent of light, and you will find that great wisdom and discernment will grow within you so that how you are used and what may come through you is purely of God’s intention and Will. 

Yet, it is for you to discover your gifts, to grow in the Father’s Love, to apply yourself in prayer to receive this Love, which is as you well know, the doorway to all other gifts and blessings. Take time daily with an intensity and commitment to be in prayer with your Heavenly Father. For those of you who have very active minds, you must learn to quell this activity and go deeper within you, to pray from your soul, for this is where the answers come and the blessings flow. Continue to move towards soul consciousness and allow this to be the core of your understanding and experience in life, and those other aspects of yourself will find their rightful place, their harmonious functioning within the great body that is you.

Be at peace, beloveds, and know that you are loved. Be true to yourselves and know that in being true to your true self, you will find all the answers, and all that is meant to manifest through you will do so in good time. You each have a destiny, a purpose, and indeed you are walking towards that fulfillment of purpose and destiny. Have faith in this, beloveds. Have faith in the journey that you are taking. Have faith that God is guiding you. Have faith that all will unfold in harmony with His Will and plan. You know in your hearts whether you are within alignment with God or not, and when that feeling of being out of alignment comes to you, this is the time for intense prayer, to ask to be shown the way, to turn your direction more towards God. This will come to you in prayer. You will come to know God’s Will in prayer and thus, harmony must come in this way. 

May God bless you, my beloved friends, and may you always be in alignment with God. May you feel the joy, the sustenance that comes with the elixir of God’s Essence flowing into your souls and changing you from mortal to immortal, that you may someday enter into the Celestial Kingdom and join us all in the great glories that are there. God bless you. I am Andrew. My love is with you all. Indeed, I am close. I am close. God bless you in His Love.
