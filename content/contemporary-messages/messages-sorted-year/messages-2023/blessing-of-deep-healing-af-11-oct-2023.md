# Blessing of Deep Healing as We Travel to Laurelville

October 11<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Laurelville, PA. U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike  



I come to give you healing, each one of you, to uplift you, that you are in the best possible condition and light for this time together. For we rely upon your instrumentalities, your gifts and abilities to help uplift the larger group. We have brought you together at an earlier time so that you may be prepared. We have been working diligently to help you to be in the best possible condition. You have slept well and you will be well, my beloved and beautiful friends. 

As you greet all those who come, you will give to them an upliftment, a blessing as well. We charge you up, so to speak. As you think of your devices in this way, so you are our devices. We utilise you to store the energies and blessings for others, giving to them as you greet them with love and embrace them with love. So I urge you to be open and willing to give, to embrace, to love. 

You are blessed, my beloved friends. Indeed, you sparkle with your charges and the beauty of your souls. How lovely to see you in this condition and in this way.  This will grow as well. Much is being given. Remember this. Be open, be open and joyful. I am Mylora. God bless you. God bless you, my friends. We are working together for the good of all. I love you.
