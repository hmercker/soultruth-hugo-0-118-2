# Transmit Love

I come I am your brother in Christ, Judas. I ask you to be aware that your soul is both a transmitter and a receiver. And though you have been informed of this I wish to remind you. This receiving, this transmitting is going on whether you are waking or dreaming and therefore it is important that your soul be in harmony so that what you receive is in God’s love and light is the result being what you transmit is in this condition of Grace. I am not discounting the difficulties of staying in prayer in a world so full of choices. You encounter other souls who are often out of harmony and under the influence of lower spirits and you yourself may find that you are out of sorts, perhaps in anger, perhaps in doubt, perhaps in depression, loneliness, or fear and, if you transmit this, you will attract those spirits who are also in similar conditions. 

And so, I will give you a bit of advice here. When you find yourself in a state of inharmony try and make it your practice to go directly to God and ask for The Love. Ask any spirits who are around you to join you in prayer, in the asking, in the receiving, of the great gift of the Heavenly Father. That intention clears the air. For those who stay, there is the great possibility of a healing, of a blessing. And for those who go back to their homes in spirit, their souls now know that ahead there can be light and love. For although they have may have in the moment turned away from it, a soul is always pulled towards the love and the light. This is how it (the soul) was made, and this of course is God’s intention. It has been discussed and written about and proclaimed through many Celestial Angels as the law of attraction. It is my wish to try to make this accessible to you in human terms, in your everyday lives so that you know you can always turn to God. That you know we will always come and bring a blessing and bring protection and healing. 

You know when the Master was crucified which the world considers every year, at least the Christian world, and I had already arrived in spirt in a very dark place. And yet, the Master never stopped loving me and those who killed him, who abused him, who mocked him. Many of those, if not all, became his followers while still on earth and eventually all in spirit. Because despite their inability to resist taking orders or whatever their mindset may have been, their souls felt the love of God. The Master does not wish anyone to dwell on those events and so he would prefer we speak of the resurrection into spirit and the transformation of your soul in the love of God. This is the true "being reborn" into the glory of the Heavenly Kingdom. And so this is your destiny. How wonderful, how glorious, how blessed, your souls are in the love of God.  

For one such as I, a great sinner, to become a redeemed child of the Father, should let you know that all, from the vilest sinner to the most loving, can be transformed in the Grace of God. With all my love and blessings, I shall step back into this prayer for the Love of God. I thank you.

I am Judas once of Kerioth, now a Celestial Angel and your brother and friend in Christ. God bless you!
