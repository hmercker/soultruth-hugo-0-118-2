May God’s Love infill your soul, beloveds. I am your teacher, Augustine. Before I begin my talk, I wish to acknowledge the dear soul whom we are commemorating on her day of birth for she is a bright and beautiful soul, and she has learned much in the last few years of her endeavors to grow spiritually, and she has indeed grown bright in love and come to acknowledge the great truth of God’s Love to transform the soul. So we acknowledge her in her endeavors, in her beauty, in her grace, in the brightness of her soul.

Beloved souls, it is important that you express and truly feel compassion in the world, for it is in this expression that the Love of God may be a part of your daily experience and outpouring of love in the world. Compassion for others, compassion for yourself. For in this difficult world in which you live, you must acknowledge how you have overcome so much of the negativity and darkness that exists in your world, these conditions that surround each of you, these conditions that influence so many who are in your life, these conditions that conspire to bring you to that place of despair and pain and difficulties. They do exist, they are real, and they are powerful in their conditions, and yet you have learned to overcome that which is conspiring to bring you to a place that is not of love and light and joy. The human condition continues to dominate your world and you, beloved souls, continue to fight against this condition, to step forward in light, to choose otherwise, to choose light over darkness, to choose truth over error, to choose God over the willful and self-centeredness of humanity to be separate from their Creator. Have compassion for your struggles, beloved souls, have compassion for those conditions that you deal with each and every day that is a part of the human life.

Since you are mortals you are subject to the free-will of man, and so the free-will continues to rage upon the Earth conditions that are not of God. And it is for you to say, “I will not be a part of these conditions. I will choose otherwise. For God has given me choice, and God has given me the truth and acknowledgment of that which is of His Creation and His Truth. And so I walk the path of truth, I walk the path of love, I walk the path of self-compassion and compassion for my brothers and sisters.” Thus, you clear away these dark conditions, you choose to be a light. In this, you bring your angel friends close, you bring the Touch of God upon your soul, and you bring the transformation of this Touch within your soul through receiving His Essence, through being that true child of God. 

It is for you, beloved souls, to acknowledge the choice that you have made, the light that you have brought to you, the power of God’s Touch upon you, for in this you are contributing to the transformation and healing of your world. In this you will find the liberation and the joy that your souls seek and your minds so long for to be free of these human conditions that so trouble you, that so lay upon you at every turn. Know that God’s Love for you is the answer to all of these conditions that are heavy and that challenge you. God uplifts you in Love, God brings you to that place where there is liberation, there is peace. And so we come together do we not, beloved children of God, to acknowledge this truth and to bathe in the light of His blessings? And so we are in this light, and so we shall know the peace of His Touch, and so we shall be changed forever in the blessing of His Love.

Beloved souls, breathe deep the blessings of His Love, and allow yourself the freedom, the joy, the luxury of this light pouring upon you, absorbing every bit of this beautiful blessing for each of you, for God’s Love and compassion for you is greater than anything you could know and comprehend. It is greater than all the darkness in the world, it is greater than all conditions that are not in harmony with love. For it is the one thing that shall heal you and heal the world, the one thing that shall bring to harmony all things that are of His Creation, all things that are of the reality of God’s Creation. 

Be in harmony and be in the joy of His Touch. Have compassion and love for yourself and for all those around you for each soul longs for this, each soul that is lost and alone and has made great choices towards darkness and disharmony, in truth is longing for the healing and the liberation of their soul in light and truth and love. And so, we bring this together into the world, do we not? Into the world we are channels for His Love. We are here to acknowledge the truth of His Love. We are here to stand for His Love and all His blessings for the Earth, for every soul. We stand in unison to be His channels, to walk in the light of His Love, to be an example of this blessing, to shine forth as His children. 

May God bless you, beloved souls, in the truth of His Love, so we are a living testament to this truth and shall grow ever brighter as we receive more of His blessing and our souls are liberated in truth and love and light. 

God bless you, beloveds. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I come to pray with you in all the glory of this light and truth. I am with you, as are many who love you dearly and have great compassion for the struggles of this earthly plane of yours. We are with you, never to leave. God is with you. With every breath God’s Love shines upon you. God bless you, God bless you all, in the love and light of His Grace.
