# The Spirit Realms of Light 

December 11<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here your brother in Christ, Robert Hugh Benson. May the blessings of God be upon you. 
   
I shall reintroduce myself to this group for those that are not aware of my life and of my writings from spirit. I was the son of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Anglican Church. I became a priest in that church, and I later converted to Catholicism where I became a monsignor because I sought a very strict interpretation of the New Testament. 

I gained some notoriety as a writer on religious themes through a very, I shall say, Catholic point of view. And my writings were so biased that one who was a reader or follower of mine might well presume that this was the only Church, the only way. After I retired from being a monsignor, I became a writer of science fiction based on my religious bias and I actually achieved a greater notoriety for those writings. 

Then I passed into spirit and very quickly realized the extent of my errors of my beliefs of my preaching and my judgment through my writings. I was guided by another who was also a minister, a reverend that I knew, who showed me in all its splendor the freedom in spirit beyond dogma and all the erroneous beliefs that are held on earth and was simultaneously exalted, freed, and shamed. 

I contacted in spirit my friend on earth, Anthony Borgia who was a very great medium and through him I communicated the truths that I had begun to see and as a writer I could do this with a certain degree of eloquence, simple eloquence and Anthony received this information beautifully. Since those days, if you read what Anthony Borgia received where I had progressed to the fifth sphere, I have progressed in the Love of God, to the seventh where I am on the precipice of entering the Celestial Kingdom.
     
I know it has been the desire of many here to reach the Divine Love spheres and enter the Celestial realm, but I can tell you that even the lower spirit realms (2nd and 3rd spheres) that have a degree of light, far outshine the light on earth, the exception being within these circles of prayer, where there is a good deal of light and love and the company of many Celestial Angels who have allowed me to speak to you tonight. 

I represent someone who believed strongly in the orthodox church dogma (teachings) and preached it and judged others until I had the good fortune of having my eyes opened in truth when I entered the spirit world. I will admit that part of my reason for my writings was a form of penance. I desperately wanted to correct the errors I had put in my earlier writings (on earth). And I am very happy to say my brother here and his small group of friends and others around the world have benefited from what I wrote through Anthony, and I wanted to express my gratitude.<sup>1</sup>
 
I tell you whatever you have held onto that is less than free, less than love, will be dissolved and let go of. It does not matter how far off the mark, and you know the word sin means to miss the mark.  It does not matter how you have sinned as the Love of God will redeem you as you continue to be open to the guidance of those who have progressed in Divine Love and those in the Celestial realm. The truths that we share with you are given to give you hope and the assurance that God’s Love will make you anew, a new being. Oh, my brothers and sisters what awaits you in the splendor and glory of the realms of spirit, wherein the love of God is present. It should give you hope. It should ease your minds and rest your hearts. 
 
Lastly, I say to you: *‘hold on to your prayers, hold on in faith, hold on in God that you may let go of all that is not worthy of your walk into the future. And know that you, no matter what, are worthy in the Love of God.’* 
 
I thank you. May God bless you. I am Robert Hugh Benson a redeemed soul and your brother in Christ.
