I am Orion. Oh, there is a great hunger out there, for truth, for comfort, for love. You see this in your efforts to gather those together in times to come. They are eager. They wish fellowship. They wish the affirmation of truth to be shared amongst themselves. They wish for further truth for their affirmation and to continue in this great flow of the progress of the soul to receiving the gift of God’s Love. Those of you who gather together and will gather together are the fortunate few. You have found together such a treasure trove of light and truth that indeed within each one of you is a desire to acknowledge and celebrate such a gift, such truths shared willingly and abundantly among you.

What of those who are seeking but have much trouble finding the truth, though the truth is certainly within various avenues and ways that are available to most of you upon this planet? It is often hidden away beyond the purview of many and for those who find some passage, some explanation through their search, often doubt and question. For it does not fit their mindful paradigms of thought. They cannot reconcile the simple truth to that which is more complex and satisfies the mind in a deeper way. Yet, how satisfying is this pursuit of knowledge? It gives many details and aspects of spirituality but often has trouble entering into the core of one’s heart and soul. For the mind continues to establish its boundaries and parameters, making difficult the possibility of penetrating these restrictions and coming to that place of expansion, of intuiting the truth through the feelings and perceptions of the heart and the soul.

It is for you to teach others of this way of releasing those aspects of mindful and human conditions and coming to that place where truth is expansive and fills the individual with understanding, joy, peace and love. This is your mission, beloved souls. This you must continue to teach wherever you go, whoever you speak to, those who are willing to listen. For this knowledge must catch fire with all you speak to, the fire of the soul, the fire of realisation, the fire that brings the individual to the Source of all love and light and truth. For without this fire taking hold in your world, it becomes a drab and dreary place filled with intellectualism, the dryness, dry as dust, of analysis and ideas and all of those things that are contained within the material mind and the intellect. This has brought humanity a certain measure of advancement materially. It has brought certain knowledge to individuals and to humanity. But it has brought a great imbalance as well, an imbalance in your world that has caused a great destruction that lacks love, sensitivity, deeper perceptions and deeper truth.

Now is the time to infill every soul with the possibility of righting that imbalance, of bringing that much needed aspect alive within the individual. To bring the soul alive is your goal and your purpose. Not that it is you that shall do so, but it is you who will be God’s instruments to help that individual find the way to God, to the truth of love, to all that which is of feeling and knowing, understanding of the soul. These things must come now, within your lifetimes, within this short period of time, this window of opportunity that is given to teach and to share the truth with others before the tumult begins and the opportunities are limited, though they will still remain and you will still be called and guided through this tumult. The possibilities of now, the technologies and the avenues of communication of now are great and can bring many rewards and the fruition of God’s plan to bring the truth to humanity. 

So you must be diligent, my beloved friends. You must be diligent and speak out and when you are invited to speak, speak, beloved souls. When you feel compelled, answer that compelling call from God. When you are guided, be true to your guidance. Do not step back but step forward. Do not be reticent but alive with enthusiasm, love, integrity and humility so that you may speak and others may hear you readily without doubt. I know this is a fine line you must walk. Yet, as you are guided, as you have greater faith within yourself and the gifts that you carry, these things will continue to unfold. The opportunities will continue to multiply. You will see yourself in circumstances and situations that allow for the truth to be spoken, for the light to shine, for you to shine as a light, speaking the truth.

Be that beautiful soul, my beloved friends. Be true to God’s plan, God’s Will for you. Seek it out. If you do not know it, feel it. Seek it out in prayer. Ask to be guided. Ask to know. Ask for the details, the road to be laid before you. And, depending upon the urgency and desire that you have in your prayers, this will open the gates to understanding, knowledge, and perception. It is waiting for you. A great reservoir of guidance and intention from God sits behind the gates of this dam that you have created between yourself and God. It waits for the gates to open and for the truth to flood into your consciousness, for you to truly know and understand and to act with confidence and faith, humility and grace. 
 
It is close. You are coming closer. The trepidation of releasing these floodgates is becoming less. You are finding your way to that lynchpin that will open the doors and allow this flood of light to engulf you and carry you as you are God’s instruments, as you become that beautiful light in the world. May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Orion. My love for you is great as always and I am always pleased to speak and be with you, assure you and encourage you, guide you. God bless you. My love is with you.
