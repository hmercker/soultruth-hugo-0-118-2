# Perfection in Grace

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

I am here, Francis, your brother in Christ. I come in the love of God, in the joy of His grace, and in the great magnetism that is created when souls open to the love of God. For the earth traveler, a compass can help find a direction. For the spiritual traveler, this is a moral compass and prayer which is the true North, connecting the longings of the soul with the heavenly Father’s love. 

When one is in grace, there is a transparency in that one begins to see through the falseness of worldly things and by this, I mean, their inadequacy to bring fulfillment, true joy, true happiness. Of course I do not expect those whom I address this to, to take a vow of poverty, to give up all their material possessions. For in a certain sense, that would be both vain and unnecessary. But rather to be in God’s love, to be awakened in grace, in the clarity of this path, where there is no longer a conundrum of - shall I take this path or that - do this or that - because the soul clearly sees that all choices, all work, all play, and all art that is done in grace and in the love of God, carries that love with it. 

So, as you grow spiritually, choices become easier because of the clarity that is yours. This is one of the gifts that is given in the love of God, and this is why as the master said *‘be perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect’* for it is not material perfection or religious perfection or dogmatic understanding, but the perfect insight that is the Father’s that comes to every soul that abides in His love. This as we have said is the glorious simplicity of grace. This enables each soul to not only love those who are dear to them, who may be part of their family, their culture, their nation, their tribe, but to truly love your enemies. For the world so needs this. For unless love can be the common denominator and of course I speak of God’s love the highest common denominator, for unless this can be the choice, can be the path, the darkness will continue. 

So, pray and shine the light, the love of God from your soul to all, and most especially to those in darkness. You can change the world. The gifts of God’s love transform each soul and, in this transformation, these gifts blossom, open like a rose, the emanations touching all, in the beautiful fragrance of divine love. I thank you and my brother here for allowing me this time. We are many here tonight and we are with you. I step back to be with you in this love, in this beautiful circle in grace. I am Francis of Assisi, your eternal friend and brother in the celestial kingdom. God bless you.
