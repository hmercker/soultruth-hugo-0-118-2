# Easter Message

April 9<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Online Circel of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John Hughes received by Elizabeth Mack

I come to speak about this gift of love that is a gift from God that fills your souls. It is a gift to be given, to be expressed. Let your hearts and your souls sing this love in everything you do. Let it bubble up and be free to be given to the world. That is your task, beloved children of God. That is your work upon this Earth, to let your love flow out to your brothers and sisters that you may allow God to show them upon the Earth that He is love. I love you and I bless you this holy day when our Master showed the people his love, his truth that resides within his soul. We are to do the same, each and every one of us. God bless you.
