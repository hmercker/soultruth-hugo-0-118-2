# An Invitation to Galactic Federation Members

December 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2023

California Retreat, Running Springs, CA, USA

Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

My brothers and sisters in this room from my Father. My brother speaks truly, clearly of what is before you, a path that is lighted with love, yours for the choosing. The love that comes with this path is beyond your comprehension. It is available to all souls who long for, who desire to be at one with our Father, that Soul who created each one of us, so perfectly, so lovingly Who desires to bring us back not only to that perfection but to be renewed into this love that is the greatest of all blessings.

I encourage you to join this path of love. As I have said, it is beyond your comprehension so you can only discover it for yourselves but there will be many who will assist you. Many who will guide you and uplift you. You are my brethren and my love for you is great as it is for all humankind, those who have come before you, those who are here now and those souls yet to be born into this world. My love is great for all of God’s children and I come to this great love from my Father who answers my call for more and more and more of His love.

I am your brother, Jesus and I do love you, truly, each and every one of you and I too thank you for listening. May our Father in heaven, may our Father bless you completely to the extent you are willing to accept His blessings. God bless you.
