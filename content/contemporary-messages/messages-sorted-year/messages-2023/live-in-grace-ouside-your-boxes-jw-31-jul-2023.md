# Live in Grace outside your Boxes

It is I, Yogananda. I wish to relay some thoughts about greater awareness. When you feel the presence of God, of His great love and you allow it to permeate your being, to bless your soul, you find yourself above concern, above worry. For you have allowed your fears and all the disturbances that your mind can bring you that can have a deleterious effect on one’s body to disappear. So, be still with me. Allow your soul to step forward. Give your mind a rest. Rest in God.
    
It is a very human thing to want protection, to organize one’s life in boxes, and depending upon the individual and their focus, these boxes will differ. For example, one who is in physical pain desires a healing, to be free from pain. One who is an athlete, preparing for a competition is focused on their health, their strength, their ability to perform beyond the norm. A scientist or an astronomer may believe that they see the big picture because their attention may be on the vastness of the microcosm or the unimaginable depth and breadth of the universe. All these places where one’s attention goes, no matter big or small, are limitations. 

When you allow the grace and flow of the Creator’s love, to lead the way, to open the door, to break the chains, to guide you, especially when you know not where the next step may be, all things fall in place. The soul receives clarity in God’s love. Walking in grace, being in the flow and the will of the Creator the attention is freed from the limitation, freed in the love of God, freed to be able to share the blessing of this great gift, with a world so in need and as we have told you many times, so bereft of this great truth. 

And did you know everyone in the world desires happiness? When one gives up seeking happiness in material pursuits, physical bliss, delusional thinking, and simply humbles oneself in the calmness, in the stillness, in faith before the Creator and asks for the inflowing of this love Divine, for a healing, for protection, for guidance, I tell you, my dear friends, you will receive it. This you know and this you can share and this you can live, in this Love, in this Grace. There is no need to figure it out. There is no need for some great analysis, which just leads you down a rabbit hole; the mind struggling to analyze, compartmentalize. 
   
Allow your soul to be touched by God, where the soul’s mind is in ascendency. My dear ones, live in grace. Let go of all else if you truly wish to be in bliss, to be free, and to be at one with God. 
   
We love you deeply for all time and beyond. May the love of God infill each one of you as you let go and allow it to come in this great blessing. I am your brother in Christ and eternal friend. I am Yogananda.
