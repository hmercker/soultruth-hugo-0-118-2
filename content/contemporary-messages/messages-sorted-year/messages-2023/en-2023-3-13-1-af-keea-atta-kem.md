Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

I am Keea Atta Kem. Yes, we are happy to see you together, and we are happy that we have had these many years together in development, in growth of the soul, in your continuous awakening and flourishing in God’s Love. This development will not cease or be entirely complete as you continue your journey upon this earthly plane, but it runs in tandem with the Love that grows within your souls. It is a response to this Love that continues to bring Light and transformation within.

As you progress in God’s Love, so the faculties of the soul, of the spirit, of the mind will continue to grow and respond to this gift. You will change in many ways--perceptions, feelings, what you focus upon, what is important to you, and how you may serve God in this great world so in need of light and truth and love, and compassion to embrace many. You will find yourself looking in many other different directions, many places that you had not considered, many actions and activities that you would not think you would engage within.

As you grow in God’s Love, so do these gifts and abilities grow. They will be reflected and expressed in such a variety of ways that it will surprise you, beloved souls. It will surprise you, what you are able to do, how you are able to move in the world, how you can be used as an instrument of God’s Will, a channel for His Love. Gifts of healing and teaching and speaking, manifesting many things will come in the stead of God’s Love, for this great foundation you have laid in prayer will continue to bring forth many things.

The journey will never be dull or inactive or stagnant, it will continue to move forward for more development. Your awakening will continue always because this is the way of God’s transformative Love. This is the way of the soul that has such great potentials, a soul that is eager to burst forth in all its beauty, in all its abilities, all its gifts as you reflect the divine within you, as this condition of light grows, as you receive more of the Essence of God’s Soul that awakens and enlivens everything.

You are releasing those inhibitions that keep you from these expressions of light and gifts. There is more confidence and peace within you. There is more understanding of the Truth and how it may manifest within each of you. There is greater desire to serve and express yourselves in all its uniqueness and power and beauty; the soul that you are walking forth in the world as a light.

Beloveds, beloveds, may you continue to see yourself as a great potential being that is growing and gestating and awakening. The flowering of your soul takes time; the flowering continues with each day. So, you find yourself stretching and growing with each day, considering the possibilities of each day, of allowing yourself to be further immersed within the flow of God’s Will and God’s Love. See yourselves in this light. Know yourselves in this way. Be true to your blossoming, beautiful soul growing and emerging like a butterfly from the pupa.

Beloveds, greater beauty, greater expression, greater love is emerging and finding its way in the world and we surround you as you are birthed in Light and Love. We are with you. God puts His Hand upon you and you feel the strength, the comfort and the Love that comes with this. Do not step back but be true to the desire of your soul to step forward. Be true to those potentials and possibilities that continue to manifest in your life. Have faith that all will unfold in harmony and all will unfold in love. In this way, God orchestrates your awakening, your transformation, and the emergence of your wonderful soul into the world.

May God bless you, beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem and you know that I love you. I am close always, always to assist you on this journey as you become that beautiful butterfly in the world. I love you. I love you. God bless you.
