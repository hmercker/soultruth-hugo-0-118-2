# Prayer for Divine Love Blessings

June 18<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

Rejoice, for you have found the truth that will truly transform you. I am Jesus. I come to pray with you, for I too know of this truth and have taught this truth through millennia of time. So, together we rejoice in the truth. The power of God’s Essence, His Love, shall transform us and change us forever upon a path that shall be lit and straight and direct to at-onement with God. We have found the key, and together we shall travel upon this path that shall bring enlightenment, the glory of all truth. The wonderment of all creation shall be ours as we walk this path together, beloveds, as we seek to enrich our soul with the very Essence of the Creator, that succor that shall never be withheld, that Love that shall go on forever.

Beloveds, we are truly blessed, and we shall find greater blessings as we continue to travel this road of truth and love. In this, may we be God’s channels of love, a bright light in the world, and declare this truth to the world. For, now all of humanity suffers with a lack of true love and true understanding of love. It is for us to enlighten our brothers and sisters of the highest Love and the Source of that gift.

Walk into the world in joy with the understanding that God will use you as His instruments upon this Path Divine, and that you will be inspired, you will be awakened, you will know the glories of a soul that has found its mark with its Creator, a soul that will be opened like a flower to the warmth and sunlight of God’s Love, a soul resplendent in gifts that, one by one, will be displayed and expressed as you journey upon this road. In this, you will know wisdom and joy, love. So you shall rejoice in all of these things beyond the limitations of the human mind and condition. You shall pass beyond these things to a place of freedom and unlimited possibilities.

It comes with one gift. It comes with your prayers. It comes as you have faith in the journey towards at-atonement with God, and so all healing and upliftment and banishment of darkness that you may be enwrapped in light and know the comfort, the peace, and the joy of our Heavenly Father’s Touch upon you. It is given freely. It is given by your request, the longings of your soul. Dig deep within you and feel that longing and know it. Cherish that longing and nurture that longing, that you may walk in light always, God’s protection upon you, His Grace about you, so that you are truly a light in the world, truly one of God’s channels of love, an instrument for change and healing and truth.

All these things will be given to you, beloveds, provided you allow the great gift to flow within you and change you and make you into this being of which I speak, this glorious being which is you, beloveds, each of you beautiful and unique souls upon your world, who has the potential to express many things, the gifts to manifest many blessings.

My beloveds, you are my brothers and sisters. We walk together upon the sacred path of love, and so we shall forever more. I shall be beside you always. My brethren, always we shall walk together. I love you. I am your brother and friend Jesus, and I love you. Each of you is my friend, my brother, my sister, and so it shall be for all eternity. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you in love.
