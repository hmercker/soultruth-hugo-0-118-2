May God be with you and bless you, beloved souls. I am Martha, Martha of the Bible. You have asked for one of us who lived on the Earthly plane in Jesus' time and who were supportive of him to come and speak. Indeed I was a woman who had a humble life and yet my heart was full of love, kindness and generosity. This is my nature. God used me in many ways to help bless those who were beginning to formulate the great efforts of God to bring the truth of God's Love to the world. 

That was many, many years ago now. Now I reside within the Celestial Kingdom. As you speak of women and men, I say to you within the Kingdom of God, these distinctions are no longer so important. Rather, there is a fragrance of femininity about my personality as there is a masculinity about others, but these are not the great aspects of our being that delineate us from one another. Rather, it is our personalities, our presence, who we are as God's great soul redeemed in Love. We do not distinguish so readily nor do we care about these differences as you might do upon the earthly plane. We are truly in harmony with one another and there is an intimacy of thought, of being together that precludes any pretense or desire to be true to an image or thought of what masculine or feminine is. Rather, it is truly our essence expressed in all its beauty, uniqueness and glory as God has made us and God has fulfilled us in His Love. 

Think of your brothers and sisters as souls who inhabit a body, that the soul is the most precious and wondrous aspect of every human being. We who come to you on the Earthly plane come to nurture this soul, come to be with you soul to soul, and we do not concern ourselves with sexual identity or ideas in that regard. Rather, we come to be with that individuated soul and to help them come closer to God. Thus, we have no judgments or no expectations of that individual. God's Love for each individual does not require certain aspects and expressions, that in your world is so standardised and expected. 

In our world such things do not exist. Judgment does not exist. Each soul is appreciated for its uniqueness, its beauty, its expressions, both what you might call masculine and feminine. These things of course are an outdated perspective and when your time comes to enter into the world of the Celestial Kingdom, you will come to understand what I say. You will come to see yourself very differently from what you are today and how you see yourself today. For as the soul is transformed by the great gift of the Father's Love flowing, flowing into you, so the expressions of the soul, your core of being will be so much more a reflection of the Divine and the capacities and attributes of the Divine. 

You are heading in this direction, beloved souls. You are seeking the redemption, the transformation, the true understanding of yourself. In this journey you will release many aspects, thoughts and ideas about yourself so that it will not be relevant to your present condition and life. So, when you see another who is entrenched in certain perspectives, rigidity of thought, conditions that have been imposed upon them by a world that is so enamored with definition and ideas of expression, have compassion for them. 

Know that in time, even they will find their way to a place where all these things are not relevant or truly a part of them. Your minds, as they traverse the Divine Path, will be absorbed into the mind of the soul, and in that absorption and integration, so little of the old self, the ideas that linger in the material world, will no longer be in existence and you will find yourself liberated from these restrictions and concepts. This is true transformation is it not? Each of us have gone through this process to the point where we were able to enter into the Celestial Kingdom, a place of joy unimaginable, a place of expression multidimensional and filled with many gifts and capacities far beyond your imaginings. 

My beloved friends, brothers and sisters who seek the great gift, know that you will be escorted by angels as you pass through all these phases and machinations of a soul transformed, released from the burdens and errors of human creation. We will be with you and know that you are loved deeply, that we will be with you in love, will help you to understand how these changes are relevant and important, help you to let go of those things you are so attached to within your mindful reckonings, help you to be in joy, freedom and love that is so important, so necessary not only for you but for this world. 

Be that beautiful soul that God intends for you to be. Let go of those conditions that are contrary to this and know the liberation and joy of a life lived in harmony with the laws of God, with the Love of God. I am Martha and I love you dearly, and I continue to pray for you, my beloved friends. I am with you and indeed, I love each and every one of you. God bless you. God bless you dear ones. My love is with you. God bless you.
