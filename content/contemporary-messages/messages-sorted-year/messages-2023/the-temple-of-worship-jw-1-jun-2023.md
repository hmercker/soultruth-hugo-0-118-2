# The Temple of Worship

June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your brother and friend, Robert J. Lees. As always, I am delighted whenever anyone or any group reads what I received and is touched in God’s love and inspired to move forward, onward, and upward to His kingdom. I wish to clarify something for you all about what you have just read.<sup>1</sup> The point of the author being, that those who had suffered in their belief in the Master’s teachings in all the horrendous ways that are mentioned, that they will be honored in the same way the Master is honored for his sufferings on the cross, in the garden, and so forth because it is an act of faith to stand for truth but when the soul knows without a doubt; this is faith in action. Those beautiful souls, who laid down their lives, as did the Master for the truth, hold a very special place in the kingdom. And so, be not confused about his matter or about the purpose of the Temple that is mentioned. The Temple of Worship is to God. The honor is for all those who love God and who gave all and the message to Aphrar was be willing to let the world go for the sake of God, for the sake of your brethren and sisters, for the sake of lifting all in the great love of God. This will be your entry on the path and into the kingdom. 
   
I hope I have shown some light upon your wonderings, and I thank my brother for stepping forward. All of us here love you deeply, embrace you all in ways you may not see except upon reflection when you realize the path has been made clear, a wound has been healed, an insight has been revealed, and then all suddenly becomes apparent. For when the soul rests in grace all things become clear and sin and error dissolve like a mist against the sun’s light. 
   
May the love of God lead you on this path beyond fear, beyond any concern of your mortal coil, in the knowing that your destiny is celestial. How we love you, may God bless each one. I am your brother and friend in the love of God, in Christ. 
   
I am Robert J. Lees.
