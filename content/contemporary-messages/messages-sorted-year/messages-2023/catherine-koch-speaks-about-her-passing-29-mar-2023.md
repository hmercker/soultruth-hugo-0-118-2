It is Catherine and I am happy to be able to utilise my dear friend here to speak about my passing and my fate. It has certainly been a good run, don’t you think, my efforts, something that began as a mere idea that blossomed and bore much fruit? These efforts that I made, I did for God, I did for those whom I felt were so much in need. I made great efforts to help fulfil those needs in a way that I thought was constructive and beneficial for all who I met. 

But that time now has ended. I must confess that, to some degree, I am relieved in passing. I did not reveal too much about my physical problems and burdens, but I must say that, near the end, they were becoming intolerable. The pain was great. Indeed, this is a mercy to me to pass so quickly. Now I know the freedom, the wonderment of merely living in a spirit body rather than having the physical problems that I did. 
I want all of those who know me to realise that every effort has its beginnings and its ends. Everything flows towards greater harmony in time. I am well assured by those who have come to comfort me in spirit, that the work will continue, though it will take a different turn because I am not there. Indeed, I want to assure everyone that this work will evolve and continue as it must. There is so much need out there in the world and I want to be a part of the solutions, part of those who are seeking to bring support and love to those who are downtrodden and lost. I will not be removed from this effort. Rather, my approach and what I can contribute has changed. I will continue to seek ways and means to help bring about the solutions that are now growing. The momentum of them continue to have their effects in this part of the world which I inhabited. 

There are so many more needed, more individuals who see beyond their own needs and seek to place the needs of others before themselves. In this way, God blesses us all, does He not? God’s beautiful Hand of Love and Light upon us all, protecting and blessing, keeping us true to the light. My wish is that each of you who hear my message today may continue to support and to uphold the work that I began and that others have continued to express in the world that bring love. Love is expressed in many different ways, but love is always the answer to the solution. Love is truly the power that makes change, that heals and brings light and relief to so many. 

Think of my passing as a blessing for me. I know that I will be missed and, indeed, there is always more work to do. It is endless, endless, my friends. But I will continue to support those who are seeking to do all that which is of goodness and light and love. My soul compels me forward in this way. I have learned to listen to my soul and to act accordingly. This does not change. Merely the way in which I might express myself has changed. Remember that I will be close, close at hand. I will attempt to influence and be a support to those who take up this torch of service and love for the dear children in Uganda and elsewhere. 

There is still a lot of work to do, as you know and much can still be accomplished. Hopefully there will be those who will take up my position and work in harmony with the intentions of our organization. May you find the way and means to bring that individual forward that they may work with the support of those around the world. Yes, there is so much that still needs to be done. Do not give up hope because I have left the fleshy body. Rather, understand that everything must progress and evolve in such a way that, indeed, the Divine plan may be expressed, that God may work in many ways. I was just one instrument of many, many.

So, God’s plan will continue to unfold and light will continue to flourish through those who are dedicated to light. Be open to the possibilities, be true to your guidance and know that I am close, guiding as well. May love flourish in all of your lives and love flourish in this effort to uphold the children. May love truly be the answer to these continued dilemmas that so many face in the world. 

Know that I love you and I thank you all for your support, for your loving support. And my appreciation, oh, if you only knew how much I appreciate each and every one of you, all that have stood up in support of my efforts. Because you have stood up to support God’s efforts to bring relief, comfort, solutions to the many lost souls in the world. This will continue. Know that I love you all. I will from time to time, hopefully, bring to you my reports as to my progress, my continued adventure, journey into the unknown. Yet while I am here, all seems so familiar and so comfortable. I have joy in my heart, my friends, because I am released of the pain of the physical, the burdens that I carried and now know the great freedom and joy that comes by transitioning into the spirit world. 

I look ahead, my friends. I am eager in anticipation for the next chapter of my life. May you all be blessed in love. May you all be in the light, and may we all work together for the good of humanity. I am Catherine Koch and my love is with you all. Blessings to you, love to you. Thank you.
