Truth comes from many different sources, does it not, upon your Earth plane. It is dependant upon the cultures and perspectives of those who live around the globe in many different places. Their version of truth will reflect their life experiences. They will see the world from that perspective as it was with us, is it not, my friends. I came from India which is steeped in many traditions, ideas and perceptions of the truth and indeed, there is a great deal of truth in that country and those perspectives. But it is not all of the truth. And so it is around your globe. Each race, creed, religion provides a measure of truth, a certain element of understanding of which that particular sect or creed has focussed upon. And that is given as a gift to the world. Also, because humanity is so rife with imagination and a measure of conceit, therefore creating in detail and ideas around a particular truth, then it becomes smothered in dogma, doctrine, ritual, many things. So thereby creating in the minds of men, something more important, more potent in their lives. 

Truth is not an easy thing to come by. Although truth is often simple and clear, it is not made so by the minds of men. So truth is obscured in the details, in the flourishments and additions to that truth, thereby empowering those who create such things, telling others that they are more important, and powerful, that they have perceptions of truth that the others do not. In my country, it is full of gurus, those who are the teachers and who reinforce particular messages and ideas to others and these gurus seek followers to come to them at their feet and listen and to act upon that which they are giving as a message of truth. Indeed, often truth is given through these individuals. But as I have said, there are additions to it that are unnecessary and obscure of the main message. You, my friends, are seeking pure truth. It is evident in your prayers and your efforts. You wish to have the unadorned truth and indeed, the truth is given to you as clearly as is possible through the layers of this Earthly plane and through the conditions and channels of communication that are possible in this condition. Yet you are closer to the truth than many, many others. What a gift this is to you all. And I suggest that you honor this gift as much as you can and do not allow the flouishments and additions to obscure it. For what a gift to humanity this is, to have the truth as unadorned as possible, given in such a clear and powerful way.

So you carry the responsibility to uphold the truth as best as you can, to be the truth in everything that you are, to see the world through the lens of truth, to be that instrument of truth for the great Source of all truth. And truth, of course, evolves within your consciousness as you evolve. Greater clarity comes with the soul awakened to truth. Thus, the journey is that of continuous development, awakening and growth beyond that of the material mind, far beyond that, to that place of the mind and soul so resplendent in God’s love, so inclined towards truth in such a way that the mind alone can never be.

I urge you on, my friends. I urge you on your journey toward truth and to be true to what you understand and come to see through the eyes of the soul, the wisdom of the soul, the perceptions of the soul. For this is the true journey that will bring you to the truth. This is the way as our beloved Jesus has taught. This is the way to truth as simple as it is, powerful as it manifests. The beauty of truth brings expansive joy and bliss, the wonders of God’s soul touching yours is beyond your imaginings. It is an experience that shall change you forever. 
 
I urge you on, my friends. I urge you on. I am Yogananda and my love is with you all. How I do not envy on this Earthly plane filled with so much that I not of truth and how I know the freedom and joy of these beautiful communions with God. I will show you the way, my friends. I will show you the way as well as my cohorts in the Celestial Kingdom. Keep your eyes and ears, your minds and souls, your material minds open, open, open to what can be given to what can be experienced upon this beautiful planet. God bless you. God keep you. God show you. God be with you. I am Yogananda and I love you.
