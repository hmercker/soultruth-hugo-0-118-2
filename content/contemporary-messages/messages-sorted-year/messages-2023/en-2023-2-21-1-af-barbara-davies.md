Barbara Davies received by Al Fike

Bless you, beloved family of God, I am Barbara. I wish to come and tell you about how you draw your loved ones to you, those who are in the spirit world; your mothers and fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents, their grandparents, and so on. These  generations of souls who are still seeking further light and love, they have found an avenue to answer their questions and their soul’s desires through you, beloved souls, because you have made the clear choice, you have come to God in such a powerful way that those who are close to you see your light and are drawn to your light.

So, you see your efforts reach far in many different directions as you continue to seek the Light of God, the Love of God. The influence of the Light pulsates out from you and through you to many. Those who are close to you and who follow this highest path upon the earthly plane may be few but remember your brothers and sisters in the world of spirit who are seeking more intensely than those of you on the earthly plane because they are not distracted by the earthly desires and conditions. They are purely in spirit, and those who have gone beyond the lower planes understand this and understand the journey that they must take. My beautiful friends, you are helping them because it is far easier for them to observe you and to be close to you than it is for them to reach up to those higher spirits and Celestial beings that are far beyond their spiritual condition and state of soul. You are the ones who are leading by example, by prayer, by your light.

Remember this, beloved souls, as you continue to strive for greater soul progression and a higher state of being. Remember, you not only do this for yourself, but you do this for your families, your ancestors, and many more in spirit, as well as those on the earthly plane. As you realize the scope and breadth and depth of your efforts, I hope that you are deeply dedicated and seek greater soul progression for God’s Love with each and every day, for your efforts have a great impact not only in the material world, but in the spirit world.

So, I encourage you in your prayers, in your thoughts, and those things that you do in the world. Seek to serve God, seek to serve your brothers and sisters, seek to be in the light. In this way, you will be a light and you will bring to you greater light as you seek the journey of the soul towards at-onement with God.

May God bless you, beloved souls, I am Barbara. I am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom and I’m happy to come to you today and speak of things that are important spiritual matters, ways to be of greater light and service in the world. God bless you, my beautiful family of love, God bless you, and I love you.
