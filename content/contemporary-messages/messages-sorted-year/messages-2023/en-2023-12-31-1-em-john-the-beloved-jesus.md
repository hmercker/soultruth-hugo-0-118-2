John the Beloved & Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I thank you, dear beloved sister, for your love, for your prayer to the Father as we bring many, many, many spirits into this circle to receive the blessings that you have requested in your prayer. I am your brother **John, Beloved** and I seek to spend this time with you, as do many of our brothers and sisters, more than you know, more than you can count who were drawn here by this light, who were drawn here to be given the gift of Divine Love into their souls, who are drawn here to receive all that the Creator of the universe has to give. For there are many, many who are in need upon this planet, many who are in need, even across this universe and many who come seeking the truth, that they may find it in their souls this day. You are all blessed, abundantly blessed for being here at this time, in this way to lift up your souls’ desires, your souls’ longings for this love. And now, the Master comes from high in the Celestial Heavens to bring his blessings and message of joy and love for the New Year.

I come to you this day on behalf of all who seek truth and at the direction of my Father. I am **Jesus** and my love is with all of you, as is my Father’s love that comes through me to you. You are blessed among humankind. You are blessed among spirits who still seek to know the truth of God’s love for each of His children. You are therefore blessed mightily for this love comes to you this day. This love is available to you. Open your souls and allow this outpouring from our Father to each individual soul. God blesses you and rains down his love upon you while uplifting you to the higher spheres that you may walk there in God’s glory, that you may know the truth of His love for each one of you. 
You are blessed mightily with gifts that will bring you forward, with gifts that will open and awaken within you in a very short time. You are blessed with the mightiest blessing of all, God’s love. Awaken children, awaken. Awaken. You are beloved. You are nurtured. You are healed. You are brought forward.

I am your brother and I will lead you into your homes in the Celestial Heaven. I will walk with you on this path as will many who have tread this path before you. You will never be alone. You will never want. For you are greatly and deeply loved and protected. You are on your way home to the Father. May God bless you, every step of the way and we bless you with our love. Be in joy. Be in faith. Live this truth. Live this love that you may come to know your Father in all His glory and all of His Being. May God bless you. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens and I love you, each each of you and every one of you deeply and completely. I am truly with you.
