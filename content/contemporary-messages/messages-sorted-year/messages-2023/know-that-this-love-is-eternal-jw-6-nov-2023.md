# Know that this love is Eternal

November 6<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

It is I, Claire. I come to serve you and I come with many. We live in the light and love of the heavenly Father who extends this light and love to you. You must know there is no request too small, no request too large, for almighty God. I come to be with the sister who needs healing to bring peace upon her, to assure her all is in God’s hands and in His time, to rest in faith. When one is upon the earth and under the influence of earthly laws, it can be quite perplexing to the mind to envision a future beyond the earth realm. For most wonder about this, whether they are believers or not.

My dear ones, you who feel the magnetic pull of the grace of God that connects you in His love, in His light, allow this to be where you to reside, that you may have clarity of soul, that you may begin to not only feel the love of God in your being but also come to know that this love is eternal, this love in your soul truly brings immortality, truly connects you, not only to God but to the realms of light and love where true happiness prevails. 

In the midst of the cacophony of earth life, its demands, the material world seems to have precedence in every aspect of life and yet one drop of Divine Love frees you, pulls you up in spiritual magnetism in this grace where we are in this moment with open hearts as God infills our souls, rest in this love, be blessed in this love, be one in this love. This at-one-ment is the true *“atonement”.* This grace that is above the world as we like to say, and yet embraces it. 
     
May your hearts be full of joy. May your doubts dissolve. There is no request too small. There is no request too large. For our God is Supreme and knows your heart and the longings of your souls which shall always bring His response in Love. May this Love be yours and I thank you for this time. 

In the grace of God, I shall step back and join you. We all shall. With all our love and blessings, may the Peace of God be upon you all. I am your sister in Christ. I am Claire, once of Assisi, now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom, and your eternal friend, always here for you. God bless you. God bless you.
