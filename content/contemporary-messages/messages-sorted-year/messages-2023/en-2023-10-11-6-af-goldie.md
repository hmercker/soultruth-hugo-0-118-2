# A Gift Suggestion for Each Weary Traveller

October 11<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Laurelville Collection, Laurelville, PA, USA

Goldie received by Al Fike

I have a suggestion. Can you give each one who comes through the door a little flower, a little gift, a ray of sunshine for them? For many will be weary of their travels but this little flower will indicate that God is with them, that they are loved. A smile on your face, the brightness of your eyes and the cheeriness of your embrace, all these things will say *"you are welcome, you are loved and you are a part of this great gathering." *

Indeed, I will be there to cheer everybody. My dear friend on my left has no trouble laughing and being cheerful, so she will be as will the rest of you. 

**Jeanne:** You want daffodils behind each ear? 

No, it is not the season, dear. 

**Jeanne:** What do you suggest?

Chrysanthemums will be lovely, little ones.

**Jeanne:** Little ones.

I am so happy I have friends on Earth that we can talk to and be with.

**Jeanne:** We are so happy we have friends in Heaven.

Indeed you have many friends in Heaven, many who you do not even know.

**Jeanne:** Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.

Indeed they are. Any friend of mine is a friend of yours.

**Jeanne:** Oh! Perfect.

Aren't we all blessed to be friends?

**Jeanne:** Yes.

God bless you, my friends. God bless you. I love you so. How blessed we are in God's Love.

**Jeanne:** Thank you.

God bless you. God bless you. Goldie loves you. Goldie loves you.
