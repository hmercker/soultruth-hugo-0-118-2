May the Divine love continue to connect each one of you to God. I am Keea Atta Kem and I come to be with you in your prayers, your longings, your desires, your efforts to uplift and uphold one another in the world. What a precious gift each of you is in this world. What a beautiful light that you bring because you made one decision in your life. That is, that you wish to be with God. That you desire, from that deep place within you, a relationship with your Creator. 

God always responds to these heartfelt and deep longings. He has brought you into the light of truth, into the loving arms of His embrace, into all that is of light and goodness. You will find your way more fully into these beautiful conditions of love so that you may become that strong chain. A chain that does not bind, but frees all from the tyranny of the human condition. 

As our dear daughter says in her prayer, so few understand and many are lost to this condition. But there are the precious few in the world who keep alive the flame of truth, who keep alive the hope for humanity that all shall become light, love, healing and grace. That the world shall be healed and unshackled. That the world will again be claimed by God. That all things that are not of God will be banished forever. 
As you continue to strive, search, pray, and long for all that is of God, know that your prayers are heard. Know that your longings are bearing fruit, and gifts of the soul are awakening with the deep Touch of God. As you awaken, you will understand the Laws of Love. As you bring the light into your soul through your prayers, asking God to Touch you deeply with His Love, the truth becomes a powerful part of your being and your light. The truth is expressed in your countenance, your actions, your thoughts. 

Though this may not be the only part of you that is expressed, it is becoming a growing power of light within you. It is informing more and more your actions, thoughts, deeds  and efforts. It is bringing to you a sense of wonder, of awakening, of change and transformation that will not hold you from the dark conditions of the world, but will liberate you and bring you freedom. 

Beloved souls, know that the Love of God is the key to all things of the soul. That as you continue to awaken to this love, to receive it in greater and greater quantities, then you fulfil the purpose of your soul. Which is to be transformed in love, finding at-onement with God. The journey from creation to awakening. From that place where you existed in the light to that place where you become an embodiment of the light.

My beloveds, you are blessed. You are loved. All comes in the glory and wonderment of God’s Touch. May you find your place in the firmament of God’s beautiful creation that is of love, bringing you to the Celestial Kingdom, ensuring a journey that is eternal. Becoming a great gift that shall never cease within you. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you. I love you so much, beloveds. For you are the budding flowers of God’s creation, each petal glorious and beautiful. As you reveal your beautiful soul to God and do what it is meant to do and be, then the beauty becomes great. It is exponential and it is eternal. In all the glory that is your soul, God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
