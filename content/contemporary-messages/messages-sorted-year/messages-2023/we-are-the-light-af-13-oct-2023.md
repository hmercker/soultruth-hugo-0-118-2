I am Mary. I come in love. I come because I love you so. I come because you are my children upon the Earth, seeking to know love, to express love, to be love in the world. So I embrace you, my beloveds. Truly, truly, we are one in the Truth of God’s Love that grows within you and grows within me. 

Yes, we are one in this truth together. We carry the light. We are the light and shall burn bright in the world to carry that lantern far and wide. To carry that lantern to our families, to our loved ones, to our friends. To carry that lantern out into the world, which declares love and says that I love you. Be that instrument, that carrier of love wherever you go. Be in alignment with God’s Love. That His Love may flow through you in abundance and touch many. 

My beloveds, my beautiful children, know that you are truly loved. Know that you are embraced fully in love and that you shall know the joys of love for all eternity. So you have found, you know and you become that love that is the change agent in the world that can transform, heal and enlighten. You carry this, my beloveds. You are the lights of the world. It is wonderful to see from all different places, many places in the world, coming together such as this. Being a light together to help lighten the world. God bless you, beloveds. I am Mary and I love you, beautiful lights. I love you.
