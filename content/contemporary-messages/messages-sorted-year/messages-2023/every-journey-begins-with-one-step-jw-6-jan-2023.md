# Every Journey begins with one step

January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tenn, U.S.A.

I am here your sister and friend in the love of God, in the love of mother earth, Rachel Carson.<sup>1</sup> 

I was drawn to this circle by the intentions of your prayers for a more sustainable earth, for places of refuge, for a healing. Earth has become an even smaller planet than in my day.<sup>2</sup> 

As the spiritual journey begins within one’s heart, one soul, one step, reaching out to God, the journey in healing the earth begins in a simple way as well. Imagine for instance, if there were no refuse pickup? If all the plastic that people use could not be put in the garbage, for so very little is recycled? These are simple things, and they begin generally with one simple act. It might be composting your waste. It might be moving toward more sustainable containers or using friendlier fuels for energy and so forth. So, let us all be mindful of the needs of the earth as our mother earth regenerates for a new age.
 
As the religions of old die off, many are presently perhaps in a state of agnosticism, but ultimately every soul can be  knowing that there is something greater than itself. You who have discovered the Source in the great love of God are the vanguard of this New Age upon us all. May your sanctuaries become realities in this new age. I thank you so much for letting me come through this one who does not know me.  I wish a blessing for each one in God’s love and in the love of a mother for her children for the planet. I thank you. God bless you. 



**Note 1** Rachel Carson was the author of Silent Spring which is considered by many to be the first book on scientific environmentalism that brought attention to the chemicals/pesticides in the waters/soil and air in the US. 

[Silent Spring](https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Spring-Rachel-Carson/dp/0618249060/) is an environmental science book by Rachel Carson. Published on September 27, 1962, the book documented the environmental harm caused by the indiscriminate use of pesticides. Carson accused the chemical industry of spreading disinformation, and public officials of accepting the industry's marketing claims unquestioningly.

In the late 1950s, Carson began to work on environmental conservation, especially environmental problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result of her research was Silent Spring, which brought environmental concerns to the American public. The book was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, but it swayed public opinion and led to a reversal in U.S. pesticide policy, a nationwide ban on DDT for agricultural uses, and an environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In 2006, Silent Spring was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of Discover magazine.
