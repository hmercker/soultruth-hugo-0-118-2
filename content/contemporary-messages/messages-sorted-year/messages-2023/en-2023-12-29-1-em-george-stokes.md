# We Believe in You

December 29<sup>th</sup>, 2023

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

George Stokes received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now. I am George. Yes, you are indeed faithful. You faithfully come to these circles. You faithfully put forward your prayer requests, knowing that the Father will answer these prayers, not only your requests, but also by bringing forth His Divine Love to touch your souls, so that your souls may develop and may grow in Light and Love.

An essential part of all the universes is God's Love. This He offers to those souls that He has created that are His children, not only upon the Earth, but across the universe. We do believe in you. We do know that with this Love in your souls, you will be transformed. We know because we too were once in the flesh upon the world and surrounded by the same kinds of environment and negativities that surround you today. Yet, here we are in the Celestial Heavens, serving our Father.

Yes, we believe in you too and have faith that with each step that you take, the Father's Love will be guiding you. We will walk with you. We are joyous when you come together like this, pray together and allow us to uplift you above this human condition. We are joyous when we see your souls so bright and so loving. You are beautiful and true children of our Heavenly Father. We greet you as brothers and sisters who will one day join us in these Celestial Heavens.

May God bless you abundantly, filling your souls with so much Love and so much beauty, that they one day will overtake your minds and your bodies and shine through so that all those who have yet to experience this Love will see for themselves the beauty that God has created and that God has rebirthed.

My love is with you. I am George. I live in the Celestial Heavens, where many of us who are here with you tonight live. God bless you. God bless you, dear children. May God bless you mightily.
