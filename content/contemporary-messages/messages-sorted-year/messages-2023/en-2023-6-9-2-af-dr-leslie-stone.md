Dr Leslie Stone received by Al Fike

I am Leslie Stone. I wish to reinforce my [beloved brotherâ€™s message](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2023/en-2023-6-9-1-af-james-padgett/). I too, want to encourage you on this path of service. This path that God will guide you upon will open doors for you, will inspire you, and bring to you all that you require to be His instruments of love and truth in the world.

Be true to your soul. Be true to the truth. Walk in the way of love, each of you doing so in your unique and beautiful souls, expressing and being the light that has encouraged you to blossom and to be those beautiful children of God. Walk with God, beloveds, beautiful souls. Be of love, express love. We shall be close, encouraging and uplifting, bringing greater light, inspiration.

I am Leslie Stone. My love for you is great, my friends on Earth. I fully understand your struggles, but yet, you persist. This is the way to bring what is needed to the world. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.
