Orion received by Al Fike

…our souls, indeed, this is what is required. My beloved friends, I am Orion and I join you in these prayers, as always. Not once have I not joined you and been with you as are many dedicated souls, those in the Celestial Heavens, those elsewhere, those bright spirits. Oh yes, we are with you. We are dedicated to the purpose and the aspirations of which you speak. We gather with you, we surround you in light, we uplift you in light. How many upon your earthly plane have such blessings and advantages? Very few indeed, and certainly not a group such as this in unison and harmony together. Such great blessings come to those who understand the dynamics and the mechanics of spirituality. It is not so difficult nor is it so complex. We come together with you in simple yearning and desire.

What comes of this may be intricate and involved in many ways, on many different levels, but we do not require that you know these things. You may feel them, you may have glimpses of these dynamics of energies, these flows of love, creative blessings from God, His Love Divine flowing into your soul. We do not discourage you to perceive these things. Yet, for those of you who do not, it is not a requirement that you know and see and understand. It is merely that you are present with your desires, your unanimity, your closeness that comes with love, your faith. These are the basic spiritual elements that are required. And provided you supply these elements as intensely and powerfully as you can, then the work proceeds. We do the heavy lifting. We are the ones scurrying around mixing various aspects, elements together, sharing them amongst you, doing our best to help create the environment, the conditions by which this wonderful gift that we all aspire towards may be fulfilled.

Indeed, you had a sobering message some days ago about what is required and a report upon your progress. But I wish to add to our beloved brother’s comments that it is very possible for you all to be uplifted into high realms of being, of energetic expression of soul, light, in a short period of time. Think of that ancient story about the Pentecost and how the dear disciples of Jesus came together in earnestness and prayer, confusion, despair, many intense feelings came to them, and they expressed them to God. In that intensity of desire, God responded with a great inflowing of the Essence of His Soul, and it changed each and every one of them. It was almost instantaneous.

So you see the possibilities remain and they are reliant upon your focus and desires. It is not that you require deep psychic insights, mental dissections and speculations. No, these things are not required. Instead, we are working with your soul, and that soul has a very different way of viewing the world, of viewing reality. The more alignment you have with your soul, the more you allow your soul its free reign, the easier it will be for all of us. Remember this, my beloved friends, it is the soul that must catch fire and be awakened, and all the faculties and elements of the soul blessed by the great Essence of God, are the key to the success of our venture.

Continue in your prayers and longings. Do not allow the mental conditions, the human condition, the inner condition of humanness that each of you carry, to inhibit this powerful awakening and process of soul development. Rather, have faith in your true self, for within you is a great light, each of you. It is acknowledging this light, nurturing this light, focusing upon it, and focusing upon your relationship with your Creator that many miraculous things may be accomplished, many blessings and manifestations may come.

Your beloved brother Jesus is the ultimate example of these possibilities. Yet, even he was not so far upon the road, because that road is eternal and in 2000 years, he has developed greatly in his capacities. There are many who have entered into the Celestial Kingdom who have far surpassed his abilities on Earth. This process in its infinite ways, its mysteries and wonders, is a magnificent aspect of God’s Creation, each of you so blessed, so filled with potentials that are far beyond your comprehension. Think of yourself in this way, beloved souls. You have barely scratched the surface of your gifts and the potentials of your soul when awakened with the Essence of God. Yet, each of you has a destiny, a journey towards at-onement with God, towards light, fulfillment of the light that you are and shall be. The seed has just sprouted. Such tender shoots are you, my beloveds. How tender we feel towards you, how much we love you, how much we see and appreciate what God has created, how much we pray for you and minister upon you. I urge you to receive every blessing, every drop of love, every gift given, every opportunity afforded to you so that you may grow swiftly, that your gifts may open and flourish powerfully, that you may truly be a light and be absorbed into the reality of God, fully and beautifully.

May His Love continue to awaken you, my beloved brothers and sisters. This one great truth is the greatest truth in all the universe, and believe me, I have the authority to tell you so. I have seen much of God’s Creation. I acknowledge the power of His Love to transform, to create, to bring about wondrous things, and you have accepted this truth, acknowledged the power of this blessing. So you draw us and many others close, for the law enacts and assures this to be so.

Continue, my beloved friends, and be with God. Be open, receptive, acknowledging God, demonstrating the power of faith within you, and all will open in its glories, the flower, the miracle, the light that is your soul. God bless you, my beloved friends, and keep you well, in harmony and light, in love and joy. God bless you. I am Orion, your friend, always. God bless you.
