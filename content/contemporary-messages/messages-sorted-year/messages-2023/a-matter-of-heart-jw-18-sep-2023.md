John the Beloved received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I come, I am John. Yes, I am the apostle, also called the Beloved for my closeness to the master that was always a matter of heart. When you speak of feeling, when you speak of intuition, when you allow your heart, in whatever condition it may be, perhaps lonely, joyful, troubled, in love, when you allow it to be broken open, God touches your soul. For the love of God is indeed something that can be felt. 

It is one thing to have an intellectual understanding of the truths you have been given and to allow those truths to inspire you, to guide you through your day, and another to lift your thoughts above the earth plane and quite another to go into your soul longings. It is a matter of the heart, and you may have heard the words, *‘sacred heart’,* which means a heart transformed in Divine Love. The words heart and soul are often interchangeable, and it is said in truth that the heart is the gateway, the doorway to the soul. The deeper meaning being that the longings of the soul are expressed in the feelings of the heart. For the heart is the feeling center. It is the way one can perceive the love of God in one’s soul by the glow emanating from the soul through the heart. Thus, when one wants another to feel their way, they say, *‘Take heart’.* 
     
In the presence of God’s love, the holy presence, the heart is healed, the soul is lighted. Whenever you send out the longing from your soul, whenever it is sincere, the heart is opened. As you walk this world, keep your heart open, that your soul may spread the emanations and the glorious vibrations of God’s love to all. There is nothing greater. There is no material possession that could hold a candle to the light and love of God’s grace. Do not be concerned. 

Do not trouble yourself of how others perceive you because if you live this love, their souls will perceive it, regardless of whatever thoughts they may have. Your longings bringing this great gift from God touches every soul you come in contact with and when the time is right for them, they will go to that place in humility, in longing, in the asking for the love of God and they shall, as is your wish and the desire of God, they shall receive it. Be of good cheer, take heart, be lifted in song and praise and as the master said, love one another as I have loved you and you know he meant in the love of God. Go in peace. Go in grace. I am John, your brother in Christ. I love you.
