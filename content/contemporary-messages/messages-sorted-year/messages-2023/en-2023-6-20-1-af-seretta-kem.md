Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

Dear beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. From now to the time when you meet, I would suggest that you cultivate an environment of peace around you. A measure of quietude would be greatly beneficial to all of you, putting aside those stressors and conditions in your life that often carry your attention away from God. Cultivating light around you is most important at this time, for light will be your shield from the darkness of the world.  Light will bring to you the influences and love that will uplift you and uphold you, and in order to bring light, I suggest that you quiet your mind and cultivate your thoughts in the direction of God, that you make another step forward to live your life as an expression of God’s Love and Light that you carry within you, focusing upon your soul in all its beauty and simplicity, focussing upon your actions derived from love and a desire to serve in love and to put aside all judgements, all conditions which bring those aspects within you that are not in harmony with the Laws of Love.

I know as you live in this world of yours, such things are a challenge and they impose a certain restriction and discipline upon you. Yet indeed, these few weeks that you have between now and the time that we will meet together are crucial. It’s important that you cultivate these things that bring harmony and peace in your lives, though it is always the case that you bring these things into your life that will cultivate harmony and peace. But at this time, it is important to focus upon these elements, to truly withdraw from all conditions that are not in harmony and light, peace: To be in prayer as often as you might; to be true to the desires of your soul, rather than that of your material mind; to walk in the world as a light shining forth. For this is your protection, your insulation from the world.

I urge you to observe yourself as you go about your daily business, to monitor your thoughts and your actions in such a way that you correct those expressions that are not in alignment with love, to be truly a child of God filled with the joy of knowing God, the peace of having God, expressions of God around you and within you. We will be there to assist in this. Each of you has your special guides and each of you will know our presence in some form so that you are reassured that what you do and how you are in this time will be reinforced and blessed.

There is nothing more needed other than your desire to be in the light, to be in harmony with God’s Laws of Love, to not allow those wayward thoughts and actions impede this and to be truly in the grace of God, the harmony of God, the Love of God. When those intrusions come, be aware of your response. Have faith that God will protect you and that we will be close. Have faith that within the wisdom of your own soul is the appropriate and harmonious response to conditions that are not harmonious. Be true to that which is of light. Be awake to those patterns and conditions within you that are not light. Be strong in light. Be strong in your choices for light, and crave and seek out peace and the great gift of God’s Love. In this way, all will be well, and you will surely come together with great harmony and the peace that passes all understanding.

May God bless you, beloved souls, upon this journey of life, bringing to you all that is good, all that is in harmony, that your souls may shine in the Love of God and that that brightness may increase with each prayer, each day, each moment, that you may be a blessing in this world, truly one of God’s instruments of light. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem. My love for you is great. I continue to work with each one of you to help develop your gifts and the great gift that we all seek. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.
