# You Will Be Inspired by the Angels!

July 29<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Regarding Laurelville Retreat, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Mozart received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved and beautiful souls of the Earthly plane. I am Mozart and I am a Celestial being, one inhabiting the Celestial Kingdom. I'm sure it would not surprise you that we too have had our meetings and discussions about this time together. I have been assigned to help orchestrate, from our side of life, the blessings and upliftment of music that may be shared by and through you, my beloved friends.

I want to assure you that I will assign various angels to be with you as you do your performances and songs for your brothers and sisters. In so doing, I want you to realise that you will be uplifted and inspired as you take your place and share your music. It will be a spiritual experience for each one of you. It will be a spiritual experience for all in the Circles of Light.

So be assured, my beloved friends, that everything is well in hand and that there will be many blessings from many different angles and perspectives and efforts. You, beloved brothers and sisters, have great talent and abilities. You have been inspired within your souls to create music for this beautiful gathering.

I dare say you may be inspired further before the gathering to share something special with this gathering. So keep your ears open, my beloved friends. Listen for the musing of the angels and the Touch of God upon you, and wonderful and creative expressions using your talents and gifts will be forthcoming.

God bless you my friends. I am Mozart and I am deeply honored and privileged to be working with you all at this time. Ask for my help. Ask for inspiration from God. All will come to pass in the flow and beauty of God's Love. God bless you my friends. May His Love continue to awaken your gifts and bring your beautiful expressions to ever higher levels of beauty and refinement. God bless you and keep you in love.
