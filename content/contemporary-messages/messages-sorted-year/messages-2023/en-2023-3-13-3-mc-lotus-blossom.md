# Deep Blessing of Healing for Circle of Seven

March 13<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Lotus Blossom received by Maureen Cardoso

I come to you bringing healing energies, attending to you, assisting your body to flow more easily to allow the great blessings of the gift of your body to be able to release the stagnation, the accumulation of the emotional energies that are within you. This allows more freedom and expression of the grace of your soul, the wisdom, the truths, and the desire to flow more freely to your conscious awareness where there is a great presence, you notice the presence of your soul more easily.

These energies free the material concerns of your day-to-day ongoings where you can nurture your inner richness and the presence of the blessing of your soul in hearing its desires and allowing the flow of the nature of your soul to carry you throughout your day; being able to attend to the beauty that you are, to see in the many ways that God desires to flow through you, animating your life and bringing to you the many things that you need in the perfect timing they are needed. So, the presence of your soul is evident in such a way that peace and joy are your dominant expressions.

As you deepen in this ability to reside within the wisdom of your soul and its expression, this draws the wonderment of others observing your nature, creating a curiosity within them, and I would also say inspiring them, for they know you pray deeply for the grace of God’s Substance within you and they observe the workings of this Love and the changes that have occurred naturally over the years. This draws many to you and it allows God’s workings to inspire others which plants an awareness of a desire within them to have their soul blessed in such a way that they too can experience this Love, this joy, this deep peace.

It is indeed a great pleasure to be together again in this way. I bring my healing blessings to each one as I stand before you with you in your Circle of Light. May you receive deeply these healing blessings, a mighty inflowing of Divine Essence within your soul as you are cradled in the arms of God. I am Lotus Blossom. God bless you.
