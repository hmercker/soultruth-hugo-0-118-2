# You are the fulfilment of the Master's Mission on Earth 

December 18<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your brother in Christ. I am John, the one called The Baptist, the cousin of the Master, and a disciple. Those of you who know of my life as a harbinger of the mission of Jesus, where I preached fasting and repentance, being baptized in water, purification in the natural love, also know that I was a follower and recognized my dear cousin as Messiah. 

I tell you this, his presence upon the earth was not only a balm to the afflicted, but a light to the blind and peace to those who were troubled. The love that shown forth from his soul, the same love that you feel in your souls when you open to the blessing of the heavenly Father, shown forth from him. 

So, I come to you today with this message:  *"Jesus brought this love into the world on his walk with great simplicity, so you too can bring the love in your souls to all on your walk."* 

It does not require money. It does not require any of accruements of material things. But it does require time, time in prayer. One who reads the gospels, as interpolated and mistranslated as they became, can still see clear evidence of Jesus in prayer. For he often went out alone to be at one with God. He made time, and this time, short as it may have been, in retrospect of the years of his life; this time in prayer was paramount to his mission. He brought his troubles to the heavenly Father. He brought his questions, and he brought the longings in his soul, and was given not only the great love of God, this divine gift, but the assistance of many in spirit to show the world the outward signs of this grace through miracles, through parables, but above all, through the presence of the kingdom of heaven in their midst walking upon the earth. 
   
This circle that I come to tonight is an extraordinary event. For even though there are many around the world who have these soul aspirations and receive the Love of God, there are very few who formally meet in prayer that God may open up their souls to the great infilling of His love. And when we tell you that you make a difference, believe us, take this to heart, and like the Master, allow this love to humble you, that in service, you may bring the joy of this gift to this world. 
    
There are many words as there are many gods. My brother here calls them the tiny gods.<sup>1</sup> And as is said, *‘what is in your heart will lead to your treasure’.* So, we ask you, whatever you are engaged in, keep your heart open that God may touch your souls in everything you do. This is your walk on earth. We walk with you who have God’s love in your souls. Be not troubled. Allow this great gift to lift you in joy and allow it to bring you faith over fear. Allow it to bring the joy of your smile and the presence, the Holy Presence to all. For, as I was the harbinger of the Master’s mission, you represent the fulfilment of that mission. What a glorious thing!
     
So, I shall thank my brother here and step back in this beautiful prayer, in the love of God, and I thank you all, and I wish you the most beautiful, blessed season celebrating the birth of Divine Love on earth. May we all be one in God’s love. 
   
I am John. Go in peace, in the love of God.
