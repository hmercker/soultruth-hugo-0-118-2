# Invites DV12 to Come Together again in Person for Development

April 25<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Direct Voice, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Alec Gaunt received by Al Fike

May God bless you with a great inflowing of His Love. I am your friend Alec, Alec Gaunt. I wish to encourage each one of you in your efforts to work together and to seek for that elusive gift of Direct Voice, one which when I was on the Earth, we made efforts to accomplish but did not realise this gift because of my untimely death and the dispersion of the group that was engaged in this endeavour.

It is good that you come together in this way, a way that we could not do. Yet, with present day technologies it makes it possible for you to be together seemingly in the flesh. Indeed, there was a suggestion that you make within a certain day and evening, before you retire, to come together in the spirit world. I would certainly encourage this as well. But I also wish to encourage you to consider setting aside some time in the future where you may come together in the flesh, for this would be fortuitous.Certain developments and efforts can only be made when you are together in this way. You have each progressed and grown and are ready for another step in this evolution and development of Direct Voice. So, when the time is right and you all feel encouraged and guided to come together, then I would certainly suggest that you do so.

It is always powerful to create these Circles of Light in person. Certainly, what you have done in this way has its blessings and is powerful in its own right. But indeed, to come together physically allows for chemical interactions and spiritual bonding and fusing of energies in such a way that we cannot accomplish this in this way. So my friends, if you but sacrifice some time, possibly five days or a week together, it would be most fortuitous. I know you all live busy lives, but many of you are not so distant from this center point that you could not come together and be together.

Seek your guidance, my friends. Seek for the highest, always seek for the highest, and the great blessings of God’s Love and the great outcomes of His blessings will be manifest in your lives. You will not be in a state of want or deprivation, but indeed, God provides for you and protects you and brings you into the state of grace that you so long for and feel at home within. Each of you brings your special gifts, your unique personalities and souls. Together you make a great string of lights, a necklace of lights that makes possible a great variety of things, great variety of blessings that will flow through you as channels of light, and a great variety of blessings that will come to you as one single light in unity and harmony.

So I would suggest that some of you have felt drawn to come together and this is part of your guidance. This is a blessing that will be made manifest, provided you are willing and open and sense the power of the guidance to bring you together. When that power is strong, that longing continues to draw you close, then you know that the time is right, and the possibilities of gathering will be possible and probable. Of course, you have free will, my beloved friends. God will not circumvent this. So, each of you must be on board for this in your own way and in your own time.

So I suggest you continue to communicate and take time to establish a day, a date where you might do this gathering that is of God’s Will, not as great a time as was originally asked of you, but some time and some place. There is no need for the dark room, although if there is one available then that would be fortuitous, would help you in your perceptions and sensations together. This room that I sit within at this moment could be made into such a room. So I see there is a possibility of doing so, provided these two beautiful souls agree to make this a reality.

There is still much to do, my friends. This journey that never ends, these possibilities that multiply as you grow in the Father’s Love and the manifestations that can be through those instruments that are pure and in great alignment with God and the Truth of God’s Love. Oh, what can be manifest, my friends, what the possibilities might be if you all but come to that place where you are immune from the human condition and very much engaged in that which is of God, powerful instruments, powerful lights upon the world.

God needs these lights. God requires for those who are strong enough and dedicated enough to push forward, to release those conditions that are contrary to light and to His Love. Seek purity, seek upliftment, seek the highest for your souls, and God will ensure that what you require and what you long for will be given. It is a law and it shall be manifest in many ways, through many avenues, through many possibilities.

May God bless you on your journey, my beloved friends. I am Alec and I am happy to speak to you today and to be with you in this Circle of Light. God bless you and keep you in His Love, always. We are close. You are never without an angel by your side. You are always protected, and guidance may flow readily for those who will listen. God bless you. God bless you all. My love is with you.
