The time is here, that time that I saw and told to this dear and beloved son of his instrumentality and his ministry on the Earth. And it is not only for him, but is for the rest of you that you may indeed step forward and be that bright shining light as Matthew has told you to be. Each of you have many gifts and those gifts need their expression. Just like exercising a muscle, if it goes unused it becomes lost and ineffective. It must take time, my friends, my beloved children, to be that instrument that God intends for you to be, to not waste any time, but to be dedicated to service. For each of you, it is the last chapter of your life. It is the great window to service and to being God’s instrument in the world.

So I urge you to step forward, to be true to God’s Truth and to be that powerful link in the chain which began years ago and must be forged as you move forward in the world. For this truth cannot be lost, put aside, it must continue to be upheld in the world, and you carry the ways and means of doing so, my beautiful friends. So I urge you forward. I urge you to contemplate how you may do so, what you may do to help educate and bring many to the Truth of God’s Love, how you might be that instrument of light in the world, how you may be the individual that will bring the means of freedom from the tyranny of the human condition to others. God has a plan for each of you, for all souls, whether they be in the flesh or in spirit. It is for you to know that plan, to know your part within it and to be dedicated to this role, this journey that He wishes for you to take. For when you walk in this way, upon this path of service, the greatest joy and fulfilment will come in the acts of service that will result from your dedications.

May God bless you on that path, my beloveds, for you are truly my beloveds. May we all be in harmony, the closeness, the bond of love that continues to grow so that we may serve together, that when you serve, know that many are with you in that service. I will be with you in that service and help you to bring forth what is intended, God’s intention for the moment, the fulfilment of the opportunity that God has laid before you, the realisation of another step in the plan expressed and implemented. Oh, my beloveds, how I love you, how I know you and how I am close to each of you and will be for all the days of your life. I will be there and I will love you and pray for you and add the power of my love to yours and God’s so it may flow powerfully and beautifully in the world. God bless you, beloveds. I love you. I love you. I love you. God bless you and keep you in His Love forever.
