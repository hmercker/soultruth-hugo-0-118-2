# Be Still

I am here Yogananda. I come in the love of God, your brother in Christ. 
    
Be still that you may feel the Presence of God. This is great wisdom and yet you see everything is in motion. From planets to the atoms and molecules in your body, from the microcosmic to the macro all is alive. Your heart is beating, your brain is active and there are millions of interactions going on within and without at the very least. And yet, when you bring your heart and the longings in your souls to this circle there is a great stillness. There is a beautiful light descending from heaven on each one. 

It is only required that you ask, that you allow God to fill you with His love in the stillness of this moment, in Grace and in peace. When thoughts arise, allow the love to dissolve any distance, any doubt. Allow your heart to open that you may blossom in the blessing of this space, this sacred circle, this lattice of light embracing the world. Send love, be love, speak love, sing love, walk in love, work in love, rejoice in love. Awake in gratitude for this great gift is yours, is mine, is for all for the asking. Be still. 
     
We Praise God from Whom all blessings flow. I shall step back and be with you in His glory. I am your brother and eternal friend in the love of God. I am Yogananda. God bless you.
