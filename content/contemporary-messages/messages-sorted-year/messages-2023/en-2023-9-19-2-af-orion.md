Orion received by Al Fike

…of God’s creation, be yours, my beloved friends. I am Orion. I have been spending much time with this instrument as we are engaged on a project to write a book together. This has been going well, although he could be more disciplined in his time to do so. But this will be accomplished as we forge ahead in this project and he feels the joy, the upliftment of our collaboration. The ease of writing comes because of his skills and our inspiration, so as to write clearly and beautifully a novel that hopefully will be read by many, a novel full of seeds of inspiration, seeds of truth, that the reader may absorb and come to understand in time.

You see, there are many ways in which we may work to uplift and inspire humanity. It is not just one way. It is not just one path, but many paths converging upon the truth as each individual soul seeks it and does so in their unique way. This is the way of God’s creation and God’s plan. He does not insist on uniformity and conformity to certain approaches and ideas. But rather, He opens the door to truth that might come in, depending upon the desires and efforts of the individual.

Of course, the truth in all its simplicity, can be had by every individual. Because it does not require great dissection or intellectualism. It is merely the perceptions of the soul awakening to God and all that comes with this as God infills that soul with His Love or, at the very least, purifies that soul through the experiences and influences that may come through these desires. The world is a multi-dimensional and diverse place and, as I have said before, the diversity is somewhat unique for your world. Our world is not nearly as diverse, though we have many individuals who, indeed, walk their own path. But because of the harmony that exists in our world, there is a great uniformity of thought and understanding that tends to bring individuals in unity in their thoughts and their actions.

Your world suffers from great chaos, but also is blessed with great diversity. It is interesting for us to observe such a place as this. We feel many emotions with these observations. In some cases, we have great empathy and sympathy for those who suffer. In other situations, there is great joy and laughter as to the antics of humanity in this world. We feel as if we are your elder brothers and sisters seeking to uphold you, to guide you, to uplift you, to be in the great grace and flow of God, the Light of God, the Love of God, is to be a channel for God’s Will and plan. In doing this and being a part of this, we have great joy, fulfilment, in the role that we play.

So much comes with the dedications and fellowship that we forge with you, between ourselves and all of you who are seeking, who are hungering, who are thirsting for the truth. Of course, there are many, many bright spirits and angels, all manner of influence and beings that are drawn because you have hit upon a great truth. You come to practice this truth, to understand it thoroughly and fully, to bring it into your hearts, minds and souls. Through these efforts, the Law of Attraction brings the beings of light, the influence of truth and love around you. As you move in the world, so we move with you and we attempt to influence those you are in connection with, those upon your path.

It is a great and complex work, moving with you in such a world as this, electing to be that channel of truth and love, bringing clarity, light, peace, healing, and truth to many. It is very challenging to us, for we are not used to the conditions of your world. We live in great harmony in ours. It is difficult to adjust to these conditions and to be effective within these conditions. As with you, we have the great benefit of God’s Touch, His blessings upon us. This strengthens us, strengthens our resolve, strengthens our gifts and capacities to move as God’s instruments. It is a learning experience for us, just as it is for you, my friends, as we continue to perceive, to understand, to express all that we are in this world of yours. It is a great gift and many great blessings come as a result of this gift, this invitation that has been given to us, to help you all in a world so in need of light, harmony and love.

My beautiful and beloved friends, we are all given great gifts and blessings. We are all given much because we have opened ourselves to God’s Will and plan. We are willing partners in this plan and we seek to know the Will of God with all clarity and depth of understanding and knowledge as it comes. It trickles forth to us, to you and to all those who are in alignment with it. My beloved and beautiful friends, we seek unity. We seek harmony. We seek to come together as a powerful force for change, transformation, healing, light, harmony.

We are together, are we not? We will continue to be together as long as you are upon the Earth. We continue with our dedications and our connections with you and, indeed, much will be accomplished. This I assure you, my friends. For as you have been told many, many times, there is much coming. Great change is in the air. Great opportunities for spiritual awakening and growth are coming. You will come to know us as your true friends, substantial and real in your life. As you will with others, so you will with us work together, be together, and the flow of love shall be powerful, transformative.

How blessed we are, how interesting is life in God’s creation. Many things come unanticipated, but a great blessing nonetheless. Much is given. Much may be received, much expressed. Much change may come within your consciousness, within your being, beloved souls, as you seek ever greater of that blessing from God. May God bless you in His Love, keep you in His Light, and ensure that we will be friends, cohorts in the great work ahead for the awakening of humanity and the transformation of your world. God bless you. I am Orion. My love is with you, my dear friends. Truly, deeply, my love is with you. God bless you.
