# In God’s love and Gratitude

April 24<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  


I am here, your friend Joseph. I wish to express my deep gratitude as well as my delight that the work that I did while on earth in publishing messages<sup>1</sup> from a variety of sources all connected in the oneness of God’s love, lives on. I must say that this was a great worry of mine, that whatever I had done on earth might bring to naught in spirit. So, I can tell you that this is no longer a concern of mine, and I am so gloriously happy in my progression to the Celestial heavens. Not quite there yet, but ever closer. I thank you for championing these books, these messages and taking them to heart as I did. 
   
I wish you to express my love, my everlasting love for humanity but in particular, for my dear children. Please draw them into your hearts and let them know I watch over them with not only the love of a father but with the love of the Heavenly Father. 
   
Again, I thank you for all that you do. You will not regret a single moment of prayer, of study, of turning to God, of walking in His love, and of sharing the great truths that you have been so blessed to be given. How wonderful to share these truths. I give you all a great big hug and send my love to all in the divine love community, my family, and friends, and to the earth. May all souls be blessed in the love of God. With all my love, I bid you farewell for now, but I shall come again. I am your brother in Christ, Joseph Babinsky. God bless you.
