# Will Be Praying with Soul Links

March 30<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike  



I am Joan. (Joan of Arc) I was martyred many years ago for my beliefs but now I have come to the Celestial Kingdom and reside there with all its glories and beauties and joys. I come today to make my commitment, beloved souls, that you who join together who wish to continue to do the work of the Master and bring the truths to the world. I come to say that I will join you. I will be with you in prayer as will many angels of the Celestial Heavens, that as you pray you are not alone but you are with many, many who are a great light and great love. And so we shall surround you, beloveds. We shall be with you as the master calls us forth. So we answer this call as God blesses us as we gather with you and so, we are a channel of love for you and bring our light and protection and upliftment. 

So God blesses all of us upon this blessed day, that we may know the freedom and joy of a soul redeemed by the Essence of God. I shall be with you, my friends. I long that all the peoples of the world would know the joys that I know, the truth that I know, the experience of His love that is a constant and growing light within me and within the Celestial Kingdom, that you may all join me one day and we may sing our prayers, express our love and be within the joy, so deep and intense that the bliss will be forever. I love you, beloveds. I am Joan and I love you. God bless you. God bless you all.
