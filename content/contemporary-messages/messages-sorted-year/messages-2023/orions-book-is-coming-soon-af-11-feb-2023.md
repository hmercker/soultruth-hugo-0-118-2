I wish to confirm this instrument’s ideas and impressions as to how we may communicate the information which we wish to give to the world about ourselves, our planet on which we live, the possibilities of life that exist on other planets and can exist on yours provided humanity lifts itself up from the quagmire of this condition which you live within. Our plan is to create something that is easily read and absorbed and is not entirely controversial. Rather, because we plan to make this a work of fiction, it can be read with an open mind. Yet, in so reading this information, there will be seeds planted and ideas ingested within the mind of the individual reader.

This effort may develop into a series of books. Essentially, it will be a conversation between myself and this instrument written in such a way that information that would be difficult to accept and ingest, be put aside so that the reader will read with interest and intrigue rather than the insistence that they must believe that this work is non-fictional. When this instrument returns home and is settled into his new home, we will begin. He will feel inspired and it will be a joyful experience creating this novel. It is our hope that through doing so, some recognition will come to him and some remuneration as well so that he and his dear wife may continue with their work unimpeded by financial pressure.

We cannot guarantee such success but between ourselves and this instrument, we will put great focus and effort into creating something that has a wide interest among people of the Earth plane. This would not be difficult to accomplish on our part. But indeed, this instrument must be in the right condition and receptivity in order for the process to be successful and the writing well-constructed to not only entertain but to intrigue and as I say, plant seeds of truth within the individual who reads these books. Much can be accomplished in a short time. We will add our efforts and energies to his efforts and energies so that this may indeed flow and be completed in a short period of time. 

It should not be difficult given the resources available, this instrument’s receptivity and instrumentality, and our abilities to impress and to create with this beautiful instrument. So, we wait for the time that is right and the conditions that are in harmony but it is coming very soon indeed. We have been given permission from our beloved brother Jesus to take this time together with him. So, it will be a blessed time, an interesting time, a time of intrigue. We wish to add many components to this book, humour, insight, truth, and descriptions of how we live on our planet which we have designated to be called Orion. Although, as this instrument well knows, it is not truly a planet within the Orion system but is far beyond that.

So, surprises come, do they not? Intrigue and interest as one’s life unfolds and is receptive to the Will of God and the workings of spirit and angels to bring about greater light to the world. So much is dependent upon the individual and their receptivity, their progression, their intention, and their desire. These things come as they grow in Love, in ability, and in gifts. So, we shall see what we might create together, the unfolding of a plan that is somewhat unusual but indeed can be a great boon to all of you and to this world. 

In times to come, I believe that this instrument may reveal his sources and indicate that it is not truly a work of fiction but a collaboration between his ability and capacity to write and our sharing of truth so that those who have read this novel will be able to understand its source and the truth within it. These things shall come in time, my friends, in a time when many things will manifest and much intrigue and surprising outcomes will be the case in your life and the life of this Earth of yours.

Yes, as you have been told over and over again, there is a great need for focus, dedication, and effort in order to realize this great plan, divinely guided and orchestrated. Many blessings will come to you all. Much assistance is given freely. Indeed, it is for you to follow your guidance, to understand what it is that is required and expected of you. As you follow the course that God has designated for you and do so with true dedication, then there will be leaps and bounds of spiritual progression among you all and your life will be dynamic and filled with joy.

May God bless you upon this journey of yours and may all that is good come to you and through you. There are many in need in the world, as you well know. There are many who are crying out, as you well know. Indeed, given harmony and balance and a willingness to serve, then these needs will be met in a way that is in harmony with God’s Laws of Love. You will not find yourself drained or pressured or feeling inadequate or a failure. These things do not exist in God’s universe. There is only harmony and greater harmony and greater harmony. 

As the universe progresses toward this goal, so you will find this to be true in your life. You will find yourselves in joyful bliss and awareness of love, expanding out within you and through you into the world. It is the way of God. It is universal. You are beginning to understand the ways of God and the universe of His creation. May God bless you, my friends, and keep you in His Light and Love, peace, harmony, joy, and all things of light. God bless you. I am Orion. I am glad to speak to you today. This beloved instrument and I will forge a very intense relationship of mutual service and an outpouring of truth as we progress along this particular path together. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.
