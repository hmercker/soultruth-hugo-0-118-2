# The Importance of What Each Individual Brings to the Circle

Laurelville, PA, U.S.A. (Pre Retreat)

Yes there is a chemistry to the proximity of each individual to the other individual and what they emanate compared to what the other emanates. At times when these energies are blended together, it precipitates a different energy altogether, one that often is very beneficial in terms of blending these energies with one another. So, the way in which you sit together in circle, how you are together in prayer, is important because it makes for a harmonious condition. The emanations of each soul intermingling with the other souls create wondrous outcomes and blessings that can be utilised in many different ways.

When you pray together and you feel and sense that you must sit with this person or that person, it is for a reason. It helps to create a condition, a spiritual condition, that is beneficial to you and to them and to all in the circle. This is not always necessary, for sometimes prayers are simple heartfelt longings to God and have the purpose and desire to receive the great Love of God. This is, indeed, a high calling and an effort that is not wasted. 

But when you come together for a purpose, possibly to bring healing to the world, to bring upliftment and benefit to one and another within the circle, then, where you sit, how you comport yourself within the circle, the thoughts you have, what you are emanating at the time, your spiritual condition, plays a large part in what may come of your efforts together. These are on many different levels. For in the material level there is a chemistry, as you are well aware. On the spiritual level there is a chemistry. On the soul level there is a sort of chemistry, although it is very different from the other two.

Indeed we wish for you to be aware of the soul, its interactions soul to soul, its interactions with God. For this is where the greatest light is created, the most powerful chemistry is accomplished. As you continue to be awakened to the soul awareness and aspects of the soul, then you will become attuned to these chemistries, if I may call it that, of the soul, the energetic interactions between soul to soul. These are the interactions that are most important, that bring the greatest of blessings. Although often you are merely aware of the spiritual chemistry, that of the metaphysical. This is important as well. 

As for the material, being in harmony together, loving, honouring one another, helps to clear away any obstructions and conditions that may cause difficulties among you. As these levels come into alignment and the chemistries are in harmony, you are, indeed, in sync with one another. Then many, many beautiful blessings may flow, not only to you but through you, among you and out into the world. 

Think of these things, my beloved, beautiful friends. What is it that you bring into a circle? What are your thoughts at this moment? What are your conditions at this moment? What is the longing within you at this moment? These things help to bring alignment and harmony among you. Be aware,as awareness is the key. For if you sit in ignorance, your minds are not in attunement with your soul and spirit. Then, rather than contribute much to the circle, you are receiving and benefiting, but it is important that you also become in alignment with what is required, what is needed at this time.

Although we do not expect you to know all of the aspects of this interchange, interconnection of various souls within a circle, it is important that you know within yourself the condition that you carry. Be aware of the thoughts that you have. Be aware of your physical condition, your spiritual condition, your soulful condition. In this way, our hope is that you make efforts to bring these aspects of yourself in alignment, but also in alignment with the highest blessing and endeavor to serve, to be with God in service, to be at peace together and open so that all may come together, flourish together in harmony and light. 

When you come together in this way it is not a casual thing. There is always work to do, my beloved brothers and sisters. There is always the possibility of what may be accomplished. There is always the Will of God working and bringing through each of you and collectively, an outcome that will bring greater light and greater harmony among you and into the world. Many layers and levels, my beloved friends, much that can be accomplished through your efforts and prayers coming together in harmony and love. 

As you begin this circle that will grow and grow, implement your awareness and your efforts towards light, harmony and love. You will be rewarded and others will be rewarded. For many do not understand these concepts, they are not mature enough to perceive and know these things. It is for you to know and perceive, my beloved brothers and sisters. It is for you to be a part of this great circle that has in it many moving parts, many dynamics, many aspects, many layers. We may utilise you to smooth out the rough patches, so to speak, to calm the waters, to bring greater harmony and peace, to help open the many who will be amongst you and to truly be in alignment with God's Will. 

Much work to do and much responsibility to carry, but indeed you are each up to the task. You each have special gifts. You give something unique to this circle and to one another, strengthening and bringing forth powerful blessings through your instrumentality, through the instrumentality of the angels and the Touch of God upon all of this. 

May God bless you, beloved souls, keep you in light, keep you in harmony, keep you guided and intended towards the highest blessings and outcomes. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem and I love you, each, beautiful souls filled with so much potential. So many unique gifts that are given in love, that God has created these unique flowers, so beautiful, ready to burst forth in love, light and beauty. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you all. My love is with you.
