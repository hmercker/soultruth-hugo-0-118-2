# Guidance

I am here, your sister in Christ, Eileen Caddy, Aunty Eileen. 
  
Before the creation of the community that I founded along with Peter and Dorothy, called Findhorn, there was guidance. I was chosen to receive instructions. All of which, from the point of view of the material mind seemed unfathomable and yet to those who listened to what I received and felt the hand of God and the guidance that came through the messages I received, they heard. To those came faith, came a trust nearly unshakable, and before our very eyes and the eyes of the world, blossomed a thriving, sustainable, spiritually founded community. 
   
They say great minds think alike, small minds differ. But in reality, most of the great minds of inventors will tell you that through all their struggles came a momentary flash, a lightbulb, an idea they had not considered. Some of them even acknowledging that this information must have come from spirit, and so indeed I can tell you it did. Most, if not all of the great inventions and co-creations that have changed the lives of those on earth in innumerable ways, came from guidance. Souls in the spirit world informing the so-called great minds. Myself, despite delving into metaphysics, mysticism, spiritualism, and all of the esoteric teachings of my day, I came from a very limited or parochial school of thought, and this informed much of what I received, however blessed it was. And as I have said before, if one reads between the lines of the prayers, of the guidances, you shall find the asking for divine love, the asking for the infilling, inflowing of Godâ€™s grace, and the asking to be in the will of the Creator. 

For though my mind may have had a limited perspective, when my soul was open, truth came through and, on this truth, on this foundation, was built a community. I tell you these things because you are a community, or may I say you are several communities consisting of many diverse schools of thought, cultures, belief systems, and yet here you are, in prayer to receive guidance from us, to receive the great love of God, to allow your souls to be informed, that your minds may receive and you may bring about a new world based on love and peace and sustainability and all the aspirations of every blessed soul not only upon the earth, but in the celestial heavens. When you allow this guidance, when you allow the love of God to inform your minds in your daily walk, you co-create with us and with God above a new world. 
  
I wish for you, not only a coming together in this way through this medium but that you come together and gather in person, with each other as often as possible. For, although you are a church without walls, without the limitations of so many other communities and groups, you are one in the love of God. With God, all things are possible. May your community be ever-blessed, ever-growing, ever-loving, everlasting. I am your sister and celestial friend and I thank you. May God bless you. I am Eileen Caddy. Go in peace.
