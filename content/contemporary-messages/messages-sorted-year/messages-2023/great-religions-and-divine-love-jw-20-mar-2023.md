I am here, your brother in Christ. I am Judas. I come as promised and I will speak to all those here and beyond on the subject of world religions and Divine Love and their relationship. In what are called the great religions, there are many followers, and these religions have over time, millenniums, absorbed more primitive or shall I say natural beliefs. There are many “isms” – pantheism, that all is God, or panentheism, which is God directing all; deism, one God, yet removed;  as well as animism; anthropomorphism; monotheism; trinitarianism, and the list goes on. All these have been in some ways absorbed by what are called the great religions, or shall we say organized religion. You have discovered the great truth, the essence behind all longing, behind every souls’ desire to connect to that which is Source, The Creator. You have been exposed to the truths of Divine Love and you have, some of you, discovered that these truths have also been disseminated through not only James Padgett, Dr. Stone, Dr. Samuels, and their contemporaries, Reverend Owens, Robert Lees, to name a few, but continue to be made clear through contemporary mediums as well. 
       
If one examines the writings of all religions after the coming of Jesus who brought the great truth of God’s love and the availability to humankind, you can find in many, many places, not only religions honoring the master’s teaching but  absorbing it.  And while the world has had and continues to have sages dispensing great wisdom and how to live in harmony with the world, how to feel oneness with the universe, how to interact with love, compassion, empathy, you also have had the great saints, as you call them. Those souls whose focus was simply to be at one with their Creator and regardless of their beliefs, received this Divine Love, regardless of the errors and fallacies in their traditions, their souls were lifted above these beliefs and changed, and thus their lives are honored in every tradition around the world because they emanated the Love of God while on earth.  

So consider this: there is a tremendous diversity of beliefs, some true, some in error. And then there are those who, taking a more fundamentalist approach have come with intolerance and the world has suffered much from this kind of harmful and often violent approach from misguided souls. So, how then in the midst of all this incongruity can one not only live a life in the love of God, but share it with the many? This is not a thought, or a consideration only made here in the divine love community as you know it, but made everywhere around the world with those who have felt God’s Love. And though you may disagree on the beliefs, is it not true that even among this group, there are many disagreements? These may be political differences, they may be  differences in lifestyle, or they may simply be how one comprehends the truths that were given to by the Master and continue to be given through this one and others, and yet is there not one common denominator, the great Love of God?  

If you take this as your template; if you take this circle as an example of a variety of approaches and beliefs, coming together in the longing for God’s presence, for God’s Love, for the company of the celestials, for the transformation of souls, it all comes down to love. This is true. It is written *“God is love”* and though God is more, that is enough. So, rather than get caught up in all the various beliefs and things that seem to be in opposition, remember when you are in your soul, when you are in the grace of God, those things have no weight. We have said that God’s love is anti-gravitational, and so it is. It is above the world and yet embraces it. It is above all the 'isms' and yet embraces them. As you love one another as God loves you, you carry this truth to the world. You may do it through words, you may do it through song, dance, any of the arts, or a simple kindness of feeding a hungry person with love that feeds a hungry soul and in giving, you receive much, so much more. 
      
I thank my brother for taking this message. He generally prefers to receive something simpler and so despite varying towards a bit of intellectualism in trying to inform as I did with the brother from Ecuador, you can see that everything gets distilled down to the one great gift, the oneness of every soul in the love of God. 
   
May this blessing from our glorious Creator be upon all. I thank you. I love you. We all do. I am your brother in Christ and your guide. I am Judas, once from Kerioth, now an inhabitant of the celestial kingdom. May God bless you.
