# Follow your heart

It is I Care. What a beautiful prayer from a beautiful soul! 
 
So many practical considerations in the earth life requiring that material things need to be taken care of, considered, and paid for as well as medical issues and so forth. I would suggest to you that very simple phrase, “Follow your heart!” For where the heart leads you, love follows. And that and most especially the love of God which transcends the material question. For there is always help available on the material plane there is always protection available . Have you not been all cared for beautifully despite your worries and concerns all has worked to your advantage. All trials and tribulations have led you to prayer. 
 
For my grandson I say this. Not only should you follow your heart but allow your dreams their fulfillment. For though you may think they are too extreme, or that you are not worthy,  or simply that they are just out of reach, that is not true. The more you follow your heart, the more you pray for guidance and for the love of God the more your dreams can come true. And then the pathway opens as if by magic and you will look back not in disbelief but in wonder. May all your wishes come true and even those that are not answered on the earth I assure you, will be answered in the heavens. 
   
All of your souls are humble and wish to serve each in their own way and according to their means. For example, for someone with a limited amount of material possessions to give even a small thing can be a great act of kindness. Remember for all according to their means, and to not be afraid to ask for whatever you may need. Remember this is how you have arrived at this station. This station of answered prayers, this station of stillness, just to be, in the longing for God’s love. Just to stop the world for one moment and allow God to lift you up. Is this not your greatest wish? All else is icing on the cake. 
 
With all my love and blessings and in the love of God. I wish you every good and perfect gift my dear ones. I love you. I am your Care. May God bless you.
