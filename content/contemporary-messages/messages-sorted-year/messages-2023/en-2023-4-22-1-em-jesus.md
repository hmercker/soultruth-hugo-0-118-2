Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Jesus and I come to pray with you and to uplift you and to let you know that your prayers will all be answered. For it is the Love of God that creates these changes within you and brings you closer, closer to Him. You are being uplifted and protected in being given more guidance to help you along your path. All these things and more are coming to you at this time in your prayers, so open wide for the Father’s Love is pouring into you now. Open wide and come into this River of Love.We bring you closer. You may feel the peacefulness, calmness, the joy, the presence of this Love that you may seek the truth now and always, and express it to your brothers and sisters in ways in which they will receive it and it is their choice to accept it.

Behold the Love of your Father as He gifts you with your intentions fulfilled in support from your brothers and sisters upon the Earth to help you and those in the Celestial Heavens and even friends from far away. Behold all that God has given to you and will continue to give to you in support of your missions upon this Earth, that you may see all that you have been given.

God bless you. God bless you. I love you. I am your brother, Jesus. You know me as the Master of the Celestial Heavens. I will welcome you to the kingdom when it is time. I love you.
