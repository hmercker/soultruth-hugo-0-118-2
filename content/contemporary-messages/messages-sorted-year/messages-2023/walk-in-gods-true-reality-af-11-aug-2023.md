God bless you, my beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine. Yes, we urge you to walk in a different world, a world of true reality, a world that God has created so that your perceptions and your understanding of life may be in greater alignment with God’s intentions and creation for life. 

You are subject to many mindful ideas and conditions that you have absorbed from the beginning of your incarnation upon the Earth. Thus humanity has gone to great effort to condition you to a reality of its own making, and in some ways, it is our effort and desire to decommission this reality within you and to help you absorb and adopt the reality of God.  It is a difficult road to travel. It requires great determination, discipline and prayer. Many of you falter along the way, injuring your pride, injuring your egos and your set determinations from the mind so that you often compromise and exclaim in frustration that you are not able to follow this road so willingly or completely. 

Yet indeed, with the help of our efforts, God’s Touch and your will, you pick yourselves up and you continue upon the road, that road less traveled, as our dear daughter exclaims. Indeed, it is less traveled. Yet would you travel the road of humanity or the road of God? I would say that since you are here in prayer together, you desire the road of God, you desire that the reality of God be open to you, that the perceptions of your soul may know this road well and recognise it as the road to eternal salvation. 

My beloved students, every day gives you an opportunity to learn. Every day gives you the opportunity to set aside the old ways, the old perceptions, the old understanding of life and embrace the new. That sense of newness is only within you, my beloved souls. For in truth, it is not a new reality. It is the reality that has been here and shall be here for all eternity. Rather, it is a choice to embrace it, to honour it, to explore it, to have within you an excitement, a joy, a desire to be with God and to embrace the reality of God. 

Are you able to do so, my beloved brothers and sisters? At times you find it an easy road, a gratifying road. At other times it is difficult and, to your mind, often unrewarded. But to your soul, my beloved, beautiful students, it brings the greatest rewards, it brings the most beautiful blessings, it brings the reality of God. As you continue to seek at-onement with God, seeking the blessing of His Love within your souls, seeking all that God has to give to you, so the rewards will multiply. That feeling of gratitude and joy, upliftment and expansion will grow exponentially as you allow the power of God’s Love to transform you, to transform your reality into that which is of God, that which is in harmony with God’s Laws of Love, that which brings you the perceptions and understanding of truth, that which brings us close and for you, an understanding and awareness of our presence. 

All of these things come to the soul who is penitent, who desires to release those conditions that are not in harmony with God’s Laws of Love and to be true to your soul’s desire, your soul’s urging, your soul’s longing for God. So, it shall be, beloved students. You shall walk this road, that road less traveled, that road filled with surprises, filled with blessings, filled with joy, filled with healing and most of all, filled with love. 

God bless you, beloved students. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I come to speak to you of God’s Truth and God’s Love and all that comes with His blessings and I love you. God bless you. God bless you, beloved souls.
