Barbara Davies received by Elizabeth Mack

I am your friend, Barbara and I am so very happy to see you here. I come with blessings for all of you and for each of my dear, dear friends. I love you dearly. So pleased to be here with you today on this adventure. I watch you often and notice how well you are progressing and how this work is unfolding for each of you. You are indeed special creations, specially blessed by the Father. I am so happy to see you. I love you dearly and God is so pleased and what you have accomplished thus far. But you are not done yet. As you know, there is more to do, much more. So hang onto your hats because there is much more coming, blessings, many blessings, some challenges and so much more love and guidance that you will be getting. I am so pleased and proud of you. I love you, as you know, so dearly. I must go now but I thank this dear instrument for allowing me to come and tell you again how much I love you. I am Barbara and I embrace you with my love. So happy to see you. God bless you. Thank you for this. I hope you are enjoying my sweater. God bless you all.
