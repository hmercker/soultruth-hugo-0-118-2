Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloveds, I come with a blessing, a blessing of peace and comfort for each of you, a blessing that you may carry into the world, a blessing that is needed upon the Earth. I come to touch each of you. My hand rests upon you, beloveds. I am your brother and friend. I am Jesus and I am with you in your struggles and triumphs and all that you do. Know that I am your friend and I am with you. May God bless you deeply, beloved souls, and keep you in His Light and protection and Love. The angels are with you and I am close and I love you, each one precious to my heart, each one beautiful and loved by God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you. I love you. Peace be upon you. And may you settle in the grace of God, opening your souls to His touch of love. God bless you.
