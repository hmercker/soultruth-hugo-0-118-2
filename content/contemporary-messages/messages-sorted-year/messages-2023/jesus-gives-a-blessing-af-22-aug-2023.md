May the peace that passes all understanding be yours, my beloved brothers and sisters. I come, I am Jesus. I come to be with you in prayer, to bring a blessing of peace for each one of you. With my prayers combined with yours, that God may touch you deeply within your souls. 

Each time you reach out beyond yourself to that great and wondrous Soul that is God, there is a response, a Touch that is given that cleanses the soul. In time it will transform the soul to something that is closer to the Divine. My beloved brothers and sisters, prayer is the antidote to suffering, to those feelings of loss, confusion, and pain. Prayer is the antidote to a soul that is in a state of disarray and darkness. Prayer is the key that will open the door to the Kingdom of God. I urge you all to pray, beloved souls, pray for the Touch of God, for it comes with your longing and desire. It comes without judgment or restriction. It comes because you have asked, because you long for this gift. My beloved friends, you are deeply blessed. 

God longs for you to be in alignment with His great Soul. God longs for you to live your life in harmony with His laws of love. God longs for you to come to know Him, for each of you has the capacity to do so. Each of you has a soul, that magnificent gift that is given to every human being in your world. It is for you to discover its qualities, the treasures that lie within, the capacity of the soul to know and understand the truth, to receive the unlimited Love of God and to continue to be healed, transformed by this blessing. Truly be the children of God, innocent, yearning, seeking and having great faith in the power of His Touch, for you are all His children. We are all His children. We gather together and walk this road toward further enlightenment, awakening and transformation. 

Those of us who are further along the road are all too willing to walk with you. We are there for the asking. We are there because we love you. We are there because God has ensured that the barriers be broken and pushed aside so that light may be shed upon each one of you. That as you seek, so your prayers, longings and desires will be met with love and upliftment. 

My beloveds, you are precious to God and you are precious to us. Seek the gift that awakens the soul and seek to be in alignment with all that is of God's creation. You will find your way along this endless road of true redemption, healing and peace. 

My love is with you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I am with you. We shall walk together for all eternity. God bless you. I love you. God bless you in the great peace and the great love and light of His presence. Open yourselves and receive this gift. God bless you. God bless you all in this world of yours.
