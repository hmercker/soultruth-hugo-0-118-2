# Allow God’s love to permeate your day, and illuminate your night!

October 9<sup>th</sup>, 2023

My dear friends. It is I, your brother Judas, watching over what you may consider a small, but what I call a dedicated gathering. A group of souls committed to being in communion. Each gentle soul reaching out, reaching up, and opening to the love of God. Each one brings a certain amount of baggage to the gathering. Each one brings the aspects of their culture, perhaps their language, their mode of being and yet, you see, whenever one steps back from their outer world and opens up their heart, there is oneness. The grace of God penetrates the outer shell and illuminates the soul in the oneness of Divine love. 

You have heard it said that life is what happens to you while you’re making plans or some such thing. And yet when you allow the influence of God’s love, everything changes. You are able to be guided and your free will aligns with the great will of God. Not in subservience, but in harmony. And no matter what you chose when one is in a state of grace, it will be in harmony and all things will flow smoothly and without struggle. The soul begins to see the workings of God and the angels because, in grace, you allow for the miraculous, as you would call it, to permeate your day, to illuminate your night. When one is in the grace of God, questions dissolve in truth, clarity becomes paramount with all things, in harmony. 
   
What a different world this would be if even humans lived in the natural love, in the oneness of humankind, in the love of humanity, in kindness. This is no small order and yet you know now that because you have chosen to be at one with your Creator, in the greatest gift of God’s love, you can embrace all. From the vilest sinner and the great celebrities to the aspiring saint, knowing each soul is precious, each life is sacred. 
  
So, on this occasion, with so much anticipation in the air, I would recommend for all, whether they are attending this gathering<sup>1</sup> or connecting from afar, to allow; allow humor, allow joy, allow God to touch you. In the oneness of His grace, there is indeed no separation and no distance too great. There is no longing that is not responded to. Whatever your situation, allow what they say in AA groups, *“Let go and let God”.* This is a such good and profound statement. This is  the actual requirement in prayer, along with the aspiration of each soul and it's longing to be at one with God. This desire, coupled with the letting go and as I say, the allowing, brings the great love of God into your soul, whether you think you are alone or in the company of many. For, in the grace of God, you are surrounded by angels. Each one willing to come as I have and assist you. ‘Ask and you shall receive. Knock and the door will be opened’. As my brother sang and the master said so long ago, these words are still resonant, still truthful, and still potent. 
   
Rest assured, we shall protect all, we shall stay with you whether you are at home or on your journey. The potential for a Pentecostal blessing is always there if you allow it, and I feel that you will. Thank you. I am happy to speak tonight. Though you feel you are small, this group, there are many. There are many. May God bless you with a great inflowing of His love. I am your brother in Christ, your eternal friend on the path of divine love.
   
I am Judas. Go in peace!
