# The Road Ahead

December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, your brother in Christ, Judas. 
   
My dear friends, do not be troubled. I have noticed that in your community, there has been a plethora of information given about earth changes, about what one might expect, guidance to stay in prayer, promises of protection, and yet we here feel the deep concern that not only this blessed group has for what you call times of transition, but of many around the globe. There is a sense of helplessness. There is a sense of defeat. It is as if we have failed somehow in honoring the gift we have been given, in honoring Mother Earth. While there is much truth in all these things you have heard concerning earth changes, if these are the only voices that you listen to, you may continue to be concerned, and we do not wish this, and certainly, our Heavenly Father does not wish this. 
    
You have been given encouragement to go deep and be in prayer that you may be in a state of grace. You have been given encouragement from brother Noah to create arks as he called them and to follow your guidance in this regard from what you have been told and master Jesus asking you to create places of refuge for the many and to do this as if you were preparing your house for guests. Now, of course you can take this on a purely spiritual level, your soul being the sanctuary of God’s love, a place of refuge and you would be absolutely correct in thinking so, in feeling so. 

At the same time, because you are inhabitants of the earth, it is only human that you should wonder will I be safe? Will my community be sustained? Will the message of God’s love and the truths we have been given continue? I have a few suggestions for you my dear ones. My brother here, he loves the writings that were received by Robert James Lees, who I have met and can tell you he is a redeemed and beautiful soul who was a spectacular channel while on earth. And although he did not get quite the amount of encouragement to pray for Divine Love as James Padgett did, he was given a picture of the spirit world that was, and that is, a wonderful depiction. 

Now, although Robert Lees didn’t quite give you a picture of the Celestial heavens, I ask you has anyone? For it is impossible to convey, but in concordance with James Padgett and George Owen and Anthony Borgia and many others, he gave a very vivid impression of spirit life from the hells to the spheres of Divine Love such as the third sphere, which comparative to the earth is a paradise. The fourth sphere, where all things, all truth becomes apparent, and the clinging to ones earth life is let go of. The fifth sphere, a true gateway to those seeking transformation in God’s love. 

The sixth sphere, although not covered in these (Lees) writings, but in James Padgett, where purified souls live in natural harmony in much happiness, in much bliss and are free to pursue their hearts desire, however, as you know, there is not transcendence and transformation of the soul, even in the perfection of the sixth sphere. For that  is in the seventh sphere and beyond, in the Celestial realms. 

And even I cannot describe the splendor, the perfection, the beauty, the infinite harmony of the Celestial kingdom where I dwell, and beyond all that, the unending love of God which permeates us. It is a joy beyond expression. So, if you are truly concerned about your earth lives, which will one day transition to spirit, no matter how long or how short your stay is, I encourage you to look into some of these writings and get a sense of how even full of light, full of love, full of beauty and creativity, even the third sphere is and how community reigns and yet free will is never denied. These earthly concerns can be let go, truly in spirit and I encourage you to let some of them go on the earth plane, for they shall not serve you in your walk into the future. 
   
My brother here, he has hope of consciousness, hope of awakening, hope of transformation in Divine Love. These are the messages we like to give through him and they are true. There are many voices and whatever voices you find yourself responding to that serves your soul, we ask you continue to listen. But if those voices bring you fear or worry, then listen to the voices of hope, for this is what we wish to give you. Hope and encouragement and clarity, that your destination is beyond your fears, beyond your imagination of bliss even. It is love and only love that upholds the universe. 

So, turn on that love light. Be not concerned or in doubt or afraid. The love of God will change you, will keep you safe, will bring you every good and perfect gift. That is our promise. That is the promise of God’s love and my wish for you in this season of joy where Jesus, his mission, his being Christed, anointed in the love of God, is a message to transform the world. Take this to heart. Rejoice! 
    
I shall step back and be in this beautiful circle with you all in the blessings of God’s love. As we pray for more, ever-more Divine Love, I thank you. May God bless you. 
   
I am Judas, once of Kerioth, now your Celestial brother and eternal friend. Go in the grace of God.
