You would do well to listen to the [guidance of our friend](/contemporary-messages/messages-sorted-year/messages-2023/our-role-on-earth-af-25-jan-2023/) who has come to speak to you. For it is important for each of you to establish communication with us so that you may be guided more readily. Each of you has to a degree, the capacity of mediumship. But that mediumship may express itself in different ways and indeed, all mediumship is communication with spirit and every individual upon the planet has this capacity if it is developed. So this is what is important at this time, to open the lines of communication between us and you so that you may be well informed and know your guidance.  Indeed, what facilitates such communication is a consistent and dedicated prayer life, receiving the great gift of Divine Love and a calmed mind enough that you may hear us, you may feel us and know us as a presence with you. 

We can readily impress upon your mind many things but we cannot force you to listen or to receive in a conscious way these impressions. Though indeed we are always with you encouraging you and impressing upon you through your soul those things that are of a Godly nature. Indeed for most of you, by the time it comes to  conscious realization, it has been filtered greatly and interpreted much by your mind. It is important to clear the channel between your soul and your mind in such a way that you may have the communication which we desire to have with each of you. In truth there is little that obstructs this but even these little elements of resistance and biases and mindful interpretations are enough to thwart our communication or at least distort it greatly. 

My friends, you must practice in your contemplations, meditations and prayers and ask that there be a clear channel of communication within you, not only with us but with God. This way you will realize what you are longing for. The peace will come. The joy of the heart filled and swelling with love and joy and light. These things shall come to you, this I promise. This has been offered and it shall be given. It is your choice. It is reliant upon your will and your efforts. I encourage you to make that effort to know what it is that you truly desire and how you will act upon those desires. 
May God bless you, my friends. I am Bartholomew and I am here to encourage you as well on the Path Divine, the beautiful Love of God infilling and growing within you, making you a true child of God, a true instrument and clear in your instrumentality. The flow of Godâ€™s Will through you, His blessings, much may come to those who are humble yet strong, powerful yet wise, loving always. God bless you. God bless you my friend
