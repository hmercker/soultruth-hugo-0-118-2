May the Essence of God continue to transform you, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. I come. I am Jesus. I come to bid you farewell, to acknowledge your efforts, to encourage you along the way so that, indeed, we may all fulfil what is asked of us by God, to implement His plan upon the Earthly plane. For is this not our goal together, to bring the truth of His Love, the light of His Love, the joy of His Love to the world so that it, too, may be transformed in love? You have dedicated yourselves for a period of time, seeking transformation, growth and light and so you have received what you seek for. You have accomplished what you desire. Though, as you are aware, this seeking and desiring and transformation is without end. We continue to journey together, do we not, my beloveds? We continue to seek, do we not? We continue to awaken, do we not? 

Allow the gift of His Love to lead the way, to open the door so that you may truly be that instrument of light, that beautiful channel of love in the world. God is preparing many for this task. He has gathered you for a particular purpose and outcome and that has been realised. Yet indeed it is only one step of many and you will continue to change and shift and awaken and transform. For this is the Law of Love in action. This is the soul seeking its mark with God. You will have us all, the angels of the Celestial Heavens, with you upon this journey.

The awakening continues. The transformation realised to a degree, but in need of much more. I urge you, my beloved brothers and sisters, to continue with your prayers together, to continue to forge the bonds of love, to continue to perk up your ears to listen to the Will of God, and to seek His great benediction upon your soul. For as you continue to draw to you that which is required, that which will transform, that which will heal, that which will bring greater light, so you come closer to your goal. God, in His great Love for you, shall provide the ways and means for the fulfilment of your purpose and destiny upon the world. 

You have seen many things in your time together. Much has been shared. Much has been perceived, felt and known. This is the way of God’s Touch upon you and this shall continue. You shall continue to open and awaken to many things and know your journey toward God that will have much to give, many experiences to live, many perceptions to open, many understandings and knowledge to be gained. As you grow in love, all that is good and of God will come to you. You will embrace this with joy, acknowledgment and gratitude. It is a journey that we have all taken, those of us who have walked the Divine Path, seeking our redemption, our transformation. We understand, we have great compassion for your struggles. We hope to uplift you and reinforce all that is good within you, so that when you make your choices, they will be made with the wisdom and the power of love and truth.

Many of you see the long road ahead. Many of you understand that these things are not readily accomplished upon the Earthly plane. You are willing. You step forward in faith. You trust in the Will of God. Indeed, this is what brings you so close to us and us so close to you, that willingness, that faith, that trust, that love for God. It marks your passage along the road of redemption. Indeed, such attributes and qualities within you will grow and strengthen and deepen as you find your way beyond that which is not of love to that which is of love. 

Understanding the power of love, the transformational effects of love, the expression of love, the awakening of love within you and the inflowing of love to bring this awakening,  is the foundation of your journey. As you continue to acknowledge this, and to strive towards alignment and truth and all that is of light, so the gifts that you possess, the beautiful abilities and powers within you, shall emerge and be expressed with such beauty and grace that your souls will touch many other souls. You will teach the truth with humility and a light that shall glow within you and all around you. God will open many doors and many opportunities will come to you to serve in light and love.

Humanity is in great need of each of you. Humanity is seeking and yet often lost. Yet within every soul is a yearning for the truth, for God, for peace, for love. You will point the way. For you will be the example, the fulfilment of this great trek toward light. Be sure within you, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, that you are on the road. Be confident of God’s guidance and protection and Love for you. Put aside all those conditions and thoughts, patterns within you that are contrary to this. For you are at that point of great choice, of acceptance of this journey in such a way that it will fulfil the Will of God, that you will travel the road laid before you, lit with love, God’s Hand beckoning you forward. You must choose, beloveds, and you must look at the life that you live and find the ways and means of higher expression, of greater harmony, greater love. 

For in order to light the way, you must choose and desire it. In so doing, all the resources of God will be laid at your feet and you will be uplifted every moment, every breath. This is the power of love. This is the way of love and the way of God and His Love. Seek this beyond all else. Walk the journey, the road that God has designated for you and find the fulfilment that He brings to you and awaits you as you step forward. All is given freely, abundantly. It is for you to open yourselves more fully, with greater faith and trust. For as you walk in this way, so the light grows brighter. There is an ease and grace to your journey as you find this fulfilment of the soul awakening to the truth of love. 

I am with you, my beloveds. I love you dearly. I embrace you all in the great work of bringing the truth of God’s Love to the world. You will find your way. You will find your special gifts that will fulfil the plan of God to redeem His children. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you. I shall love you forever and we shall be together forever. God bless you. God bless you all upon the eternal journey.
