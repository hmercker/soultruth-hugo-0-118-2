# Are You Willing to Receive God's Great Gift

Bartholomew received by Al Fike

My name is Bartholomew. When I walked the Earth, I was a black man. I experienced the healing Touch of God’s Love while I was associated with Jesus and his followers centuries ago. I now am an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom and I take great interest in my brothers and sisters upon the Earthly plane who have such great struggles in life. Most do not know the solutions to these struggles. Most do not know their true selves and natures. Most are lost in the darkness and semi-darkness of the material world, a place that is continuing to be somewhat chaotic where change comes quickly, both welcome and unwelcome.

My beloved friends, are you willing to make a change within yourselves? Are you looking to bring yourselves in closer alignment with your Creator? Are you seeking that which your soul is longing for? In this case, you have come here by the Law of Attraction drawing you together creating a formidable force which can be unified, powerful and beautiful. Are you willing to step forward and seek the great gift that God offers you, the blessing of His Love ,which you must long for from your soul and pray for so that consciously you are accepting the invitation, opening yourselves to this great gift?

My beloved friends, this is but a moment in time but every moment carries great hope and great possibility. So you have gathered together to experience something that may have ignited your curiosity, that may have ignited a longing within you for something more in your life. I say to you, my friends, those who seek a side of the general flow of society who want something different, who seek to be more fulfilled than that which the material world has to offer, you may do so at this time. For we are present with each of you and have been present with some of you for a long time. I urge you to take advantage of the opportunities given, that we may now sit together in prayer and receiving this great gift. The blessings of God are pouring upon us now. May you find that quiet place within yourself so that you might awaken, come to know the gentle Touch of God which can heal all, which can change all things and bring these things into greater harmony. As His Love pours upon you, His peace is with you, the grace of God’s touch all encompassing. Beloved souls, shall we put aside the material concerns, the distractions, even the noises that are around you, and go to that place of Light, of God’s Love. Beloved souls, here we are together. Here we are in love.

God bless you, my friends. I am Bartholomew and I come to pray with you. Father, open our souls to the great inflowing of your love. Awaken us with your Touch. Shift our consciousness towards that of the soul, that we may come to know the wonderment, the beauty and the grace that lies within us, come to know the power of your Touch to heal and transform us all. May God bless us and keep us in Light. Beloveds, be at peace and know that God is here. God is with us and shall we be with God in our hearts and souls, longing for that touch, that blessing. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you.
