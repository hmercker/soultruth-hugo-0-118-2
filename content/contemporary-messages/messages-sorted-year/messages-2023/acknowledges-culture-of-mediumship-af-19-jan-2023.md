# Professor Salyards Acknowledges Culture of Mediumship  

January 19<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Received by Al Fike  



Bless you, my friends. I am Professor Salyards. May the Father’s Love continue to flow into your souls, awakening you, informing your journey towards at-onement with God. That journey is unique to each individual, though you gather together because of the similarities and the unity of desire for the great gift of God’s Love. Indeed, in your gathering that you plan, is this not the major and fundamental purpose for this gathering? Indeed, as you pray together will not this desire, this intense prayer, be offered up to God so that each of you may receive a great blessing of His Love?

A culture has formed among what you call Divine Love followers, or at least those who follow the teachings that were laid out in the Padgett volumes and the subsequent gatherings and collections of individuals who have risen from this initial effort. In many cases, mediumship is part of that culture. It is a fundamental element of many prayer circles in the world at this time. It cannot be hidden or put aside, for it is very much a part of your cultures. As such, there is a need to acknowledge this, is there not?

Now, if all of you upon the Earth plane gather together and decide to banish mediumship within your circles, then that is a decision that must be respected among those of you on Earth and those of us in the spirit world. Those of us in the Celestial Kingdom will honour your wishes, whatever that may be, for we do not circumvent free will. We merely work with what is available to us, the opportunities that are presented, the desires that are expressed and what evolves as you, as a collective group who are dedicated to the Divine path and to receiving the great gift of God’s Love, decide and create together. 

Mediumship is a beautiful form of communication, given the right conditions and those with the ability to communicate consistently with the Celestial Angels and be a conduit for our words. This is a simple requirement, yet, the word *“consistent”* is a very important word in this regard. For many can channel angels at certain times and circumstances, but can they do so consistently? Are they able to put aside their own biases and earthly conditions and also acknowledge the light within their soul that has come with the great gift of God’s Love? If they can truly do this then, indeed, a new channel for our words and encouragement has been born into the world and this gives us joy. 

Indeed, on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who can only pray and feel satisfied in a Circle of Light when a message has been given. If this becomes a major component within your Circles of Light, and of those who are participants in that circle only come to listen to the words of the angels and yet do not act upon them, this is certainly not what is intended. Rather, it is absolutely vital that those who are in attendance to Circles of Light must come to the realisation that they are there primarily to open their souls to receive the great gift of God’s Love. 

It can certainly be the case that a time of prayer in a Circle of Light could be filled with many messages from beginning to end, given the right medium to do so. But we do not do this, at least not very often. Rather, we desire to give an inspiring message, something to set the tone as, indeed, the prayer sets the tone for that circle. Then, it is a desirable situation where a time of quiet and prayer and contemplation is added to these moments together. Of course, some find it difficult to sit in prayer for a number of minutes, and some are very comfortable with this. There are even some who do not wish to be distracted by a message from a Celestial Angel. Indeed, as I have stated, each individual walks upon this path in their own unique way. 

Yet, as you have come to know, many find a message from an angel uplifting and inspiring. Indeed, their words speak to their souls and their soul stirs in response to that. Is this not a beautiful gift given, a valuable part of the session of prayer? I would say that the vast majority of individuals who are interested in joining you in prayer for this magnificent gathering that you are planning would appreciate, at least in some of these sessions, a message from us. I would accommodate this desire and allow these things to flow in accordance to what may be intended, what will unfold and evolve with these important gatherings. As I have said, it is a component of your culture that continues to grow and is very much alive within it. 

As you come together to express your journey in Divine Love, your awakening to Divine Love, your understanding of Divine Love then, indeed, it can be that this aspect of communication can be readily given, provided it is not the centerpiece, the focal point, of the gathering, rather, a beautiful addition to a prayer given that is sincere and universally expressed by your Circle of Light that will gather. So, it is a somewhat delicate issue. So some of you find it difficult to find the balance, to create the conditions, the ultimate and utmost conditions of light for this circle. 

Know that we are with you, my friends. We shall be with each individual who comes. The light of God shall, indeed, shine forth and for many, revelations will come to them. Indeed, we will not interfere with such a purpose and plan. Our goal is to augment, to reinforce, to uplift and to bring a harmony into the circle. Thus we will be there working diligently in order to bring that harmony and light, the truth of God’s Love shining forth. Each of you will help to bring that to fruition. 
 
I would not worry, my friends. I would not get stuck on certain issues that are already resolved. Indeed, harmony will come always to those of you who pray diligently to be within the flow of God’s Will and in harmony with His Laws of Love. These things shall come to each of you as you continue to progress. Your questions will be answered. Insights will come as your soul continues to be awakened and, in that awakening, insights and truth will come to your consciousness.  
 
My beloved friends, there are no true issues of contention, rather, the need for clear communication and understanding and love. Who among you does not agree with this? For each of you, as you have continued upon this journey together, have expressed this desire and you have demonstrated this desire. 

May God bless you, beloved souls, deeply, dearly, profoundly, so that when that time comes that you gather together, all that you feel will be tremendous love for all of your brothers and sisters. There will be no concern or worry about this individual or that individual’s desires, rather that you may come to understand the collective desire that arises from such a gathering, and that is to be with God. And so you shall be, my friends. You will be with God and God will respond in joyous, profound, revelatory, wonderful love to all who gather, all who come together, brothers and sisters understanding a profound truth of the universe, that they may live this and acknowledge this with one another.

My beautiful friends, I congratulate you on the efforts that you have made and, indeed, you continue to understand God’s Will, at least to some degree, and to live it in your lives. God bless you, my brothers and sisters. I am your Professor Salyards. My love is with you all. We shall, indeed, bring light to the world together and love profound will flow to each and every soul who desires this gift. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
