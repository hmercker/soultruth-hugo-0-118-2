# Speak Truth with no Regrets

April 17<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



I wish to speak a bit about regret in the midst of this joyous occasion. In my time on earth as I began to receive more of God’s love and be ever more often in prayer, it became very important for me to speak truth, and when I didn’t, I would often get ill. Sometimes this would result from an occasion of a spirit coming in or working through someone speaking untruth or simply being out of harmony and I began to regret not standing up for truth. So, as my beloved knows all too well, I would, with as much love in my soul as I could possibly muster, speak truth, and point out that there is nothing not seen by the Heavenly Father. I will give you an example here: People often question as to whether if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there, does it still make a sound? 

I’d like you to consider this in relationship to your thoughts, to your actions, and to the things you may say. Though you might shield them from the world, God knows them all and here in spirit everything is laid bare. Now I do not wish this message to be negative, so let me put it another way. You do not want to come into spirit regretting not telling those you love how much you love them; regretting not helping those in need; regretting not loving yourself enough and taking care of yourself so that you may be a help and blessing to others. I tell you so many come in spirit with deep regret and these I have pointed out to you are relatively minor. I need not go through a litany of sins, of deep in-harmonies, that come with those who have led others astray, who have committed violent acts, abused others, and gained much in earthly things at the expense of others. These burdens you surely do not wish to carry in spirit. 

The sweetness of your souls that I can see encourages me to encourage you to speak of love, to speak truth, to walk in harmony and to stand up for God’s love and truth with compassion. For when you do, you draw the company of Angels and there is no power on earth that can withstand the great power of Divine Love. There is no falsehood that can stand or prevail against truth. So, walk without regret. Take that leap of faith and we will leap with you! Play that song! 

I know that to speak truth to those who might be most opposed to hearing it is a great gift because those are the souls that have the greatest need to hear it. Their suffering can be great, and you will not regret stepping forward, bringing the light and love of God that you have in your souls to the world so in need. 

With all my love and the glorious joy in my heart I shall step back and join you in this beautiful prayer. May God bless you all with a great inflowing of His love.  I am Care.
