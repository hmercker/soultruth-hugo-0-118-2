One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, Jeanne (Joan). Jeanne of Arc. Yes, you hear me well. I come with blessings from the Father. You ask and you shall receive. You ask from your souls for this Love and your desires grow strong within you. God knows what they are. God prepares the way for them to be answered and fulfilled when in harmony with His plan for the salvation of humanity.

Timing on your planet is important. Trust that you will receive those things that you most desire that are in harmony with God’s Will. Trust that what you seek is in harmony with God’s Will. Most of all, trust your Heavenly Father and those who serve Him to bring to you those things that you desire that are in harmony with God’s Will.

It is a perfectly ordered universe. As God wills, so it shall be done. In this way, all is in harmony and all is of great love. This you shall know. Very soon, you shall know and understand more, as Love flows to and through the Earth and many changes result in a more perfect environment in which to develop your souls. This is God’s gift to you and to all of His children, for His Love is great. It is mighty, as you will see, as the transformation continues to uplift His children and to bring them to a place of harmony, happiness and joy.

Be not afraid. Look to your Father. Open to your Father. We are walking hand in hand with you. Our love surrounds you and uplifts you. Be open to us. Be clear with us. You may even enjoy this walk past the disharmonies that exist for only a short time longer and into the bright spheres of life upon a transformed planet.

Stay close to God and we will be close to you. Give your love freely, completely and constantly. I am your sister, Jeanne. I thank you for allowing me to come and speak to you. My love is with you. The love of many is with you. We support you with our love. We desire to help you and bring you forward into God’s glorious harmony. I love you. God bless you.
