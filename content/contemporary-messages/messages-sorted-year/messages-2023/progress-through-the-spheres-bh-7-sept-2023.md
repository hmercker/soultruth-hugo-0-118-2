Hello Brian. It's your friend in spirit, Joseph Babinsky. I hope you are doing well. It has been a while since we talked and I would like to make this a more frequent occurrence as I feel that I have some words that I can offer as a benefit for people who listen to these messages.

I have made it to the Celestial Heavens. I now reside in the first Celestial sphere and it has been the result of continuous praying since I got here (spirit world) and praying in circles and groups, praying along with the circles that you guys have there on the Earth plane and also in groups of Divine Love followers here in the spirit world as well as with Celestial Angels in attendance. And so, all of this speeds up the process. It's all about desire. If you really desire something, like getting to the Celestial Heavens, then nothing can stop you. Things will be placed before you to make what you want happen faster and happen for sure. And that is the situation that I was in. I really enjoyed my stay in the various spheres that I passed through, and while my time in some of them was short and a little longer in some others, I don't regret moving through them fast, because I know that I can visit them at any point, at any time that I want, because here we can visit all of the spheres that are lower than the one that we reside in at any time that we want, for as long as we want and my Divine Love business can take me to any of these spheres, but I can go to these spheres for personal business as well, that is enjoyment or visiting friends and family members. Nowhere really is off limits to us once we get to the Celestial Heavens, except for the spheres above me. But I am very content with where I am now. It is so beautiful. And the love and the peace and the camaraderie and the beauty of this place, it is all too much to describe to you. And I know I have had the same thing said to me when I was in your position on the Earth, receiving messages from people in higher spheres who couldn't explain, and it truly is difficult to explain. It is like a 3D person trying to explain to a 2D person what 3D is. But just know that it eclipses the most beautiful places on the Earth and the love eclipses all the love on the Earth, so it is something to look forward to by every person who hears this message. I promise you that if you aim for the Celestial Heavens, you will not be sorry. It is the best goal you could have. It will take you up through all the spheres and the end result is that you will be in the best place that you can be, but with the opportunity to progress always towards God and always towards higher places in the Heavens.Â 

I am so glad that you are busy again Brian with taking these messages. It is important to us on your spirit team that you get back to receiving messages because we have so many that we want to deliver. I look forward to our collaboration and I thank you for thinking of me often. It is nice to be remembered and loved and I feel lucky to be remembered and loved by many people.

This retreat that you guys have coming up in Laurelville will be a wonderful get-together for all the Divine Love followers in the mortal form who arrive there and be aware that there will be many Divine Love spirits in attendance as well, as well as many Celestial Angels. There will be many more spirits and angels in attendance than people in the mortal form and this is because it is much easier for us to go places and be at events than it is for humans on the Earth. Some people who may want to go to Laurelville and cannot due to circumstances, well this is sad and we wish that it could be different, of course. But we have no such problem in the spirit world or as Celestial Angels, and that is why we will have many more spirits and angels in attendance joining with you in prayer, supporting your Divine Love prayers and prayers for healing, and so it should be a time of great inflowing of God's Divine Love because of the number of souls who will be praying, and it should also be a time of healing for those individuals on the Earth plane, because you will have many angels and spirit healers present who are focusing God's love and its healing aspects upon the souls of all present. And what goes into the soul shines out through the spirit and into the body physical. So look for more Divine Love when you leave this retreat and look for healing in your spirit, soul and your physical body as you leave this retreat as well. And any and all who join on the physical plane in prayer during these times will receive the same benefit.

We look forward to this time and we wish everyone safety as they travel to this retreat and we pray that love and joy is shared amongst you all as you gather. May the world benefit in many ways from this retreat, substantial ways and in other subtle ways. We look forward to seeing you at this retreat, Brian and everyone else who goes and I will speak with you again soon before this retreat happens as we have a lot to say.

Thank you for connecting with me, Brian. Keep up the good work, and God bless you.
