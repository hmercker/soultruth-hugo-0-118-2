Beloved souls, I am Seretta Kem. The tendrils of love are continuing to wrap around all who are involved in this beautiful circle that is coalescing in love and light. Your thoughts are intermingling with the thoughts of others. Your intentions are clear and united. The power of love is dispelling any reticence and sense of distance between you. Instead comes the excitement and the awareness that you are one body in God's blessings and ministrations upon all of you. This sense will grow as you continue to pray together and be together. Not only you within this small group but within the greater group of dedicated souls seeking to grow, to expand in God's Love, seeking to be transformed, seeking to be guided and blessed. And so it shall be, my friends. 

The stage has been set. The efforts and prayers have been made. The angels are at the ready. As you, beloved souls, eagerly seek to serve and to be God's instruments in the beauty and unfoldment of God's plan. How blessed you are. How excited we all are, knowing what is to come, what will unfold. We are eager to see how you respond to what has been orchestrated and awaits the expression of God's Will and plan for you all. 

May your day be filled with joy, my beloved friends. All will come together in harmony as you will meet your friends. And they will meet you, embracing in love and joy. Acknowledging that each belongs to the other, a family of love that is growing, and shall continue to expand exponentially in times to come. 

You will be utilised as God's servants in many ways. Much travel and connection will be made as God's plan unfolds and you feel yourselves being drawn into this plan. Be an integral part of this plan to work together to help awaken humanity. The beginning of something wonderful is now upon us, the unfolding of something profound and crucial for the world. 

You are a part of this, my beloved brothers and sisters, as are we, swept along on the great river of love and God's Will as we listen and we allow ourselves to be within this great flow and journey towards light, towards at-onement with God. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Seretta Kem and we await the unfoldment, the glory and the light that is coming and is upon you. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
