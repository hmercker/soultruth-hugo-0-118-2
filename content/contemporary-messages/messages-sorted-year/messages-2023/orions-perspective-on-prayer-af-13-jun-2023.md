# Our Stellar Friend’s Perspective on Prayer

It is good to pray, beloved souls. I am Orion. Your prayers are not only heard by God, but they are heard by the angels, by the highest spirits, even into the universe, depending upon the intensity and fervency of that prayer, and also draws the light. It draws many beings to assist you, for this is the law answered.

The power of prayer is so very misunderstood on your planet. Many people recite prayers, but those prayers are of the mind and are often of rote so that they do not reach very high into the heavens or to God or to others. They merely reflect a desire for another individual to be prayerful, to answer the call for prayer, which is often given to them by institutions and those of authority who control these institutions in your world. Thus, the thoughts that are thought to be prayers circulate in various circles of consciousness amongst those who are part of a certain church or religion, those who are attuned to certain ideals and certain dogmas, and those spirits who are also a part of those. But often, these prayers are very faint when it comes to reaching God or reaching high spirits, Celestial Spirits, and even us in the stellar regions of the cosmos.

When you pray and ask for the great gift of Divine Love, the highest blessing of all, and you do so with the fervency of your own heart, then that prayer reaches far out in many directions. When you pray for your loved ones, pray for those in need of healing, and do so with a sincerity and depth of heart that is real and powerful, then the blessings flow. I urge you, my beloved friends, to pray with the deepest of sincerity, the greatest of urgency, of desire, of longing, so that those prayers trigger the great laws that God has made that respond and uplift and heal and elicit the Holy Spirit to come down to you, to each of you, and bring that great gift of His Love.

Prayer in my world is every thought that every individual has, for each individual whether they are newly born or ancient, has a deep connection with the Creator of all. Thus, their thoughts and their desires reach God readily. You, upon this earthly plane, must penetrate many layers of the human condition, darkness, in order to reach God. Therefore, it requires deep sincere and powerful prayer to penetrate these conditions, to be in alignment with God, to be heard. So it is when you pray with your soul, that fervency that comes with feeling and thought, desire. Then, with these elements in play, your prayers are heard. They do not have to be eloquent in words. In fact, often, simple prayer, using simple words, is the truer reflection of your soul than when you use your mind and bring together eloquent and long-versed prayers to God.

Of course, any length of prayer, if sincere, will reach its mark. But indeed, many of you wish to be very economical with your prayers. For after you pray, do you not commune together with God? This is the great blessing that comes and is desired. So, short prayers will certainly bring you to that place, provided they follow the laws that are in place. Prayers of the heart, prayers of the soul, prayers of the spirit, prayers of the mind, when in conjunction with one another, in alignment in such a way that all of these elements come together in harmony, then a true prayer is spoken and a powerful one at that.

My beloved and beautiful souls who come together in prayers, these Circles of Light, when one is praying.
