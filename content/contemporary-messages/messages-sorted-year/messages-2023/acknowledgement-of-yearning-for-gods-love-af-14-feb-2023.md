# Acknowledges Everyone’s Deep Yearning for God’s Love

February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Received by Al Fike  



I come to pray with you. I come to acknowledge each one of you. For, each one within your heart and soul, there is a deep desire for God and to receive the gift that He has to give to your soul, the Essence of His Soul. I come, I am your brother and your friend, I am Jesus. I come to encourage you, each one of you upon your journey towards at-onement with God. For without this desire within your heart and soul expressed in prayer, expressed with every breath, how might you find your at-onement with God?  It is the true longing and aching of the soul desiring to be with God, to reunite with God, for every soul has been birthed by God and comes from Him and is given life, the opportunity to make the journey as a separate and unique individual that will find its onement with the great Creator. A gift beyond gifts, this life that is given to each soul, identity and purpose and fulfilment in every way, provided that dear soul seeks the truth and lives the truth that they may be in harmony with God’s laws of creation, that they may be in harmony with love. Each soul, is given the opportunity, given the choice and the invitation to be with God, not as they were before they were incarnated but as they are as unique souls upon the journey of fulfilment of who and what they are as God’s Creation. 

May you each find the answers that you seek. May you each know the truth that is your own self realised in the great flow of life, walking through time and expression and all the wonderments that life has to bring to you. As God seeks you out, may you hear His longing for your closeness, for your presence, in a conscious way with Him. For God seeks communion with His children. God seeks acknowledgement, both of you to Him and Him to you, so that there is an awareness blossoming within you that brings with it joy and great love and at times bliss. For, these things come to His children who knock on the door of awareness and truth and love that is available to every soul. Be with Him, beloveds. We are all His children. Whether it be those who are exalted and live within the Celestial Kingdom or those who are upon the Earth plane, mortals who struggle and who are seeking the truth, God loves each one of us equally, profoundly, with a depth and breadth that is beyond comprehension. Even we in the Celestial Kingdom, even I, who am at the pinnacle of light, still cannot comprehend the depth of God’s Love, for it is infinite. So we make that journey forever seeking, receiving, acknowledging and communing with our Heavenly Father. We urge you along my brethren, you who seek tentatively, you who wonder, you who pray and long. We reach out to you and grasp your hand and walk with you as you seek, as you put your face to God and seek the radiance of His Love to shine upon you. 

We are with you always, never to leave, never to leave. My beloveds, we are pleased that you continue to seek fellowship in Circles of Light, to seek out one another, to contribute to these Circles and those who have made journeys to embrace your brothers and sisters. Have you not been blessed in accordance to your efforts? Have you not felt the Touch of God and His joy and acknowledgement of your efforts? Have you not been deeply blessed? So I encourage you all to seek out one another, to pray together, for when you come together in this way you create powerful light in the world. You bring the blessings of God through you, through the Portals and Lattice of Light and all the elements and aspects of God’s blessings upon you and through you into the world, lighting the world, dispersing the darkness, bringing comfort, bringing healing and peace to many. Continue in your work, beloveds, continue to seek the great gift of God’s Love and know that in this you shall be blessed mightily, profoundly and powerfully.

May God bless you, beloveds. Know that I am with you, that I seek to be with you beloveds, my brethren whom I love dearly, who are in my heart and my prayers daily. I am with you. I am truly your brother and I reach you in love, in prayer, in my desire to uplift you and to embrace you. May God embrace us all at these moments. May we be uplifted, may our souls open to a great inflowing of His Love. So we will know the grace of God, His Touch bringing us joy and the knowledge of the Truth of His Love and existence in our lives. Blessed are the children of God. Blessed are we who acknowledge our beloved Father in heaven. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. Have no doubt, I am with you. God bless you. God bless you.
