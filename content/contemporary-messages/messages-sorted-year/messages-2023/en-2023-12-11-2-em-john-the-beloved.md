John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now, John. I come in truth and love and bring blessings. I am the beloved for my Father has created my soul to expand extensively to receive His great gift of Divine Love, that I might be at one with Him to the extent that this love possesses my soul.

I come to pray with you beautiful children who are true in your souls to our Father’s love, to our Father’s existence. You know the truth and you exercise this truth each time you pray, each time you lift up your longings, your soul’s longings to God. This is what you would call a miracle, the response that comes from God each and every time, you ask with your souls for this great love that transforms and builds blessings within you. And you come closer and closer to the Source of this love.

We are many here with you today showering you with our love, blessing you with our guidance which I am happy to say, you are learning to follow. Open yourselves more fully, more completely that you may receive, moment to moment, continual guidance that will affect not only your lives but the lives of those around you that you may be influencing through your souls’ love, those souls that you touch. This is a great work. This is greater even, in volume, than the Master was able to do. For there are many of you with much love in your souls and following your guidance, you will meet many. You will touch many and they, too, will touch many, and so on. This is God’s plan in action. Blessed souls, you are part of that plan to be human conduits for the love of God to touch His children upon the Earth.

Know how blessed you are. Trust those inclinations that you have, that we bring to you, that your Father asks of you, that you feel compelled to do. For it is your souls responding to God’s mission for you. This is truly, truly a great blessing for each of your souls. We will be with you, every step of the way. Our love surrounds you and protects you. The Father rejoices in the work that you do. God bless you. God bless you true, true missionaries of God’s love. I am your brother, John the Beloved and my love is with you. The love of all of us who are here, is with you. God bless you.
