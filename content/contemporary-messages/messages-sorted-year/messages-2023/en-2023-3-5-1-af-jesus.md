Jesus received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I come. I am Jesus. I come because I love you and wish to pray with you for the great gift of the Father’s Love. As you know, many years ago I ministered to my brothers and sisters on Earth. Now I come in a different way but still, the message is the same. Still, I come to be with you, my beloved brothers and sisters on Earth. And I shall continue in this ministry until the last soul is entered into the Celestial Kingdom. Until those gates are closed, I come to be with you, to encourage you, to be that light along the road, showing you the way.

So my ministry expands and reaches many parts of the globe and it will grow, beloveds. For the Truth of God’s Love is well established on Earth and there are many at this time who are seeking and considering truth. So the angels are with them, so to inspire and direct them that they may find this simple truth, that they may know it as you know it, that they may practice this prayer as you practice. In this way, more lights are formed upon your Earth, more carry the truth, and they are changing the conditions of the world from darkness to light as are you, beloveds. As are you agents of change in the world and your prayers are important, your prayers for the redemption of your own soul and the redemption of mankind and the healing of your world. All these things are important, and as you exercise your faith, so the power of your prayers increase and you forge a deep connection with your Creator. This is important, to be in the grace of God, to acknowledge consciously God’s Love for you and for all of humanity. Because this is the way and means that God will heal your world. It is with love, His Love, pouring out upon the world. Each of you who acknowledges this and opens yourself to receive it, will find that with each day you step closer into light, greater light, and you walk the truth more fully. In this, those around you will benefit by your light, your actions, your thoughts.

Be true to your soul. I know there are many aspects of yourself that you wish would be transformed by the Father’s Love, that human part of you that continues to live in the world in that greyness of being, that you wish to be purified and healed. So it will come as you continue to seek the gift of God’s Love. So you will find great changes within you. Your motivations and your thoughts, your actions, your efforts, will all change and move into greater alignment with the light that is shining within your soul and the Will of God that is shining forth upon you that comes ever so slowly. Drop by drop you are blessed with each prayer. But indeed, as you continue and are consistent with your prayers so you will find in time with the accumulation of this gift of love, that you will change and you will be transformed. It is the law in action, beloveds. It is the Light of God’s Touch upon you that is the transformation that you so desire, His Love pouring into your souls awakening you and healing you. The power of love, the power of love is the key to all transformation and change and directs you upon the road towards harmony and joy and grace.

Walk with me, beloveds. Walk with all your angel friends. Walk with God’s Touch upon you and you will know the great transformation of your soul and in time, enter into the Celestial Kingdom and be with God in such glory and wonderment and joy that you could not comprehend at this time. How glorious this is. How the rewards will be great, beloveds, as you forge on in your efforts to be at one with God. God bless you, beloveds. I walk with you. I walk with you, never to leave, always to pray and acknowledge the truth of God within your hearts and minds and souls. The transformation continues and shall last for all eternity, beloveds, all eternity. You shall know the progression of your soul awakening, transforming, growing, expanding in light for all eternity.

God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. I am with you, and I love each one of you. I have prayed for each one of you and I shall continue to minister to each of you as you seek the Truth of God’s Love. So, I am close, so the angels are close, and so God blesses us all in the Truth of His Love. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you. May His peace be with you in these moments of prayer.
