Jesus received by Al Fike

…of God’s Love be with you, my beloved brothers and sisters. I come, I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Heavens and your brother and friend. For truly, each of you are my brethren and I care for each of you, I love each of you. For, when one is endowed with the Father’s Love, one cannot but feel and express love for all. As you have come together in your desire for truth, your desire for God, your desire for love, so you have extended the Lattice of Light out into the world ever further. These strands of light grow and connect, soul to soul, with many others. Those in your families, those in your life are being influenced by this light, by your efforts towards light, and as such, you uplift your communities, your countries, your world.

Indeed, the work just begins, beloveds, the work to transform the world from a place of great need to a place of fulfillment and light and love and joy. For, these things come in prayer, provided you know the truth and the power that is God’s Love for you, this Essence that comes to you with your prayers that are earnest and intense. You bring great light to yourself, you bring great light to the world through these prayers and desires for upliftment and healing and peace.

My beloveds, know that I am with you and I love you, that indeed we form a family of love that shall grow in bonds of love, strengthened in light, beautiful to behold as God continues to bless us all. Though you begin the journey, and in this beginning you feel somewhat unsure of your footsteps and what this journey means, I assure you that your souls know and understand. It is for you to come to know your own soul, and in knowing your soul, to forge your relationship with your Creator, your Heavenly Father who loves you so.

So we are together, brothers and sisters all, upon a journey of discovery and awakening, and that journey shall bring greater truth, higher love, and understanding to each of you. All that which burdens you shall fall away, my beloveds, for this is the truth expressed and acting within you to bring greater harmony and love. As you seek this Love, so the healing begins and the transformation is realized.

My beloveds, know that we are now bonded together in a forged light, a thread of light that shall last for all eternity and shall grow in strength and shall be forever. Beloveds, we carry one another, do we not? We love one another. In the grace and glory of the truth we are truly a part of one another. Know this bond, beloveds. Know that you are never alone and that you have friends both upon the earthly plane, in the world of spirit, and in the Celestial Heavens. There are many who know you and there are many who extend their prayers and their love for each of you. You are not alone, but truly a part of something wondrous, magnificent. You are God’s children awakening to your true potential, your true selves, in the glory and wonderment of this gift that God offers each soul, provided they desire to receive it and to be connected and awakened by it.

Forge your relationship with God, my beloveds, and as you seek the truth and live the truth, all shall come to you in a blaze of glory and light, upliftment and joy. All shall come to you, beloveds, and you will feel the freedom and know the truth as you’ve never known, but shall come to know what God has to give and what you may receive through your desires and longings to be in the flow of His Love and the Light and glory of His Touch, knowing His Will, knowing His Presence with us all. Beloveds, we are His children and shall be evermore His children of love.

God bless you, I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to pray with you. I am with each of you. Feel my love, feel God’s Love. Sense the Light and upliftment and joy that is all about you, beloved souls. God bless you, God bless you all. In the truth of God’s Love so we shall venture forward and know all that God is and has created. It comes in dribs and drops upon you and within you, and shall sparkle into your consciousness many truths and much wisdom and much joy.

God bless you, God bless you all in His Love. I love you and shall love you forever. God bless you.
