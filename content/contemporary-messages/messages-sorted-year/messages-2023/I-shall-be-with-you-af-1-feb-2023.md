So we shall take the journey together in love beyond the confines of this material world, through the journey to spirit and the entrance into the Celestial Kingdom. So you shall uphold one another upon this journey. Pray for one another. Act to uphold your brothers and sisters, for it is in the bonds of love that great strength can be upheld and ascertained by each of you. Use your gifts to benefit them. 

Know that God guides each of you in accordance to your gifts and abilities. You are given many blessings and God shall give you many more. There is great light and wisdom among you. Forge ahead beyond the restrictions of the material world and be God’s instruments of love, truth and light. For this is what your world needs and this is what shall be given through you to uphold your brothers and sisters. It shall be in accordance with God’s plan and Will and it shall flow in great abundance through you. 

My beloveds, I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I shall be with you upon the journey, always with you, never to leave. Know that my hand is upon you, just as our Father’s Hand is upon you. We shall do the work together to lead humanity from darkness to light, beyond the confines of human thought to the liberation of soulful communion with God. God bless you, beloveds. I love you. I shall be with you, each of you, each of you. God bless you.
