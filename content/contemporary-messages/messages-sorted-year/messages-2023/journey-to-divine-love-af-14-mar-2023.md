Greetings to you my friends, I am Yogananda. You wonder why a yogi would be on this program, in this place, in this Circle of Light. But indeed, I have progressed sufficiently enough in the Divine Love, as you call it, to enter into the Celestial Kingdom. I am an Angel of God, transformed sufficiently by His Love, so that I am qualified to speak to you today.

I urge you, my friends, to receive the gift that God has to give to you. It is a blessing of His Soul given to your soul. It is given by the auspices of the Holy Spirit, as it is called, to your soul. It is only received if you are willing and it is only given if you desire it. I urge you to desire this gift. It is the one great gift that shall transform your soul from that of a human soul to the Divine. Do you wish to make this transformation, to go beyond that of the human and to reach for the Divine? For this is the journey that we speak of to you mortals on the Earth plane. It does not require special efforts, rituals, dogmas, ideas to receive this gift. It is a simple giving from God to you. It is personal. It is received through your open soul so that it may reside within it, not only for now but forever. 

Do you wish this gift? Do you desire to receive it? Can you open yourselves willingly and intently so that you may receive the great gift from God that is available to you? This Essence of His Soul is the highest gift that can be given to any soul of His creation. You may come to realize the wonderment and power of such a gift. You may come to see for yourselves this blessing for what it is, which is a reflection of God’s Love for each of you, His generosity and bounteous gift given, with no strings attached, my friends. 

There is nothing you need to do other than to receive, to ask, to be present in the receiving and to know it for the gift that it is. Can you do so, my friends? Can you do so without saying, *“No, I do not deserve this. No, this is not for me. No, I am not worthy?”* These things are fallacy for you are worthy and yes, you can receive and yes, it is available to you and to everyone. Seek it, my friends. Seek it in prayer. Seek it in the secret longing of your soul sent to God. 

In this way, all that you require, all that is available to you, not only with this gift of Love but also many other blessings come with it, that you may be healed and transformed. That you may know the bliss of a powerful relationship with your Creator, that you may come to understand how much you are loved, how potent and beautiful is that love, that all will come in such a flow, such harmony, such beauty and grace that you will dance in joy. You will realise the true meaning of a life and the gift that God has given you which is life. In this further life that is given which is His Love, you are doubly blessed, doubly blessed, my friends. 

May God bless you on the journey of awakening to the truth of your true existence, of the potentials of a soul that has been born in the flesh and shall continue on in the spirit and will discover all the truths of the universe which has come to one soul who has accepted a simple gift, a simple but magnificent, yet magnificent gift that is God’s Love. It is a substance. It is real and it is powerful. Accept it into your hearts, my beloved friends. Accept all that God has to give to you. Have faith that indeed God wishes for all of you to receive abundantly. Have trust in God’s intention for you to live a life that is filled with wonder, beauty and great potential. May you be imbued by the Divine Love that will open the many doors of realisation, of truth, of joy. It comes with this simple gift, a gift that shall remain within you for all eternity, my friends. May you receive it over and over again and come to know it as the one true experience that you may repeat at will and know with all surety and understanding of the significance of this gift given freely. 

May God bless you, my friends. I am Yogananda and I am pleased to be with you today to help you on the journey, to sprinkle a few words of encouragement and inspiration, so that you may step forward with ease and delight and anticipation of what God has to give to each of you, my friends. May you be blessed powerfully and deeply in the truth of love. My love is with you, my friends. My love is with you. Blessings to you and to this world of yours.
