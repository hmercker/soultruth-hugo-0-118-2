# Your Desires and Expectations for a Special Blessing

Friends, I am Michael Collier. Our dear instrument was somewhat mistaken thinking that I am this dear son's guide. Merely that I was close to you while you were having your libations. His guide is certainly Matthew and will continue to be. But it is an honest mistake for he perceived my presence, so therefore put in his mind a connection between this dear son and myself. I wish to say that I've been with all of you at some time or another, as are many angels who do this circuit, so to speak, between each who are yearning and working towards greater light and development of their soul. We work together, a great team of angels, who come together to help uplift those of humanity who are desiring for the light, for the truth, for love. So we put our efforts forth.

There is expectation among you for something unique and special to happen while you are together, not only in this small circle, but in the larger circle to come. I say to you, this is a good perspective and attitude. Because when you have high expectations, when you have a desire within your soul for a high blessing from God, then you open up the possibilities for this to be so. A circuit is created between your desires, God's answering of your desires, thus circulating back and forth, back and forth, between yourself and God. It opens the way. Desire and expectation, these are positive elements, expressions of yourself. It is not that you are demanding from God. Rather, it is a sense that something is about to happen. Within you is excitement and this generates an expectation of a blessing. 

So I encourage you and those who are coming to continue to feed that expectation, that desire for a high blessing from your Heavenly Father. These dynamics are positive. When one enters into this condition and situation without any expectations, a rather mediocre condition of waiting and seeing what may be, then the possibility of excitement, desire and longing expressed, are lost. I encourage you, I encourage all of you, to desire intensely. If this means you have expectations of a blessing, so be it. Do not feel you are misstepping or that this is some error. Rather, in your desires, intense and focused, you open the door for God to bless you and to bless all around you. Is this not what is needed, my friends? 

Now, what may come from these expectations and desires may be different from what your mind puts together to add to these expectations. But I know that you will accept whatever God gives to you. It is not like you have a list and that this list must be fulfilled. Rather, you have a yearning and an expectation that this yearning shall be fulfilled by the blessings of God. Yearning goes out from the soul, connects with God, igniting the laws of response from God. So the blessings are showered down upon you, my beloved friends. 

Be of good cheer. Be excited. Have deep desire and expectations for the time to come and the time that is present. For how else is God to reach you but through these feelings and emotions, reaching out to God? You forge the connection. It is like a bridge where you are on one end and God is on the other. Through each side, a bridge forms from your desires and prayers, through God's responses and His desire to respond to you, to give to you, to love you. Love always comes to those who open themselves to this blessing. His Love, the great Divine Love is what is given, the highest blessing of all. With this, many other blessings flow, the light, love, healing, peace, all come with His touch, as you forge the link between your soul and His great Soul, so it comes. A great channel is opened, clear, and powerful, to each of you, and to all of you.

My desire is that in whatever way that you open this channel, do so with the highest of intentions, with the greatest of desire, so that God will touch you deeply and beautifully. That you will be changed by His Touch, by the experience of your gathering together. It will build and mount each day to a crescendo of blessings, a great influx of your angel friends to be with you, connecting Heaven and Earth in a magnificent way, in a way that shall indeed bring great and powerful blessings to your souls, to your conscious self. You will come to know God in a deeper way, and know yourself in a deeper way. That the many questions that you may have may be answered in this way, through your relationship with your Creator, the One who knows all, the One who is the All, the One who loves you so. 

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Michael Collier and I love you dearly. You are blessed, blessed to know one another, blessed to experience these things together, blessed because God has brought you together. I love you, and will be with you during your journey together. God bless you.
