How the wisdom grows within you, beloveds, I am Confucius. You seek to serve with such earnestness and desire. You want the world to be healed and all whom you love to know the Love of God as you do. Indeed, the yearnings of your soul are such that you wish to manifest the truth in your lives and in the world. God desires for each of you is to be His children, pure and simple, to dedicate your love to God. In so doing, God will find ways for you to dedicate yourselves to others. Each of you have a role to play, a gift to share, indeed many gifts, but they must emerge as you grow in love, for these things are of the soul, not the mind. In your soul many things percolate and shift and change and you must allow yourselves the luxury of listening to your own soul seeking the truth that lies within it. 

Do not fear your gifts. Do not fear to express your gifts. Do so with humility. Do so with bravery. God asks you to express love and to be His instrument of love. So, He clears the passage for you. So He makes possible many things so that you may indeed be His instruments. Pray and listen, listen and act, act and pray again, and listen and act. In this way God will speak to you and you will speak to others and act as God’s instruments of compassion and love, uplifting, bringing forth the Will of God into the world. This is what your soul desires, beloved and beautiful children. So you will find your way upon the journey of service. Step out from your doorway and walk into the world, and God will guide you. God will show you the way. You will find opportunities of service, some very simple, indeed, a gesture, a smile, a prayer for another, others more complex. Indeed, you must be guided every step. You must know your way with sure footfalls upon the path that God lays before you and shows you what must be done. 

May God ignite within each of you, beloved souls, the capacity, the perception, the wisdom, the love to be His instruments in the world. In this way, magnificent reflections of God’s blessings will be manifest through each of you. You will know great joy in this and you will be empowered by love as all will fall into place in  your journey forward. You have many questions, I know. But you must seek your soul’s wisdom for the answers. It will come in prayer, contemplation, rumination of the truth. 

God bless you, beloved children of God. I bring you a blessing to uphold you and to help awaken you to the truth. Look to God for all things and so, the answers come with His Touch upon you. God bless you, beloveds. I am Confucius and I come in love. God bless you.
