# Pray for Those Who Are Still Closed

December 25<sup>th</sup>, 2023

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Beloved received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now. I am John the Beloved. I seek to remain with you throughout this prayer to uplift you all, to bring to you the message of peace from our dear brother, who is Master of the Celestial Heavens. It is at this time when souls turn to God, or to whom they believe is God. Yet, in their yearnings, there are yearnings for truth. There are yearnings for happiness and joy. For many, there are yearnings for peace.

I say to you that my brother, who is the Prince of Peace, continues to work toward this end. Upon those places where there are upheavals in men's souls, he brings light to them. He brings peace and calm to them. It is for them to open their souls and allow their feelings, their soul perceptions and their knowings to experience what he brings along with the message, that they too may receive this gift of Love, which brings the peace.

We all pray deeply and sincerely for this profound peace to be brought to each one of our brothers and sisters upon the Earth and even into the spirit world, where many still suffer the consequences of their lives upon a spiritually bereft Earth. It is a place so difficult to truly comprehend the love that is available and the love that can be given to them and expressed by them.

This is your work, to help the Earth, to help the souls upon the Earth open to what the Father has to give, to help this Earth become a more amenable, loving, caring, uplifting and cherished place in which to spend a material life. We continue to help you as you pray. We ask you to pray even more and more deeply as these changes come into the Earth. Pray for those souls who are still closed, who are still burdened and who cannot fathom love in their lives. Pray for those dear brothers and sisters who are in such need. I will continue to pray with you, as will many of us who are here also.

God bless you, my dear children of our Father. May your lives be enriched with this Love, this day and always. I am your brother. I am John. I love you dearly, each and every one of you, those seen and those unseen. God bless you.
