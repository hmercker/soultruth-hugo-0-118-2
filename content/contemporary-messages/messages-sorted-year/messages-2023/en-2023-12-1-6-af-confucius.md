Confucius received by Al Fike

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Confucius. We thank you for your gentle respect toward our efforts together. How important it is to have harmony and to coordinate our efforts in such a way that all the components and parties concerned are in harmony and unity.

Love brings unity and harmony. Does it not? This is what we all pray toward, my beloved and beautiful friends upon the Earth. No one is put before the other. We are all equals in the eyes of God. We are all loved equally in the eyes of God. Some are further along the path of soul development and awakening than others. Some are strong in this love. Some wish to be strong in this love but find it difficult to go beyond the barriers of their own fears and conditions. This Earthly condition is difficult, is it not, for you to progress easily? Yet you have found the most powerful force, the most powerful way to counteract the conditions of your world and the conditions in your inner world.

Utilise these things within you, my beloved friends. Utilize God’s blessings upon you. Utilise all that is of light and goodness to help you walk the path of love, help you to awaken to God, and all that is of God. As you awaken my friends, as you come closer to that which is truth, that which is of light, then all your concerns, your judgments, and your illusions dissipate in the clarity and light of God and God’s Love. Would it not be better to be shining forth in joyous communion with your Heavenly Father, than to concern yourselves about the corruption and darkness of your world? How this takes up much of your thoughts and your fears. My beloved friends, there has always been darkness and corruption. The scale in your world at this time is immense. It is a force to reckon with. We understand this. You understand this.

To take the stance of a warrior, to say “I shall overcome these things,” is to think of yourself in far greater terms than you are. The only force that will dissipate the darkness is the force and Hand of God. You must pray for this. You must see the way forward. Yes, you may play a small part in understanding and teaching the falsity that is so prevalent in the human condition, but this is not the main thrust of our work. It is not what you are needed to do. It is to be a channel of love, to be a strength of love, to be powerful in love. This is the greatest antidote of all. Is it not?

My beloved friends, my beloved friends, we are here to receive the great gift, so that we may move forward in loving and powerful ways for the goodness and blessing of humanity. There is much, much goodness within humanity, but it is often overshadowed by other forces. You must compel your brothers and sisters toward this goodness, toward their own souls, toward what is a truth within them. An understanding that comes as the soul awakens, and you become, and others become, a force to reckon with in light and love.

God seeks to use you. You’ve been told this many times, beloveds, many times. I ask you, and I encourage you, to be those little birds that fly so high into the light of love. Seeking, seeking the transformation of this light, this love within, so that the songs you sing will be harmonious and beautiful, and that of God’s creation and intention for each of you, beloveds. You each carry your own song, your own unique ways, blessings and gifts. Hold them up and express them well without inhibition or fear, but in joy, acknowledging with great reverence the gifts that God has given you. That you may express them well and truly in harmony with God’s Will.

Confucius loves you, such beautiful souls, such beautiful souls. Birds with plumage, unique to each one. Shall we fly with God together and sing our songs that will be in such harmony together in the love and light of God’s Touch, beloved souls? Beloved souls, we are one in God, in love, in joy, in all that we are. Harmony is expressed in unique ways. God bless you. God bless you all. I am Confucius, and I love you so. Oh, I love you so, my precious friends. God bless you. God bless you in the bliss of God.
