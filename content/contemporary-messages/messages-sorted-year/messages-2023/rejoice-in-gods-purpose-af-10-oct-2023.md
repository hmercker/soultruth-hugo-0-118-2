# Rejoice in God’s Purpose!

Laurelville, PA, U.S.A. (Pre Retreat)

Received by Al Fike  

I am  Keea Atta Kem. The angels rejoice at your coming together, beautiful lights for God in loving harmony and communion, acknowledging the sisterhood and brotherhood that is forged out of God’s Love that grows within each of your souls, expanding so powerfully within you, creating a beautiful light together. This harmony, hues and colors that blend from each of you creating a rainbow of light that sustains you all and will sustain those who are coming. 

It is important that you continue to build upon this condition, this light together so that you may become a formidable force within the larger circle. Help us to be close to all who are present. Help God to bless each one powerfully, to awaken each one deeply, to bless each one profoundly with the power of His Touch upon the soul. 

Where there is joy, where there is this deep bond of love, where a compatibility and beautiful intermingling of the gifts that you possess, the power of God’s blessings  through you is great. The wonderment of the light upon this world is a reflection of each of your efforts combined into one beautiful force of love. The possibility of God working through you is great. Yes, we may accomplish this when you are at such distances away, but to do so while you are in the flesh adds a potency, a power to those gifts that are formidable and beautiful.

Oh, my beloved, beloved children of God, how blessed you are, how wonderful a light. How glorious the joy of your gathering together in this way. We rejoice! We rejoice at the accomplishment of this gathering of precious souls at this moment and in the moments to come. 

You truly do not see what can be accomplished together. But you have an inkling, a feeling and some expectation of what this means and how this may unfold. Nourish that insight, that joy, that expectation. For your souls know and your souls rejoice in this knowing. You feel it welling up within you, encompassing your being in joy. The acknowledgement of God’s great Hand in all of this, all of this, is the outcome of many prayers and much work from your angel friends to bring together this formidable light into the world. Each of you are deeply blessed.

Remember that you need one another to accomplish this work together. Each brings its component, that part of the beautiful light that is needed to pierce the world and be the catalyst for great change. You will be added to with others and you will feel and know the power of God’s blessings through you and among you. Be at peace, beloveds. Know that you are truly together for a purpose, an awakening, a deep blessing of the soul. In God’s loving Arms you rest as you have followed His calling upon you and through you. 

I am Keea and I love each one of you so dearly, so precious, so beautiful. So much of light is here as you gather together in loving communion with your Heavenly Father. God bless you. I love you, beloveds. I love you.
