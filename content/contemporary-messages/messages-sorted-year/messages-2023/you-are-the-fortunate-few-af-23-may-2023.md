With a great inflowing of His Love into your soul, my beloved, beloved friends, I am Keea Atta Kem, and I come to encourage you in joy, that you may feel the power of the redemptive Touch of God in your soul and rejoice at this beautiful gift that He has given you. For how many on your Earthly plane know of this gift in a way that you do, feel this gift in the way that you feel it and pray for this gift in the way that you pray for it? Very few, indeed, my beloved, beloved friends. So, you are the fortunate few in the world who have found such a gift so young and early in your awakening and developments as a being, a creation of God. 

God gives this gift to all who ask. Yet, few know to knock on this door. Few understand how to do so. They are without knowledge. They are without motivation. Yet, within them is a soul crying out to be released from the conditions that come within a life lived on Earth. You have found your way beloved, beloved souls. You have found your way to true joy and happiness. No matter your life circumstance, this flame that builds within you will warm your heart and awaken your soul and bring you to true understanding of what it is to be alive. 

In this joy, this light that you bear and carry in the world, others will feel upliftment and a blessing. For you have aligned yourself with God’s Will and work in the world, and in this way, many souls are touched. Though you may not be aware, I assure you that many souls are touched by your light. The world is touched by your light. So, it will go in the transformation of your world, this undercurrent of light that shall lift up the heaviest of conditions. The most difficult pain and error and darkness is weak compared to this light.
Be assured, beloveds, that you are God’s instruments, His channels of love, and in this, you bring the change. You are the harbingers of light. In this you allow God to work His gentle but powerful Touch upon the world. Have faith in your abilities and your gifts and your light. Have faith in all that you carry in this simple and innocent way, this true knowledge of God’s Touch and Love so that nothing will inhibit or obstruct you in your instrumentality. In the way in which you serve God does not have to be expressed in great fanfare and acknowledgment from others. It is the subtle touch, the undercurrent of light that is working to loosen and dissolve the darkness. You carry it with you, beloveds, wherever you go.

Allow your light to shine. Feel the joy of your soul that acknowledges the Touch of God and feels the quickening that comes with this Touch so that, in time, you will release all conditions. All that which is not of love will fall away from you. Step by step you walk upon the Earth, shedding this old cloak of pain and donning this beautiful garment of love. I see it with each and every one of you. Some just begin this journey, while others are well along the path. But each are equally loved by God. Each soul is being touched deeply by God. You are His child precious, precious beyond price, loved beyond all understanding, given all the blessings, all that God can give to uphold you and awaken you in love. 

You are His children, as are all of us, a great family that exalts in the love of God. We are His children, and in this we know great joy, great upliftment, great truth, great knowings of the soul. The journey will take you to many places and uncover many truths. It will bring you to that place where the soul rejoices and is predominant within you. It is so very close, beloveds, so very close within your grasp. Seek the blessing of God’s Love and you will come ever closer to soul's awakening to the exultation of love and at-onement with God. The light is upon you and so the blessings pour forth. Drink deep these living waters. Open yourselves wide and be with your Creator who loves you so. 

I love you so, beloveds. I am Keea-Atta-Kem and I love you so. God bless you and keep you in His Love. God bless you and awaken you in light and truth and all that is of God. I love you and I am close. God bless you.
