# Comments on Levels of Healing

November 7<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Mylora received by Al Fike

Friends, I am Mylora and I come to bring my healing energies as do many angels to come to bring upliftment and light and healing to you, healing to your minds, healing to your  bodies, healing to your spirit and of course, the greatest healing of all is when God brings to you His love, the Divine Love to flow into your souls. The environment in which you live is contrary to many of these energies and blessings given. Humanity has disrupted the natural order of God’s creation to such a degree that the air that you breathe, what you consume into your bodies, many things lack the vitality and blessings that God has intended for His creations upon the Earth. And so each of you is in need of upliftment and support and blessings to neutralize these conditions. We are happy to help you in this regard. God wishes for you to be in the light, to be vital, to be alive in every respect. In this way, you become a potent instrument for His will.

Yet, there are many conditions that are contrary and often work to bring you away from the light, to bring you away from harmony within your bodies, within your minds, within your spirits. Yet the harmony of your soul persists. It is only you that can bring that which neutralizes the energies and light of your soul, that you create the encrustations around you, my beloved friends through your acts, through your thoughts, through whatever condition you may sustain that is not in harmony with love. Even here, we make great effort to help you to dismantle these encrustations. But in truth, the real potency of healing comes from the great blessings of God’s love. This dissolves the darkness. This dismantles the encrustations. This brings you into greater harmony with God and the laws of God.

Indeed, there are many contrary elements to your Earthly life and God in His mercy and wisdom and love for you ensures that many blessings come to help neutralize these contrary conditions. You must work with God. You must seek to be in alignment with all that is in harmony with God. In this way, with your efforts within and our efforts without, we may help  uplift you up into higher and higher conditions of love. And this is what you seek when you come here. This is what you seek when your pray.This is what may come with your efforts and expressions to God. Do not allow the Earthly conditions to weigh you down, my beloved brothers and sisters. Be strong and able in love, to be a channel of light, to think in ways of love and compassion, of wisdom and truth, to be all of these things will bring you great joy and great vitality. For the power of light and love is great. It can heal. It can uplift. It can bring joy and it can bring truth.

So as you seek the Essence of God, the essence of truth, the essence of light, you are strong within every aspect. So light penetrates every part of you. You will know the vitality and joy of life. Be that beautiful soul, that beautiful being that God intends for you to be. Let go of the burdens and do not encourage more but seek to be free from these things that burden you. As you do so, greater blessings flow into you. Greater light comes around you. Greater truth inspires you. Beautiful angels come close to you. All works in your favor, beloved souls. All are blessings that come as the laws are obeyed. The attraction brings the gifts, the intentions and desires within, the longings of your soul, the workings of your mind, the deeper workings of soul-mind, spirit-mind. All of these things coming together, in harmony working together for greater light and indeed, you may be a powerful channel of love in this way through the obedience of laws of God’s creation, so simple, yet you find it so difficult.

You have all that you require, my friends, to be in the light always, to live in light, to express light, to truly be of light that God has created and nurtures with His love. My beloved friends, I come to you with great desire, with great love. I come to you as a blessing of healing. I come to you because I love you, my beloved friends. I am Mylora and I am with you, along with many others in this sacred time of prayer. God bless you deeply and fully. God bless you in love.
