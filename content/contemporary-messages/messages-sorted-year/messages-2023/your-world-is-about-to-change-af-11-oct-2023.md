May the gift of the Father’s Love continue to awaken you, beloved souls. I come, I am Jesus. I come to you in your prayers and efforts to bring greater light to this world of yours, to all who seek greater light and truth. I am with you in these efforts always. My beloveds, my disciples, I am with you. 

The pace and tempo of your work is about to change. You will find great demands upon each of you. But you will feel compelled and open to the possibilities of the work that lays ahead. You will find great fulfillment as you step forward in this work. For when you do God’s work, then you are blessed and you are blessed mightily, beloved souls. I ask you to continue to open yourselves to your guidance, God's Will that will continue to infuse your consciousness and guide you forward upon the path Divine. 
When you ask to be God’s instruments, then you cannot put limitations on what that is. Instead, you must come to acknowledge the Will of God, the guidance given and all its details, all its possibilities unfolding in your life. I come to assure you, that all that is meant to be in God’s plan shall unfold accordingly. It is for you to comply and to be in harmony with this plan.

For each of you were born with a purpose and a destiny. Each of you will come to realise this purpose and destiny. Nothing shall hold you from it, beloved souls. You will be protected. You will be in the light always and the joy of service will be great. The joy of love flowing powerfully and beautifully through you to many souls will sustain you and help you to overcome any inhibitions, any doubts, any fears. You will find yourself upon a road so clearly laid before you. Ahead you will travel and walk as God’s instruments. You will understand why you walk upon this road. You will know the guidance and details. You will come to understand with wisdom of the soul, how you may proceed and what the purpose of your efforts will be. Many angels will surround you and uphold you.

The world is in great need of each of you. Each of you have a great gift to give, a great light to shine upon this world of yours. I only pray that you see and understand that which I speak. That you will come to truly know that there is purpose, that there is a journey ahead, so vital, so blessed, so needed. That you will not shirk from it, but boldly step forward in the great gift and light of God’s blessings and will upon you, beloveds. 
There is so much yet to do, so many journeys to take, so many souls to reach out to. The world is crying out for guidance and blessings, for the Love of God to bring the soothing blessing upon the soul, His great Love changing the very nature of each soul, so that it may truly be fulfilled in what is intended and what God wishes for each of His children. 

May His blessings continue to unfold in your lives. Know that I am with you, that my hand is upon you as your brother. That my love for you is great and I truly see your destinies which gives my heart great joy. May you see as I see, the purpose that God has laid before you and what is truly unfolding in your life. His Love shall continue to sustain you, change you and awaken you. This is His plan for each of you and so it shall be, beloveds, so it shall be, in all its glory and beauty. The power of God’s Hand upon you shall change the world, shall be the precursor to a new world.

May God bless you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I shall walk with you always. You may call upon me in need, desire to be in great alignment with God, light and all that is of truth, all that is of His Love. Know that I, too, am with you in these moments as you reach out to your Heavenly Father. I, too, pray with you. I, too, see what you see and more and shall share with you my insights and understanding of the journey that must be taken and shall be taken in love, harmony and peace. 

God bless you, my beloveds. God bless you in His great Love. Open yourselves to this touch from the Holy Spirit, that shall be your destiny, forevermore. My love is with you. I am Jesus and I am with you. God bless you.
