# Know You are Being Used!

September 5<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Matthew received by Al Fike

Bless you, my beloved friends, I am Matthew. God’s plan unfolds with each day, does it not? The blessings and gifts that come to you each day, the opportunities and situations that you encounter each day, these things are a reflection of God’s Will in your life. At times you are aware and at times you are not. But what is most important, is that you pray to be used as God’s instruments with each day. As you do so, and you are committed with faith and dedication to service and love, so the light builds around you, within you, so God’s work intensifies all around you. You may not see this clearly and distinctly in your daily life. Indeed, there is much that is happening around you and within your life that is a reflection of God’s Will and the flow of His Love through you.

When there are not mortals surrounding you, often it is spirit who are with you, those on the lower planes who are seeking truth, those who have seen your light and your capacity as a channel of light and love. So, they come close, and, often it is both. There are those in your life that you pray for, connections made through the Lattice of Light, that is a powerful conduit of blessings as you pray. There are those who are close to you physically who are benefitting from your light, strangers and loved ones, many who are availing themselves of your instrumentality, your gifts.

It is important that you see clearly your purpose. That purpose has little to do with the material world, or the material conditions of your world and your life. Rather, it has much to do with your soul in relationship and communion with God and through the conduit that is made in this relationship. You are God’s instruments, an eager channel for the love and blessings that flow through you from God. Of course, many angels are with you, surrounding you, a phalanx of angels, that at times is so powerful and great that, indeed, a tremendous light is formed in your vicinity and this, too, draws many to you, not only in the flesh, but in spirit.

My beloved and beautiful friends, continue with your prayers and desires to serve, to be that instrument of love, truth and light for God and for humanity. There is much, much work to be done and with each day as you commit yourselves as I have suggested, then you build upon what is possible, your gifts, the flow. It is like anything in your life that is a gift, that is a response to your actions, it flows more readily when you practice and when it is conscious, until there comes a point where everything flows reflexively, and at times unconsciously, so that you may walk in the world as an active and powerful channel wherever you go, whatever you do. As this light builds within you, as the gifts and faculties of your soul grow, and are expressed and become a fluid and beautiful part of your being, then this gift that you long for, this gift of manifestation that is a part of your effort and desire to serve in the world, will come more readily as a response to your growth and expansion in light.

All works hand in hand, beloved souls. All requires your efforts and consciousness, desire and practice. Think of each day as a gift from God. It unfolds at times in surprising ways, unanticipated ways, and at other times, it is part of your routines and your usual conscious efforts in the world. Both are important. Both bring some blessing, some gift through you. Do not underestimate the potentials that are within your life, within your daily life, within your beings. For in this service, in the ways that you respond and express yourselves, in this, a lively walk through life, much can be accomplished. God uses you with each day and will use you more effectively and intensely as you grow with the Father’s Love within your soul.

May God bless you upon this journey of service and light, joy and awakening. May you truly find how effective and beautiful you are as God’s servants in the world, and do so joyfully, with acknowledgement, with building confidence, yet humility, all of these aspects of your soul coming alive, being expressed and being utilised by God. God bless you, my friends. I am Matthew. My love is with you as always. May you be blessed this day with many opportunities to serve your Creator. God bless you. My love is with you. God bless you.
