Indeed you are connected with your friends, my beloveds. I am Paul, Paul of Tarsus. The world needs to be covered by the Lattice of Light. Great power comes from this. A power to heal and transform may be attained through these interconnections between you and others. As you pray together, the lattice grows in power and light and in its capacity to reach out into the world, it can be interconnected strand by strand from one soul to another. God gives this blessing to you and to all those who are praying together at this time. At other times, He utilizes your interconnection so that the lattice may grow. God’s intention is to cover this world in light, crisscrossing the Earth, containing the Earth in light. There is much you can do to support this effort as you continue to weave bonds of light among others. 

As you reach out to the dear soul who is longing for a connection, so are you not another weaver of light in the world creating a bond that shall have many aspects and purpose to it? The light of your soul touching the light of another soul, the intention you have of coming into alignment with another with similar intention, the power of this shall indeed help God to change the world and to gather His children together in light. He provides the ways and means that this may be done. He gives to you the capacity to weave the web. So, the light proliferates. The strands become more complex and deliberate. As you are the weaver helping God to create this fabric of light, be clear in your intentions, beloved souls. Allow God to utilize you to create this lattice. May the weave of light be tight and beautiful so that the world benefits from your efforts. 

God has many ways and means of healing the Earth but something you must know and understand is that He needs instruments upon the Earth, those who are willing to be His channels, His instruments for light in the world. Thus, your bond with God, this holy connection and blessing, must be strong and clear so that God may utilize you in these many ways, part of His complex plan for the salvation of humanity. You cannot be passive, beloved souls. It is an active thing. Indeed, as you act with love, so you participate in this beautiful plan. Step forward with surety and grace, purity of love and intention, seeking to serve God and to serve humanity.

There is much for you to do. There is much that is God’s plan. Yet, in the vast numbers of humanity, very few consciously participate in this effort for the healing of the globe and all within it. It is for you to be a clear and powerful channel for God. There are others that God wishes for you to connect with, to weave the light toward,and for them to also weave light toward others. This is how the web proliferates and the lattice becomes strong and potent in its capacity for light. So, I say to you, beloved souls, be in the Grace of God, and long for His Love to continue to infill your soul with light. This fuels the capacities and blessings that flow through you. You become the perfect weaver of light through your gifts and desire to serve, and God utilizing you to bring forth His intention to uplift humanity beyond the conditions of today toward the potentials of tomorrow.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Paul. I am happy to speak to you and to speak to all those who are listening and who will listen for there are efforts in your world at this moment that involve your brothers and sisters. They too need to hear my words for they too are weavers of light. God bless you all. My love is with you. God’s Love is always with you. May you continue to seek His blessing and be in alignment with His Will and keep you in light. My love is with you all. God bless you.
