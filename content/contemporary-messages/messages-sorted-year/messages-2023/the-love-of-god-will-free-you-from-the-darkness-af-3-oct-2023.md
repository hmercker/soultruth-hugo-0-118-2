May there be peace on Earth, beloved souls. This is what we seek to bring to your earthly planes and I know that you do as well. I am Matthew. We must bring peace into ourselves, peace all around us. In doing this, we bring peace into the world. It is when we are tempted to engage in judgment, argument and conflict of all kinds that peace is not obtained, but destroyed. In indulging in this condition, you take from yourself the condition of peace within you. Thus, after efforts to build this peace, to pray together, to be blessed with God’s Hand that brings peace, **you tear it down with a few indulgent and judgemental thoughts about others** and must build again that structure, that condition of peace.  

**I urge you, my beloved friends, consider your thoughts.** Consider your words and consider your actions. That if you are truly to be that individual, that light that you pray to be, you must begin with disciplining your thoughts and disallowing those things that are not of love within your mind. If you cannot do this simple thing, then how can you truly be God’s channels of love and light in the world?

I also wish for you to know that God does not judge you. That even though you may indulge in these things, you are not judged for them. In certain circumstances, you judge yourselves and you pay the consequences, for you damage your own spiritual light, but it is not God, nor is it us in the Celestial Kingdom, who cast aspersions towards you. It is merely when you are a part of this cycle of darkness, this destructive force that is of the human condition, that you suffer more greatly than those you may cast your aspersions upon. 

The law dictates that when a condition is formed and, of course, humanity is able with their gift of free will to create whatever condition they like, thus, when it is dark, it is cast upon them even more fully than it is upon others. Thus this condition continues to be strengthened, empowered by the thoughts and actions of humanity. You pray to counteract these conditions. You pray to be a light. So, you must be within the harmony, Truth and Laws of God’s Love. 

This is, as you well know, a gradual effort to rise above the human condition. When you begin and you see yourself for who you are, it is often disheartening. Yet you have been told, and I assure you this is true, that when you make efforts to dispel the darkness around you, within you, through prayer, through discipline, through actions of love, indeed, the laws work to your favour. We have spent much time teaching you about these laws. There is much literature available to you to understand these laws. Yet, the simple fact remains that it is in the practice, dedication and faith toward receiving the great Love of God that the dissolution of these conditions around you will become permanent, for the Love ensures this to be the case.

Unfortunately, with the Law of Free Will, you may reapply these conditions by your thoughts and actions. Yet because you are a stalwart within the truth of love, it is unlikely that you will do so. You may trip and fall at times. You may be caught up in the moment and react in unloving ways, but these conditions are not permanent. The true condition of your soul is that of light. As that light expands, so the encrustations of your soul continue to fall away and are healed. As this happens, your inclination toward indulging in darkness also dissipates. So the laws work in your favour, strengthen you, bring you to greater light and clarity. You become a being of light, rather than part of the great wash of humanity that is not of light. 

Continue to seek for the highest, beloved souls. Continue to monitor your own thoughts and discipline your own thoughts. Be in the highest and most beautiful condition that you can be. In this, you will feel the benefits. You will be uplifted. You will know us to be close and you will feel the Hand of God upon you. You may walk in His grace through the efforts that you make, through applying the laws that you understand, and become free of all those burdens and conditions that bring you pain and distress. 

God allows each and every soul the possibility of circumventing their pain, of healing the darkness, of bringing light into themselves. It is a matter of choice, effort, dedication, prayer and faith that all will be rectified with the Hand of God upon them. You know this well, my beloved and beautiful friends. You are blessed to know this truth and you shall be blessed in times to come evermore fully, beautifully and deeply. You will look back on those times when you were in pain and living to some degree in darkness ,and realise that you have been deeply blessed. That within you a joy will well up, a feeling of accomplishment, an acknowledgment toward God and His great efforts to lift you up from these conditions.  

You are blessed, my beloved brothers and sisters. Though you have known heartache, hardship, darkness and pain, you now know the path to take that will insure your freedom from such things. That you will truly be healed and truly be awakened.  My beloved brothers and sisters, we walk this path together. We walk it with the Angels of the Celestial Kingdom, with our beloved brother, Jesus, with bright spirits and even those from other realms. They walk with us in the light of truth. They join us in the march toward at-onement with God.

You are blessed, beloved souls. You know the road that you walk upon. You feel the blessings of God. You are beautiful lights and shall come to know the purity and wonderment of your own soul in time. When that time comes to pass into our side of life, you will go to a place that is of light. You will have reaped the rewards of your efforts on Earth and you will understand that the journey continues forever.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Matthew and my love for you is great. I honour your efforts, your journey toward light and truth. I come to help you, to sustain this journey with you and to love you. God bless you, beloved souls. God bless you and keep you in His Love.
