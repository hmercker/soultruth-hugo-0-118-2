# Spirit Influence and the Law of Attraction

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

It is I, Ann Rollins, your sister in Divine Love. I wish to speak about spirit influence and the Law of Attraction and how these two things are connected and of their importance. In the prayer that James Padgett received from Jesus, there is a request for protection from the lower ones, the lower spirits with the words *“who so constantly surround you”* and endeavor to turn your thoughts away from God to the things of this world, and not just the pleasures of this world, but the entanglements, the concerns. Spirits who are close to the earth plane or in the hells constantly seek connection and there are of course varying degrees of darkness and light. 

Where those spirits in the hells love to create commotion, or influence someone who is angry to get even angrier or to do violence and depending on the mental condition and state of the person they are influencing, this can cause great harm and you know people that have very difficult mental challenges who commit crime will say *"the voices told me to do it"* and they often don’t even know why because they are very susceptible to spirit influence. Those spirits who are close to the earth plane but a little higher generally like to just be with their loved ones or perhaps they are trying to work out something that was unfinished in their lives on earth and their influence is generally benign and often helpful. 

I wish all of you to be aware of the immensity of spirit influence upon the earth plane and we ask you this, we encourage you this activation of your prayer life because the Law of Attraction brings to your soul what it is seeking. In the material world, the material mind, there is attraction to accumulation of earthly things and as you all know this is the way of the world and those on the spiritual path of divine love, you who pray for the essence of the Creator to be in your souls, you not only receive protection, but you create a light, and when you walk in the love of God and in the light, you bring this into every space and as was read earlier the words of our dear brother Yogananda, one soul in the love of God outshines an army, outshines the world in the higher vibration, in the grace of God’s love. 

It is so important to be aware of what you attract, to stay in a prayerful place in your soul and I know many of you in my observations, when you are challenged during your day, you do pray, you ask God for assistance, and we come. The more you do this, the more it becomes your state of being, the more you become a channel of light and love in the world. 

Is this not what you wish to be? Is it not how you wish to serve? It does not require any money or material things. It only requires some time and for you to be aware of the longings in your soul to be in the love of God and walk this earth as a blessing. I shall step back and be in this beautiful circle of love and light and I thank you for taking my message and I give you my blessing in the love of God and all of us here. I am your celestial sister in Christ. I am Ann Rollins. I love you. God bless you.
