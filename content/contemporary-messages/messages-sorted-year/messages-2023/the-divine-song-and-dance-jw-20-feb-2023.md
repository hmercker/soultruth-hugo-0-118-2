It is I your brother in the love of God. I am Inayat Khan. I come again to speak of song and dance, the arts, and the music of the spheres. On the earth plane there is great variety of music although not a great variety of Celestial channeled music through mediums. Love songs are everywhere, reaching for love, despairing for lost love, extolling the joys of falling in love and so on.  

There are songs that you call the blues and everywhere in the world these songs allow the musicians and the singers to express the deep longing of the heart to rise above their troubles. What is their purpose? To rise above the blues of course. 
  
There are songs and dances of celebration. These also tend to be more in line with instant gratification or shall I say, momentary bliss and yet this is good for if you forget your troubles in a moment of joy, that is good. There are wedding dances as there are war dances, there are sexual dances and healing dances, dances of joy and physical expression and so forth.
 
You may ask yourself what kind of song or dance do I wish to bring to the world? And whether you are a musician or singer, an artist or dancer, each one has a song in their heart. A song of their soul longing for the Creators love. Whenever you create and you do so with the desire to bring the love of God into your creation, you draw the Celestial kingdom to help you co create with God your gift, and whether it be dance, a painting, a song, a film, a book, or a poem, all these arts become transformed and  sacred. 
  
As your lives become more and blessed, as your souls become more and more transformed you may bring this sacredness, this magnetism of God’s love into the world. For all true art is intended to lift one up, to rise above the world, and to awaken one in love.  Spiritual art awakens one to God’s love for it contains the deep aspirations of the longing soul to be at one with its Creator. True spiritual art is aspirational and inspirational on the highest levels. It is not self-serving, self-indulgent or vain, but full of hope and freedom in the bliss of God’s love. How much your world needs songs and art in Divine Love!
   
In every sphere where there is love, there is beautiful music and art. As one approaches the Celestial realms these become transcendent above and beyond anything in the physical realms. And in spirit one finds that everything has a note and the whole Universe is singing the song of never-ending Creation. 
  
So, if you find yourself with the blues, reach for song, make it your prayer, allow the music, the art, to touch your heart that God may touch your soul so that you may be the blessing you wish to be to the world. And so, you are! My dear brothers and sisters, you have chosen well. May God bless each one of you with the joy, with the glory, with the sanctity, with the safety and with the peace of His love. God bless you! I am your brother in Christ in God’s love, Inayat Khan.
