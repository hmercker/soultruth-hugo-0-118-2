The world shall be blessed beloveds, awakening within their souls is coming. I am your brother and friend, Jesus, and I come to assure you that the work that you do to awaken the world is having its effect. Though you may seem to perceive that you are ineffectual in your efforts, I come to assure you that each time you pray, each time you reach for God, each time you are blessed by His Love, you become a living affirmation of the Truth and you are my disciples because of this.
 
The world sleeps a deep slumber, unwilling to be roused and to come to know that God is there. Yet the great bell toll is sounding for each soul, rousing them awake, bringing them to prayer. Some hear this toll and know its significance; some continue to ignore and to recede back into their slumbers. Indeed, as time marches on, this toll will become louder and the invitation to come to God in prayer will be given to all souls upon this world. Some may refuse, and many will answer this call. Do not doubt this, beloveds. You are far ahead of this great transformation that comes because you have answered the toll early in its expression.
 
You are the harbingers of Light and Truth. You are the souls that long to be awakened. You are the light bringers in the world. Indeed, you will join others who will create a great network of light to help awaken the world and bring humanity to God not in submission and not in fear. Yet, often it comes with turmoil and confusion, with the soul desiring as it always does, the comfort that God has to give. You will help to bring stability and Truth to many. You will be the anchor of Light, that beam stretching out into the world, calling those souls who can see and feel the draw of your soul to them. God will use you in many ways, beloveds. God will find the avenue, the way in which you may serve and you may walk upon the Earth as a light. This is preordained, and it is for you to find your way, to put one foot in front of the other, step by step, you will follow the road to God has ordained for you. It is for you to accept this invitation that God has placed before you and to have the faith, courage, strength and commitment to walk this road as God's instruments. Ask in your daily prayers to be guided,  ask to be shown the way, ask to know your gifts and capacities so that God will use you as his servants. Beloved, beloved brothers and sisters, we are on the cusp of a new age, the dawning of greater light in your world. 

It is for you to accept the transformation that is coming and be a part of that transformation in an active and proactive way. To truly be God's children of Light for you stand here together, seeking for the highest gift, the gift of His Love. Proclaim this gift as yours as you reach for it and long for it. It is given in your prayers as you ask for the benediction that is His Soul blessing your soul with Its Essence. Walk together, beloveds, walk in harmony, know that you are a network that spans much of the Earth. And this will grow and expand exponentially. God's angels are working towards this goal, influencing many souls who are seeking and longing and yet know not how to fulfill this longing. Express this Truth in your life, put forward the Truth wherever you may be, however you may utilize what is available to you to communicate to others. In this way, those who are seeking will be guided to your communications, will be guided to your soul, your being in the world.

Great work is afoot and greater work will unfold. It will awaken many to this Truth. God's plan is to bring many to His Love and his bosom. Once the numbers of souls are enough, this Truth will catch fire in the world and will be known by many. It is a formidable plan. It requires many who are dedicated at this time to bring the fulfillment of this plan. Though God is blessing this world with many beautiful benedictions, energies as you call it, to help awaken humanity, there must be those who trigger this awakening, who come forward and point the way to God and help others hear the bell toll that draws them, that gives the invitation to be with God. It is for you to consider, beloved souls, what you might do, how you may proceed in guidance and in action, giving the Truth of God's Love to the world.
 
Those who are affirming their commitment and put their desires to God to serve will be upheld by angels, will be guided powerfully, and will know this Truth with such clarity and light that they will be capable of leadership, of demonstrating the Truth in many ways. This I promise you, beloved souls, this I promise to all who walk with me and walk with the Truth that is God Who loves you so.

God bless you, beloveds. I bless you with peace. I bless you with joy. I bless you with the Light of God shining down upon you. As the Holy Spirit touches you, open wide to this gift and know that you are blessed with the highest and greatest Truth and Love. I am with you as you are with me. We are a brotherhood and sisterhood of Love and we shall walk the distance of the Earth to bring this blessing to many, to be the harbingers of Light. God bless you, beloveds, God bless you. Know that I love you, I am Jesus and I love you so, my beloved brothers and sisters upon the Earthly plane, I love you so. God bless you. God bless you.
