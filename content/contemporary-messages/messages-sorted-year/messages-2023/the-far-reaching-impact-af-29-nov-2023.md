Greetings to you all, my friends, I am James Padgett. You have been speaking about me in my work and my life so you have drawn me into your circle. I would like to stress that when I made a decision to enter into service in the way that I did, not knowing the outcome, but feeling the impetus to come to know my departed wife and others through the gift of mediumship, that this set in motion a great work. I began innocently enough, and not knowing much about these ways and means of communication. Yet, through this effort and what transpired, in many ways you are all here today knowing about the truth of the great Divine Love, this gift from God.

You see one small decision, one small step has led to a great work and has brought you together because you know of this truth. Of course, I do not take credit for this fact. Indeed I made my contribution. I did so naively, innocently. Nonetheless, I helped to create the momentum necessary in order to bring these truths to the Earth plane. Now you know of your beloved brother Jesus. Now you know of the apostles. Now you know of many spirits who are within the Celestial Kingdom and bright spirits who are working their way towards it. As are you, my friends, as are you.

I ask you, what decisions are you making that will lead to the next revelations, the next mighty works that will bring greater understanding of this truth, bring others towards it, inspiring them, opening the door, the great opening to truth? Each of you are gifted. Each of you have many things you may offer as God's instruments in the world. What small decisions have you made? Certainly you have made the decision to come together. Each of you are eager to bring this truth to many others. Each of you has some part of that great puzzle, that great plan that God has to awaken the world, to change the world, to bring greater truth to the world. So that in time humanity might live in peace, might live in truth, light and harmony with one another.

Do you know the part you play? Do you understand what it is that you must do in order to express this purpose that God has put within you? You feel the momentum of it. You have some inkling of it. Some of you even realise and know the plan that lies ahead. 

Yet within each of you, to some degree, is some reticence and some resistance because you also ascribe to the reality of the human condition. This draws you away at times. Your minds often contemplate and seek to contradict these truths because you have put such great credence in logic and linear thinking. Yet within your soul is a different form of awareness, of the ability to know and understand the truth of life, the truth of God's universe, and the truth of your place within it. This is where you must go. You must delve into these things. For this will bring you a higher truth. This will bring you to that place of surety and knowing. All the doubts and the fears will fall away. You will know a joy, a completeness, a knowing that will set you on the path of great service to humanity. 

Each of you have fallen into this great path of love. It is not that you planned this, but rather that God opened a door. That door was opened by God utilising an instrument, someone, to assist you, to turn your focus upon it. In focusing upon it you felt a great attraction, an urge to continue to explore it. This is the result of God's plan. This is the result of someone making a decision to serve, to offer truth to the world so that in some way the doors were opened for you. How might you open doors for another? How might you  acknowledge the great gift that God has given you in a way that expresses love, truth, gratitude and joy?

It is for you to make that decision. It is for you to seek out the ways and means that you may express God's Will and the truth as you know it. Much is given to each one of you, much is given. You are upheld and uplifted by angels. You are given all that you require to be that instrument for God. Indeed, with joy, with desire, with the impetus that is within your soul, you will truly express what it is that God wishes for you to do, and do so with joy and an understanding that you are in harmony with the Will of God. You will find great joy and peace within that place of harmony, of expression, of utilising your gifts for the benefit of others. 

We set you upon a course, my friends. We uphold you and uplift you. We give you what you require. We supply you with what you need to live a life in harmony. Great wisdom befalls you. Great love flows into you. Much is given. Seek the way of service. Seek the way of living this truth in every way and everything within your life. This will help usher in  the capacity and blessing to serve God, to know your purpose and to be fulfilled within it.  

I am so very pleased that you understand this great truth, that in some way I added to your lives through my dedications and my gifts. I am humbled by how this truth has grown in the world. Indeed, as you have spoken to one another, it needs greater ways and means of spreading this truth to others, giving them the opportunity to choose, to decide whether they would like to live within the realm, the great reality of God and the Love of God. 

Continue with your efforts, with your conversations, with reinforcing with one another the ideas and inspirations that you have in your thinking. For it is important that you come to clarity, resolve and expression in the light of the Truth of God and His Love. God bless you, my friends, truly lights in the world, truly beautiful lights in the world. I am James Padgett and my love is with you, always. I seek to help, to uphold and to inspire my friends upon the Earth who are God's servants. God bless you and keep you in His Love. My love is with you. God bless you.
