I know each of you well. We have had many conversations together in your sleep state, and I find it a great privilege to be able to support you all in your endeavors. You are so dedicated, each of you, in your own way. You seek greater truth and greater love, all those things of light, beauty, joy, and you seek to serve humanity, to bring this truth to many. So, together we make efforts, we cross barriers, and even within your own self you cross barriers that keep you from this work. You come to understand the Truth behind God’s Will and wisdom and guidance for you, and you are willing to go beyond those places which before would cause you trepidation and fear. Now you are strong in love and you seek to be God’s instruments in whatever way that He designates and guides you toward. Do you not see, it is a great leap forward to allow God to guide you along a road that may seem challenging to your minds but brings great joy to your souls? 

It is important that you see and live beyond those barriers, allowing the restrictions of your mind to recede so that the knowings of your soul may come forward. That you are secure in the Truth and Will and Love of God. This is your great calling and understanding in your life, that you may step forward and truly be that instrument that God wishes you to be, that you may be strong and clear without doubt or fear, that your mind may not interfere so much with your efforts and your perspectives. That there be clarity and peace within you, the joy rising up from your soul so that you may truly be in the Light of God, in the Truth of God’s Love, and express this in everything that you do in your life and everything that you are in your life. 

Do not allow the template of a life lived within the paradigms of human consciousness, rather, work beyond this, truly understanding the Will of God and the Truth of God and the truth of living with God, with His Love, within His Will, the flow of His Will, and magnificence. In this way wondrous things will be your experience in life. Your channel and instrumentality in the world will be extraordinary, beloved souls. It will be without the trepidations and pain that I had as I tried to follow God’s Will and yet continued to entertain my own fears, my own resistance. This caused me great pain, but still, in many ways I overcame this, as will you, and you will come to know the great joy that is the fulfillment of your destinies of God’s plan for each of you. This will come with each day, the change, the insights, the blessings that will be with each day. 

You will find your way, you will know your way, and you will release all that is in your way. My beloved and beautiful friends, I am so pleased to see you all together and many more coming. What a glorious opportunity you have for yourselves in what is coming, a blessing for each of you will help you to overcome many barriers. You will know the joy of God’s Love with such intensity and joy that you will wonder: *“Why did I resist, what is holding me from knowing this glorious knowing, wondrous, healing experience, expression of God’s Love?”* It builds within each of you, beloved souls, and will continue to build, coming to a crescendo where you will truly be changed and truly be God’s instruments, clear, powerful, beautiful, of great light and wisdom and of great love, expressing the wonderment of life, the true potentials of life. These things will come to each of you in your own way, and you will know as you cross that threshold and are truly transformed in the Love of God. 

God bless you. I am Barbara and I love you. Oh, how I love each of you! Oh, how you are such beautiful souls and you will find your way as I found my way. Don’t let the barriers hold you back, the resistance hold you in stasis so that you cannot move back or forward. This will cause you great pain if you allow this to be. Allow yourself to let go and let God. I love you and I am close. God bless you, beloved souls.
