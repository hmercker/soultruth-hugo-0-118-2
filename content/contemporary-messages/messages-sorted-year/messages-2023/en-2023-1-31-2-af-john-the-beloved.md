John the Beloved received by Al Fike

I am John, John the Beloved. As you sing and send your praises to God, so you open the floodgates of heaven pouring down upon you in Light. You uplift yourselves from the human condition, this earthly place, to a place that is more in harmony with the condition of your soul. Often you do not know the condition of your soul. You do not feel in harmony or in alignment with it because you are engaged in all the distractions of the material world.

But in prayer you must be in alignment with your soul, aware, bringing the awareness of that which is truly you into consciousness, so that when you pray, you pray from the true part of you that is deep within. When this dear brother sings, you can feel his soul rising up, awakening in song and truth and light. Indeed, music can do this for the individual, can open the floodgates to God. So, you must find your way, my friends. Find that way to be in alignment with God, to truly have the awareness of your soul self-communing with God’s Soul. For this is where deep and meaningful experiences and blessings may come to you, so that consciously you may recognise these things, and the awareness may grow more acute as you travel that road from the material perspective to that of the soul.

It is something you must be well attuned and able to accomplish in your prayers, for if you are able to do so, then you may teach this to others. You may be the example that others require as you demonstrate the truth, so that they may see for themselves or feel the power of it. My beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters, you are continuing to prepare yourselves for the work that lies ahead. You are continuing to release those conditions that are not in harmony with this.

You gather in this Circle of Light so that you may affirm with one another the truth, the way to the truth, expression of the truth. My beloved friends, few take time as you do to sound the depths of your soul, to find God in those deep places within you. Yet, this is the way and means in which humanity may find harmony and peace in the world, the power of God’s Love transforming each soul one by one, coming to that place of resonance with God, opening themselves to God’s blessings, allowing the Holy Spirit to bring these deep blessings into the soul, longing for this, and finding the answers to your prayers and your questions.

The soul is a reservoir of truth. It lies within each individual. But it is for each individual to make that effort to awaken, to come to realise that other place of consciousness that exists within, that deep bell toll of truth that resonates within the individual. Go deep, my beloved and beautiful brothers and sisters. Go deep and find the still waters, the peace that passes all understanding, the Love Divine burning bright and awakening you to all the glories, all the wonderments that lay within and is of God.

God bless you. I am John. My love is with you. Pray deeply, beloveds. Go deep within and much will come with this, much will be realised through it, much will be experienced, in joy and bliss as your soul comes to know itself and know God. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
