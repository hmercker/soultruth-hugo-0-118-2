Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

Blessings to you, beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem. Each of you are being led to this pool of light, which feels like water, where you may bathe in this light and feel refreshed, awakened, uplifted. That within this pool are healing blessings, light penetrating every cell in your body. These lights are of different colours, various intensities. But they sparkle forth within this pool. They bedazzle your soul and bring upliftment and healing.

As you bathe, beloved souls, ask God to open your soul for the inflowing of His Love that you may intensify the light within you. That pool of light that grows and expands as you receive the great gift of love. Let these waters wash over you, beloveds, a gift from God. We surround you, holding and containing this light, these blessings for you.

Be like children frolicking in the waves. Feel the joy of it, the pleasure of it and how everything within you expands with it. Beloveds, immerse yourselves head to toe. Its warmth and buoyancy hold you in the suspension of light, bringing to you all the blessings and nourishment that you may require to be at peace, to be joyful, renewed.

Blessings to you, beloveds. I am Keea Atta Kem and we are together in the healing grace of God. Know that I love you and I am always with you as you pray and seek to be uplifted. God bless you, beloveds. God bless you.
