# More on Spirit Communication

I am here your brother and friend Judas. I wish to speak on the subject of spirit communication though perhaps from a different perspective than what you have been accustomed to hearing. You are well aware of having an intuition, a feeling that someone is near, whether they be in mortal form of spirit body. It is the same kind of intuition where you think of someone, and they call or perhaps show up at your doorway. It is the same with spirits. You draw them near by your thoughts and I would say most especially when you wish to communicate or be with them. Evidential mediumship<sup>1</sup> is the ability of the mind to perceive through intuition the presence of a spirit. 

Now you were all speaking about soul-to-soul communication which is how we Celestials communicate albeit while using the brain of the instrument. This type of communication is for the benefit of the soul, and it is a type of soul perception. Anyone at any time when in prayer and free of the encumbrances of life on earth is capable of these soul perceptions and yet the bombardment of thoughts, thought forms we will call them or waves, generally prevents these kinds of perceptions of the soul and even to a large extent, intuition.
    
When one is in prayer, true prayer, from the heart, from the soul, you open up a channel as you have here in what you call a lattice of light. You have opened up a portal, a doorway, a bridge to the Divine. And so, we come. It is rare for us to admonish anyone, but it is quite often encouragement, that we bring. And countless times you are encouraged to pray from your soul. To allow your mind to take a back seat along with all your cares. To be as this one says, “In the flow, in grace”. To allow the joy that comes in the blessing and sanctity of God’s love to be present.
     
I also wish to add that most mortals are unaware that there is always a possibly to communicate soul to soul. Not only with spirits, but with other mortals. For if you did not have this medium, if you did not have this internet or phone communication, you could still communicate with each other, intuitively yes, but more importantly on this path, soul to soul. And you may have noticed it is not unusual for people in this circle and in the many prayer circles to have the same thought the same feeling at the same time. So, as you are sending out in every moment, send out love. This love of God that you have send it out. Be mindful of what you receive take in the love and the light that all may be blessed. Clear the airwaves. Be in Grace.
  
I thank you. I am your brother and friend in eternity in the love of God. I am Judas of Kerioth. God bless you.
