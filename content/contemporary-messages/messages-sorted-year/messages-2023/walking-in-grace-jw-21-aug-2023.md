# Walking in Grace

August 21<sup>st</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I come, it is I, Care. I come in the love of God to this beautiful circle, to those seen and unseen. For there is great multitude in attendance drawn by your light, drawn by your prayer. 
   
I wish to speak a bit about my passing into spirit. As some may know, I predicted this event. I had dreamed of it, I had visions of it, and it chilled me to the bone because it was a rather horrific car crash which took the lives of four people. Now a lot of time has passed since that momentous occasion, and I can tell you it happened all very quickly and there was not a lot of suffering going on. I myself was in prayer at the time of the accident and as I felt the impact, I called out *“Oh my God”.* I mention this to you because during all the events occurring on the earth in these troubled times and rather dramatic earth changes that you are all very aware of, you all have considered the possibilities of ending your mortal existence. 

And you know of course, whether it is sooner or later, it is a given. When you are in a state of grace, in the love of God, lifted above the world and in rapport with the great soul of the Creator, the world has little or no weight upon you, despite all the goings on. In fact, if you could be in this love, you would be as if walking in the world awake and seeing others as if in a dream and also your soul knowing there is no death. 

This is a real knowing as the soul is transformed in the very substance of the Creator. Imagine, if you will, being in a state of love whereas passing into spirit is just a moment, and for you, my beautiful friends and loved ones, it will be a glorious moment. I stand on this truth, and I promise you, your prayers, your soul longings, your aspirations are not in vain. And as my dear sister<sup>1</sup> mentioned synchronicity, this is being in the flow of grace, where all things are in harmony, all things come together. Now there are certain laws upon the earth, and they are different than the laws of spirit, but the love of God puts your soul in a place that is above this world. 
    
You know that it is said if you smile, your body has a reaction, it creates chemicals, it heals, it blesses. If you walk this world without fear, with only love, everything will change, everything will fall into place. So with all the difficulties of being at peace in a turbulent world, and also amongst sometimes vexed spirits influencing others, when you stay in the love of God, none of that has any weight, for you are always lifted in Divine Love, and not only that, but you lift others. This, my beloved knows well, and he accepted humbly to help me on my journey as I now help him on his and we all here in the Celestial Kingdom help you all. Know this without a doubt. Be mindful of it in your day and at night. Ask and you shall receive. Knock and the door will be opened. 
  
With all my love and blessings from all of us here to all of you, I shall step back, and I thank you for this time. It has been my delight. May God bless you with a great inflowing of His love. I am Care.
