# Tribute to All Seeking Truth and Love

March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Yogananda received by Al Fike

My friends, I am Yogananda. I come to demonstrate that the Truth of God’s Love may be expressed through many different individuals who come from many parts of your world and many aspects of the world of spirit, for the truth knows no boundaries. The Truth of God’s Love is available to all. Do not think that because you have your idea and concept of truth that this is the only approach, the only way. It is indeed a powerful way and a clear road that you take. But there are others in your world who are seeking truth and seeking God and they may not use your words. They may not see things from your mindful perspective. But indeed, you and they have hearts aglow with the desire to be with God. So I urge you to embrace your brothers and sisters who are not of your ilk and culture and ideas, for this is meant to be a truth that is available to all and is carried to all corners of the world.

May you truly be that instrument of love without any inhibition or prejudice or fear, but pure love, my friends, pure love. For this is what will change the world. So you are given a great advantage and blessing. Utilise this to the best of your abilities. Express it through your highest self, your soul, and be truly one who walks in the light. In this way, many will be drawn to you and even those who do not understand your language, your words, will feel your light and that which glows all about you. This is the power of God’s Love, the great blessing of His Love. Be that blessing, express that gift in all manner and ways that God has imbued you with, those gifts that you carry, those aspects of your soul and your being expressing love, expressing truth.

May God bless you, my friends, and keep you on the Path Divine. I am Yogananda and I am privileged to speak with such wondrous souls who have come to assure you upon the path. I am humbled and I am grateful for this opportunity. God bless you, my friends. I am Yogananda and I love you. I love you dearly, brothers and sisters of souls awakening and lights aglow in truth. God bless you.
