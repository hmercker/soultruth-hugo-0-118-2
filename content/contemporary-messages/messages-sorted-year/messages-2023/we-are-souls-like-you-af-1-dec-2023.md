God bless you, my friends. I am Orion and I come to join you because you have asked for my presence and my counsel. So, I am here. I am here basking in the light that has been created in this place. I am here because each of you have a curiosity, a desire to know me, to understand me. 

I say to you, *“Am I any different from you?”* Though I live in a place that is different, indeed, God created many souls to inhabit the universe and I am but one, one of countless souls, one with that designation of having a soul, of being a part of the great family of souls that are spread out throughout the universe. You are my brothers and sisters and we are part of this family. 

Indeed you understand what I understand. That the great Source of Love from God is a boon for the soul, the great blessing that shall transform, awaken and sustain the soul for eternity. So, in the course of eternity, I am sure that you will come to know me and I will come to know you. For I have a deep curiosity about those of you upon this earthly plane and the lives that you live so different from our own. 

Yet you seek for something higher and greater and more in tune and in harmony with your Creator. We too seek this blessing. We too understand the motivation, the yearning from deep within. So, through this commonality of desire and in essence created the same, then we are compatible, we are together in this great journey of life. 

I too have a physical body and I too possess a soul and a spirit body. Today I visit you in my spirit body and soul to communicate and to pray together. For prayer is the universal expression of individual souls to God. The words that you may use, the understanding that you may have may vary, indeed, because we live a life that is different from yours. But the desire, what comes of the prayer, whether I say a prayer or you, is the same. So we share this as well, this connection, this experience of a loving God who shines His Love upon us, who comes to bless us, to uphold us, to carry us along the road of spiritual progression, of soul awakening.

I pray with you, my friends, and I hope that you will be my friend. That we may walk some distance together. For my hope is that I might uphold you, that I might share with you the wisdom of my soul to help you along your path, and that you in turn may have some love for me, some understanding of me. That this may open the door of deeper understanding of the universe and the commonalities and differences that exist. 
 
For life is varied, indeed, and the possibility of life is on many planets, many variations that God has brought and allowed to flourish in His universe. Yet, those of us with a soul have very common features. There is a harmony in expression of our beings that you would recognise and appreciate. We are not some creatures from an author’s imagination. Instead, we exist in harmony with the laws of God and this template of creation for those of us who possess a soul. 

My friends, I hope you see me as your friend and we may, indeed, come to know each other in the great journey of life. Blessings to you. I am Orion and I love you, each of you, each of you a blessing in my life and my journey. God bless you. My love is with you all. God bless you.
