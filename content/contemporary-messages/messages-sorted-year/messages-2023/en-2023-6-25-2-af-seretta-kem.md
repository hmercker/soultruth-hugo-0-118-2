Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

As you come together, you are more attuned to one another, more loving, more accepting, allowing the flow of love to embrace you all. I am Seretta Kem and I greet you and I welcome you, my beloved friends. We are very pleased with the insights and perceptions that each of you have had while you have engaged in prayer in the room. Indeed, what you have seen and understood, perceived, is merely a fraction of what has come about as you pray together. If you can imagine the different layers of spirits, angels, stellar friends who are playing their part and making their efforts so much so that you may indeed benefit from these ministrations. Indeed, this is just the beginning, the beginning of a miraculous journey towards the awakening of your soul, the awakening of your gifts, the awakening of many things. We urge you forward, beloved souls, as you continue to allow the shifts and understandings, knowings of your soul to come forward into your consciousness.

You are well aware, my beautiful friends, what is being given at this time, the opportunities that have opened to you, the love that pours upon you. So, there is little to be said but as you are receptive, as you awaken to what is being given then you will understand and there is no need for us to explain. For each in his own way will come to this understanding. Each in her own way will realise the depth and breadth, the importance and the power of God’s Touch upon you and all this entails. For we cannot act, we cannot bring to you anything that is not condoned and blessed by God and in terms of your own receptivity, it cannot be given unless you are receptive and agree that it may be given. We are merely the intermediaries to this great flow from God to you and indeed we all come into alignment with what is and what is meant to be in this venture together.

My friends, may the joy in your soul, rise up and reach God. For God is joyful as are we at what is and what can be, beyond the veil of the human mind and condition, the realms of possibilities are great. So you seek to rise above to be in that place of great light and great possibilities. Allow yourself this gift. Allow yourself to release all that that holds you from it. You are all truly blessed and loved by God and in the power of God’s Love you shall know the realisation of all that you can be and all that is meant to be as you work together as you seek to serve God, serve humanity, serve all that is of light and truth. It shall flow. It shall flow abundantly, unceasingly, a gift from God given without restriction, without limit. It is yours only limited by your capacity to receive and accept. Put aside all those conditions that you create, all those mindful ideas that percolate within you and be free, be open and be joyful. Seek the Love of God to lose the impediments, to bring the clear flow of these blessings.

I thank you, beloved souls, for all your efforts, for all you have done so far. Remember that what you have done and what has been given, what you have experienced and know, is merely a tiny fraction of what is and what can be. So it is a journey. It is an unlimited and unrestricted journey to God and all that is of God. Shall we pray together, my beloved friends, to unleash the floodgates of truth and love and light so that you may be swept away into new realities of new understanding with new perspectives that reflect the depth of love within you and around you and all that God has to give to you.

God bless you, my friends. I am Seretta Kem and my love for you is great and deep. Many surround you with love, with acknowledgement, with joy and with wonderment for how precious you are in such a difficult and dense place. You seek the light and the freedom that comes with the light and so, you are acknowledged and honoured by all that are of light. God bless you. God bless you. I love you, always.
