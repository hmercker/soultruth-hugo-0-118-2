# Invitation to Divine Love

May God bless you, beloved souls, children of God, brothers and sisters all. I am Augustine. I am a Celestial Angel who resides within the Celestial Kingdom. I come to you to assure you that the Love of God, His blessing upon you, is waiting for each who is here and all of humanity upon this planet. It waits for you. It is a gift, a gift beyond all gifts, for the blessing of the Father’s Love is more powerful than any other blessing available to humanity. It is for you to seek it. It is for you to be curious about it. It is for you to prove to yourself that this blessing exists, and you and only you can choose to receive it. No other can give this to you. It is for you to go to God, each individual, each soul, seeking its Creator. 

Can you walk in this light and feel its blessing? Can you feel the peace that passes all understanding? Can you be truly immersed in the Living Waters of God’s Love? In this, you will know bliss and joy. You will know what our beloved brother Jesus talked of, the redemption of the soul, for it is in this way that their soul is redeemed. For it is transformed by this gift. It no longer is human, but becomes divine. This path is available to every soul. It is available to you, if you so wish to take it. 

So, we come to speak to peoples upon the Earth, to tell them of this high road to greater light, to greater understanding and truth. Do you wish to put your footsteps upon that road? Or do you wish to ignore the invitation? I urge you to step forward, beloved souls. Each of you are seekers. Each of you desire truth. Each of you have a yearning soul. Answer the call, beloveds. Answer the call, where the great Love of God awaits you. It will soothe you. It will heal you. It will uplift you, and it will transform you. Blessed are the children who come to God in all innocence and desire to be with the Creator of all. For He awaits you, beloveds. He awaits you. 

May His grace be upon you all this day, His Light pouring down upon each of you, His Light not only lighting up this place, but expanding out to many places, many places. Blessed are the children, blessed are each of you in God’s Love. God bless you.

We honour each of you, precious souls of God’s creation, and those who wish our presence with them shall have it. Seek for the highest road, the deepest and most profound truth, and it shall be yours for all eternity. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you. I am Jesus and I am with you. God bless you.
