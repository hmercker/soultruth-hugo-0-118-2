I come, your brother in Christ and the spiritual grandfather of this one, I am George Gurdjieff, Papa G. May the love of God be upon you!

Some here may know of my work when on earth and others may have little or no idea. I was a teacher of spiritual truths, and I spent many years on my spiritual journey among many adepts searching for the core, the sources of religious beliefs and the very essence of spiritual life. My longings brought me into contact with many wonderful souls from every spiritual leaning but primarily my teachers were Sufis. I would like you to  to know that a Sufi, a real Sufi, is to Islam as you are to orthodox Christianity.  For you have sought the essence of the teachings of the Master as the real Sufis did and do, and as the great rabbis Hillel and Baal Shem Tov in the Judaic tradition, as Francis and many others in the Christian tradition, and as Yogananda and (Shirdi) Sai Baba and others in the Hindu tradition. All had found the essence of true religion in God’s love and the souls’ journey of transformation. 

When you examine the lives of these and other saints you always find a deep longing for at-one-ment with God and to be changed beyond whatever sect or denomination they belonged to. For the longings of soul must transcend religious dogma and this is something every true seeker learns. My dear friends, you’ve have come together in these circles; you who have been blessed to have the truth revealed to you through James Padgett and other mediums in contemporary times. This has brought you to the very precipice of the Father’s Kingdom. 

In my teachings I stressed waking up and finding hope in consciousness, hope in faith, and being aware in every moment of one’s tendencies to be distracted, to be out of harmony, and therefore suffer the consequences. So, I developed a teaching that involved prayer and dance and music and meditation.  And sometimes even the use of substances to take one out of their limited consciousness and experience what you would call the apex of human love in the oneness of all. 

When you are told to go within you need not reject this. Go within and be in that calm beautiful place and then with all the depth of your soul longings open up in the longings, in the asking for the Creators’ love, that His holy Spirit may come and bring this love into your souls. When you are in this grace remember to as Jesus admonished his disciples in the garden: *“Stay awake, stay awake with me”*. Know that this request was deeper than just not falling asleep on the surface. The requirement is to stay awake in soul that one may be in the love of God. Whatever it takes to shake off the somnambulant world and all its frills and attractions whatever it takes for you I encourage you to do. For each soul is unique and each soul has different requirements. Each soul walks its own path and yet the goal is the same; to awaken in the love of God and to be transformed. 
  
When you come into this circle your soul immediately knows: *“Ah I can let go, I can let go of the day, of the burdens, I can receive, and I can send out the blessings that I receive”,* as you have been informed and as you must know. 
   
When you send out a healing as long as its recipient is open to receive it they will. For God works in mysterious and wonderful ways beyond the imaginations fo the material mind. 
    
Stay in this blessing. Stay in this beautiful connection to eternal life and the Endless Love from God above. I thank you so very much for taking my message and I send you all my love and blessings in the Love of God. I am your brother and friend in the Celestial heavens. I am George Gurdjieff. May God bless you.
