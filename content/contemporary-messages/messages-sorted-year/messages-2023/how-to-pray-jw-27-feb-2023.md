I am here, your brother in Christ, Judas, once of Kerioth. 
   
You have been encouraged time and time again to pray and some have used the word *‘unceasingly’* which to those in the human condition certainly seems a formidable task. What does this mean? Much has been said about prayers from the heart, prayers from the longing of the soul and that is because the intention behind the words of a prayer reach God without any obstruction. Let me explain. So many prayers are mindful and full of beautiful words. The mind is a wonderful organ of discrimination, a repository of knowledge and for the seeker, the spiritual seeker, this is generally the first course of practice. To find the words, to be able to talk to God is presumed to be the task and this is often accompanied by much self-consciousness, perhaps even embarrassment. When one speaks from the heart, no matter if it is elated, no matter if it is troubled, that feeling allows God to open your soul and His holy spirit comes as an immediate response to the longing of the heart, of the soul. This brings a change and what once had begun as a response to a crisis, perhaps a tragedy, something that seemed impossible pressing upon one so that one may be crying out, *“Dear God, hear my prayer, heal my wounds, touch my heart, bring your love into my soul”*, does bring God love into your soul, and this you know. 
   
For those starting out who need inspiration to be in their heart, there is music, and of course there is the prayer that James Padgett received which covers so much and is highly recommended. But at the point where the soul begins to inform the mind rather than the inverse, which is the case in the material world, one can go without a word into the sacred place of their heart, of their soul to God’s soul, and what was once a response to crisis becomes bliss and praise and a glorious thing: The presence of God in your soul! At this point, one can in fact make their life a prayer, beyond the formal, beyond the words, allowing their souls to direct them and the soul’s perceptions to guide them. For it is when you are in your soul, we in the celestial kingdom come. We are at your call. 
   
So, as Luke has so beautifully said, bring your soul to the struggle. Bring whatever it is that is pressing upon you to God. Allow God to reach into your soul, that it may be changed, that you may be a light unto this world, as you intend to do in service, in gratitude, in the glory of God. God’s love without end, unceasing, everlasting. May it be yours. 
  
I join you now in this circle of love, in this sacred prayer, in the presence of God, and the company of so many here in the kingdom. With all my love and blessings, I am your brother and friend in Christ, once from Kerioth, now an inhabitant of the Celestial kingdom. May God bless you. I am Judas.
