Blessings come as your group grows. I am Andrew, and I come to greet you in this Circle of Light, uphold you in your efforts together to indeed strengthen the bonds together, becoming a family of light, being that example in the world of harmony, grace, acceptance, embracing one another and releasing any resistance to the differences that you share. Coming together in love, supporting one another in the awakening of your soul, seeking all that which is of God. For is this not the key, beloveds? When you seek out God, those conditions within you, those barriers that you have that restrict love and acceptance, light and joy, dissolve in love, dissolve in the gift of Godâ€™s Love. 

Each of you have been deeply blessed. Each of you have been deeply guided. So you express those blessings and guidance as you come together to share your individual perspective, your understanding, your soulful wisdom. So it comes as a flow of light, of love, together. Together, you shall all be uplifted as you seek the blessings of the Heavenly Father. Closer to heaven you shall be, my beloved friends, closer to the light, closer to all that is good and full of the grace of God. God bless you. I am Andrew and I love you, beloved souls. I love you.
