Indeed, we acknowledge the Master as he who leads us to higher realms in the Celestial Kingdom. I am John, known as John the beloved, and I come today to join you in your acknowledgement of our beloved, beloved brother and friend, teacher and healer. We do not worship the Master. Rather we acknowledge him in love and we come together with him in prayer as our most exalted and beautiful brother who inhabits the highest realms of the Celestial Kingdom and continues to open the way for us as he progresses, so we may follow. 

It is for you, beloved souls. He shall open the gates, the doors to eternal love and joy and light. In his humility and grace, he acknowledges each one of us and each one of you as you strive toward the Kingdom, as you look to be that purified and transformed soul that comes with the Father’s Love. For Jesus was the messenger and the example of the journey to be had by each soul toward at-onement with God.

His light and his being showed us the way, all of us, towards that which can be attained and is available to every soul in this world and ours. Every soul may follow this road. No matter past sins and darkness within, they may be redeemed in love. For God forgives and God blesses every soul who asks for this blessing, this great gift of the inflowing of the Father’s Love. 
We come together today, not only to acknowledge the beloved Master, but to acknowledge the truth and the way toward eternal happiness and light and soul awakening in the joys of love. How wondrous is God’s creation, beloved souls, to make possible such a journey, to awaken us to such a way of being in the universe, in our lives? Each of you are drawn to this. Your souls know and are eager to drink of the Living Waters of God’s Love. Each of you continue to make your prayers, to stretch and long for God, to be in that place of acknowledgement and bliss and love that comes with your relationship with your Creator.

We walk together, beloved souls, towards the Fountainhead of all love. We have done so because our beloved brother, Jesus, has shown us the way. That God made possible his incarnation upon the earthly plane, and in so doing, opened the door of possibilities that Jesus, our beloved brother, may teach us, may show us the way as he did all those years ago. He continues to do so to this day and shall until the doors of Heaven are closed. 

He shall show the way to all who are willing to walk the road of the transformation and redemption of the soul awakening to the Love of God, this beautiful journey which can be taken by any soul no matter their background or religion or perspective upon the world. It is the soul responding to the great Love of God, emanating from His great Soul to every soul, that makes possible this journey and this awakening. 

You are all upon that road and Jesus continues to lead you forward. And so, we shall. We shall know the wonderment and bliss of God’s Love for all eternity. Beloved souls, you have found the road and you walk upon it with diligence and urgency. We continue to walk with you as your brothers and sisters so that you may not feel alone. That you may, indeed, know that you have the upliftment and the fellowship and the love of others who are also upon this road. It is yours, given by the grace and Love of God, His great and wondrous mercy upon humanity so that many who are lost may be found in love and light. 

We ask of you to be that light, to be that example such as what our Master was so many years ago. You know the truth and you live it. Continue to walk the road, embrace your brothers and sisters and show them the way. In this, you do God’s work. In this, you do the work that Jesus began so long ago. Together we continue to make the harvest of souls toward the journey of awakening, redemption and transformation that you and we and others may continue to walk through the gates of Heaven to that promised land of great joy, bliss and love.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am John and I come to pray with you today and acknowledge our beloved brother, acknowledge the great Love of God and acknowledge each one of you as you continue upon your path toward at-onement with our Creator. God bless you, my beloved friends. God bless you in the joy of love, in the wonderment of light, and emanations of God’s Soul toward each of you. 

Open wide for the blessings, the awakenings and the transformation. You shall receive, for you have acknowledged the truth and are a part of that great brother and sisterhood of truth. We are together today in this wonderment and beauty of souls longing for the great gift from God. God bless you, beloveds. My love is with you, all of you. We shall continue to make that journey together for all eternity. God bless you. God bless you, beloveds.
