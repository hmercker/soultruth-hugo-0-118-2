# Let your crisis propel you to a life in God

There are many versions of the story of my life, and they all contain elements of the truth.<sup>1</sup> But quite often the things that are highlighted, that inspire people and light up their imaginations are in fact, less than the reality of what I experienced. For instance,  my being the patron saint of animals being pictured with birds and so forth. Yes, there is a good deal of truth in that, but it is only a small part of my story. Did you know it was not until I was captured by the Muslim army that I began to awaken to a true spiritual force, and I could hear it in every aspect of the lives of many of those I was with; the quatrains of the Sufis, the music, and the simplicity of garments were among the things that affected me, and I adopted. That was an initial turning point from a life as you humorously mentioned earlier*, a life of being somewhat of a spoiled young man. It was not until I experienced a true crisis, a crisis of my soul, a crisis of my physical body, a crisis of my mind, that I began to see the world as a giant prison and that the overlords of the world were like wardens. And so very true this was of soldiers, following orders whether for money, or country, or fame, or to act out their desires for blood lust. And so, when I had my epiphany, it came through crisis, and I could no longer live in the prison of the material world and material thoughts, the rewards of which no longer held any sway with me. 
   
And as I have said, I traded the riches of the world and the treasures that men store up for the treasures of the soul. This I could plainly see and the great freedom that it brought despite the initial reaction from my family who truly thought I had gone mad. And yet, my soul being aligned with God, gave with me in a sense an untouchability to those who would do me harm. And you may know this proved to be quite true as my brothers and I went before the elders of the church to be formally recognized for they could find no justification for turning down these poor beggars provided they could keep them within the sphere of their influence. Harmless they imagined us to be, and harmless we were. More and more came, more and more brothers to join me in the freedom of prayer, of song, of nature in our aspirations to be at one with our Creator. And then dear Claire who was inspired by us, joined with her sisters and eventually even her mother. And to this day there is much being good done by the brotherhood and sisterhood named after us. 
   
What I wish to convey is that you remember what it was that brought you to God’s love. The longings of your souls crying out: *“Dear God I need love, I need truth”.* And has your prayer been answered? Indeed, it has. More and more as you experience the freedom to live in the will of God, more and more you will be less concerned about your lives, passing over into spirit, and the troubles of this world, but rather the impetus to serve in the love of God will become paramount. Let your crisis propel you in the direction of the Celestial heavens in the love of God and in Christ I am your brother and eternal friend . I am Francis. Go in peace.
