December 14<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Circel of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

John the Baptist & Peter received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here, John the Baptist and I come close to you today, very close. This is a time when many are seeking repentance of their ways. We who know the truth encourage prayer for God’s love. A multitude has come to be with you as you pray and I say to you, my brethren, open your souls. Allow God’s love to come into your souls in a great inflowing. This will bring you more than repentance. This will bring you joy and peace and love. For it is one thing to repent. It is one thing to be forgiven. It is one thing to seek a change in your life. It is quite another to seek the Divine Love of the Father who desires to reach out to all souls and gift them with this blessing of His Essence, His love.

So I tell you, do not seek only repentance. Seek the Father’s Divine Love. Seek the truth of God and God’s creation and God’s love. Seek the truth and you shall find it. It shall be given to you. Open now. Open wide that these blessings may pour into your souls, every soul who is here and yes, I speak to many, many souls who are here, open wide, all of you. Each and every one of you is included in this. For with this love comes forgiveness. For with this love comes the miracle of rebirth, rejuvenation, transformation. This was the message that the Master brought. This is the message I did not understand until he came. I bless you all with the love in my soul which over the centuries has increased and removed anything that is not of this love. I will pray with you all now and I thank you for listening. God bless you. God bless you truly in your souls with this love. God bless you. I am John, known as the Baptist. God bless you.


I am Peter and I speak to those who walk upon the Earth and tell you that you are cherished and I look forward to when you come to live with us here in these beautiful Celestial Heavens where you will flourish and know God and become one with God in your souls and join with many others who have walked the path that you are walking. I enjoin you to pray all together as much as possible for your love grows together as well as separately. Your love manifested upon this Earth is having its effects. Continue your work and the time will come when you will join us here. May God bless you and my love is with you and I am anxious to greet you when you come. God bless you.
