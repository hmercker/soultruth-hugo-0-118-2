# Partners in Healing

One Nation Circle of Light, Fancy Gap, VA, USA

Mylora received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here. I am Mylora and my Father has sent me to be with you, to not only extend healings to each of you but also to pray with you, that His healing love heals your hearts and your souls as well as your bodies. This is a blessing that He is offering to His true children upon this Earth, a reprieve, if you will, from the heartless conditions of humanity that humanity has set forth in their lives.

God wishes to let you know that He does not abandon His children, any of them and that His love will heal you. You must open your souls, broadly. Open your souls and ask God to help you overcome those things which are vexing you and disturbing your comfort, your peace. For you have within you, Divine Love, each one of you here and you must rely on that Divine Love as a salve to your wounds, some of which are deep within you. Ask God to remove those wounds from you and allow these wounds to leave you, every part of you and know that these will leave you to the extent that you desire and allow them to come out from you. Bring them forth, now. Bring them forth out of you now. Your Father does not want you to suffer. Your Father wants you to love and these things keep you from loving.

So, dear children of God bring forth these pains of the soul through your spirit body and release them. Let them go. You have no need of them any longer. You are blessed with God’s Divine Love. Know that this love is pouring into your souls as He touches you. God bless you, dear children. There will be those souls who continue to work on you. stay open and allow this work to continue. We love you. We love you all. And there are many healers here now. God bless you. I am Mylora.
