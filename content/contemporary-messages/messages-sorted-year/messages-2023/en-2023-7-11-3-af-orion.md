Orion received by Al Fike

Feel the peace of God’s presence, my friends. I am Orion. May that peace be with you always. For it is in the stillness of God and the peace of His blessings upon you that you will find your bearings, the harmony, the purpose, the flow of your instrumentality and guidance. It is in your relationship with God that all things spiritual are made manifest and clear. It is in the light of God’s presence that you draw this peace and clarity. It is in the gift of His Love that your soul grows in wisdom and strength, perception and the capacity to love.

These things you know, my friends. You’ve experienced all these things in your spiritual journey. Yet indeed, it is important that we remind you and continue to draw your consciousness towards these truths because the cross current of human condition is strong. Unless you continue to work toward these aspects of light and truth, you are often swept away in the distractions of the human condition. God draws you back and we come to help inspire you to turn your face to God. This is how these things work together. God’s blessings upon you, one of which is our presence with you, your desires within the soul, yearning and directing your consciousness toward higher things.

All good things work toward greater light, deeper awareness, higher consciousness. So, we continue to inspire and direct. We cannot insist or tell you exactly what you must do but we can cajole and advise and help uplift so that you are not drawn away. It is important that you take this time together and do so consistently. For does this not draw you close to your Creator and to our presence? It is easy to fall out of the rhythm of these conditions, this endeavor. As you make your commitment together, as you continue to seek awakening, to seek the great gift of the Essence of God, so you remind yourselves and reinforce truth, you bring yourself to that place of the rhythms and patterns of your spiritual intention, back to God, back to the light, back to all that is important. So, we are glad to see you return again and again. It makes us very happy indeed. For you need this time, this refreshment of the soul, these rhythms and practices of prayer and contemplation, in order to sustain the light around you and to bring ever more fully the light within you.

Be close to God, my friends. It is the great truth that God desires for you to be close, that God desires for you to yearn for His presence, His Peace, His Love. All else will come as you respond to this desire and act accordingly. It comes with great blessings, great peace, great light, insight, understanding. Be with God, my beloved friends. Be in His presence. Know the peace that passes all understanding and know that you are truly in the right place, in that place of harmony and peace, joy and love. What more could you want? What is more important than this gift from God and this place of light that you share together and with others? May you continue to grow in this light, to truly understand and know the power of God’s Touch and to be at peace, always to be at peace. God bless you. I am Orion. I have great love for each of you, beloved friends of the light, of the truth. God bless you. God bless each of you.
