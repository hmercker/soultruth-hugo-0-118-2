March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2023

Gibsons, BC, Canada

Prof Salyards received by Al Fike

God bless you, I am your Professor Salyards. Windows and avenues of opportunity will come and go as you continue to reach out into the world and your community of Divine Love, all the people that are in orbit around this effort. Make sure you are aware of the opportunities that come your way and the individuals who offer their resources for the benefit of the work that you are doing because God is orchestrating things in ways that are not usually understood by mortals. Yet, we come close to you and guide you so that you may know and you may be aware of what God is bringing as a blessing and benefit to each of you and to your work.

Do not let the conditions of the world, the judgments of the world, or the intransigence of human behavior overshadow your perception and your capacity to see deeper into God's plan and capacities to guide you forward and to bring that which is required close. These things come with prayer and faith, dedication and openness, and a willingness to engage in the world in regard to God's plan and what God brings to you. It is also important to let go of your biases and your judgments, even the mental ambitions that you carry because it is God's plan that carries this forward. It is God's plan that you must know and understand. It is God's Will that is the mainstay of your actions for without knowing God's Will, you put forth another endeavor that is human formed, relying upon the mental ideas and ambitions of mortals. We are instead seeking the Divine plan and Will in this regard.

I urge you to continue to go deeper and to seek the guidance of God for without this how can we proceed? Without your clear understanding of it, how can you be unified in your efforts? Indeed, our dear son (B) has asked that each of you seek your guidance and seek to share your guidance. So, we reinforce this request so that you may come forward and ask God to guide you in the ways and means that are intended and will bring the unfolding of a beautiful plan, a beautiful endeavor that is part of God's efforts to uplift humanity. Continue to be in harmony with one another, to seek out one another, and to seek out your relationship with your Creator. And in this way, the spiritual undertone of this work will become evident and clear and come to the fore.

My God bless you in these efforts. May you come to know your role within them and be truly in harmony with God's Will, for this is where the joy will come, this is where the insights will flow, this is where the resources will open up to you and windows of opportunity will be abundant and abundantly clear.

May God bless you, beloved souls, with the inflow of His great Love which is the spark that ignites all that which I speak of. And may you continue to awaken to these things, beloved souls, truly awaken. God bless you. I am Professor Salyards, my love is with you, my heart is with you, my prayers are with you. God bless you. God bless you, my friends, evermore in the light of God's Love, evermore seeking truth, evermore seeking to serve God in the truth of His Love, in the Light of His Will. God bless you. God bless you all. My love is with you. My love is with you.
