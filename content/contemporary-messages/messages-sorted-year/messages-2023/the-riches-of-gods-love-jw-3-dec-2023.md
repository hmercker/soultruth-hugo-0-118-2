# The Riches of God’s Love

December 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

I am here, Claire. I come in the love of God to bring to this circle things that I feel may help you and for my brother here, who loves practical information and who wishes to serve. I am Claire, once from Assisi, and some of you may know I founded an order of nuns inspired by my beloved Francis and his brothers who took a vow of poverty and chose to live in nature and rely on God to provide. 

My sisters and I followed in these footsteps and even today we are known as *“The Poor Claires”.* In our order, service and prayer were paramount. We often did not speak, but would sing together, therefore what came out of our mouths would be praising God and be holy. We worked together to provide food for all, and we often fasted and I would have called this then *‘conscious suffering’* though not in any cruel way, but only to bring the soul into longing for God. 
   
I spoke to my sisters often about being transformed in the love of God and reminded them that what one loves, one becomes. I will give you examples. If one is enamored by a celebrity, this could be in the arts, this could be in sports, this could be in entertainment, that is one’s focus. People become attached to that identity, and of course, in the field of human endeavors there is much intercourse with the world. But you see where the focus lies in exalting a celebrity and in making material things predominant. It is always my honor and delight to come and speak to my kind mice, a small group that relies on God and thus it is my honor to speak to you all, both seen and unseen today.
    
I would ask you: *"What is the price of pure water? What is the price of a bountiful earth? What is the price of a clear sky or a pure wind?"* These things that sustain life are priceless in the material earth realm. In the spiritual realm, there is the living waters, the celestial skies, the wind of the spirit, and the foundation of truth to walk upon. For your souls, I ask you to remember these are priceless and to remind you that when the waters that you drink are polluted, they can cause great harm. And so it is with the environment on earth in general. The waters that you have drunk of God’s Love, do not allow them to be polluted with hatred. Call on God when anger erupts, when you feel unloved, when you are troubled, when you are ill, or out of harmony. This we ask and these things, you know, for your souls are lighted. 
    
I wish to tell you that whenever you serve another, you are rewarded. For, you know how it feels to give a gift, especially one that is dear to you. It is easy to give things that you may have that you are not attached to, but to give something that’s precious to you, that brings about a great warmth, a great appreciation, and gratitude on both sides for the recipient and for the giver. Giving the gift of the truths of and in God’s love costs you nothing but a little time with  an uplifting word or a song that touches the heart, that thrills the soul. And though you cannot place the love of God in another’s soul, you can surely touch another with the love of God that resides in your souls. Isn’t that wonderful? 
     
Finally, may I say to you this?  You don’t have to live in material poverty but recognize the poverty of spirit that exists on the earth. Take your riches, in God’s Love and share with all. For those things that are on the periphery of your path, need not be given precedence over the longings of your souls. Those things that are harmful and I would say deleterious to your physical being, to your mental state, and most importantly, to your spiritual life, shun them if you can. Let us all walk in the Love of God, together as one, transformed and on this path, that leads to the Celestial kingdom where you will join me and so many others who love you deeply, who honor you, who support you. 
    
I thank my brother for taking this message and every soul here, both on earth and in spirit for joining us today in the celebration and in the receiving of the great gift of God’s love. How I love you and how God loves you, only heaven knows. Go in peace and may God bless you. 
   
I am Claire, once of Assisi, now an inhabitant of the Celestial kingdom and a follower of the Master.
