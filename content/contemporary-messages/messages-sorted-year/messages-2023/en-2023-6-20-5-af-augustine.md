# With Joyful Anticipation of Direct Voice Retreat

June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Direct Voice, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Augustine received by Al Fike

From the joy within your hearts, my beloved friends, the anticipation of coming together in a few days hence, I am your teacher, Augustine. I come to encourage you greatly in your preparations and attitudes, thoughts and efforts. For it is important that when you walk through the threshold of this place, that you have put aside all conditions, concerns, material things that are not in harmony with love, with the great blessing of God’s Touch that is coming, has come and shall come upon you.

For is this not your mission, my beloved students, to walk in the truth and light of God’s Love, to be fully dedicated to this journey and process that is God’s blessing upon your soul? That nothing may stand in the way between you and your Heavenly Father, that a channel may be so clear, so wide, so great, so deep that you will always feel connected to your Creator and that the flow of His Love shall always be your blessing. Yes, so simple, my beloved friends and yet, you are challenged daily. Yet there are still things within you that impede this simple process, this opening to God.

Of course you are not the only ones who have inhabited this Earth and had these challenges. I, for one, had many when I was on the Earthly plane and there have been few who have lived on this plane who have not been challenged. Realistically, it is only those souls who have spent just a brief moment in the physical body as a fetus or child who come relatively unscathed into the spirit world. Yet, we are asking you to withdraw from the darkness and revert back to that innocence that was your soul before incarnating. Not only this, but the empowerment of your soul with God’s great Love which, at this very moment, is changing you and transforming you, developing all of those gifts and capacities of the soul. In fact there are many aspects and elements that are coming into alignment within you and around you. Do you not feel God’s handiwork in play around and within you, changing, upholding, healing and bringing greater peace and joy?

And so as we come together very shortly, there will be more evidence that you will feel, know and see that will prove my point that you are indeed coming into greater alignment with God and the Will of God. It will be an extraordinary time, my beloved and beautiful students. It will be a time of rejoicing, a time of awakening, a time of great peace and great joy. Come together in harmony. Leave your doubts and fears behind. Walk into  light, opening yourself up fully to the light and seek greater alignment, greater love, greater development, greater awakening as you pray together. This gift from God that is being given will provide for you great inroads into your soul’s awakening and the gifts therein, coming to the fore, provided you come in great faith and desire and set aside all conditions that are not in harmony with this purpose. Because when you come together, you have set aside your daily life. In doing this, you set aside all those patterns, thoughts, beliefs and conditions that reflect your engagement with the material world.

Rather, free yourself from these conditions. Allow the flow and light of God’s Love to truly guide you and engage you. Be innocent.  Be pure in your intentions. Do not seek to fulfill your own personal needs. Rather seek to fulfill the needs of this gathering, of what is required, what you can give, how you may be. This is not a time for personal gratification. Rather, it is a time for attunement, awakening and giving as a channel of love in whatever way you might do this, beloved souls. Engage in these practices. Engage in those guided impressions that will show you what you might do together, how you might be together. Be the highest self that you can be, within your mind, within your soul, within your spirit, the highest expression of all of these things. We will endeavor to clear out all of those parts of you, expressions of you, elements within you that are not in harmony with this work.

We will be diligent indeed and many spirits, angels, stellar friends will be engaged with you at this time. This home will be filled with beings of light, those who have come to help, have come to uplift, have come to educate and guide. For when you make the choice, my beloved friends, to spend this time together to truly dedicate yourselves, and put aside all those expectations, conditions that reflect the earthly life and be in this place of light together, unimpeded, unconcerned, free from all those conditions that may draw you away. Discipline your mind so that these things may not come to the fore of your consciousness. Pray as often as you might, beloved friends. Be with God. Be with God together. Be with God for each other. Let all other things dissolve in the light that God is bringing into your midst.

God bless you beloved students, seekers of light and truth. May God bless you deeply, keep you close, protecting you always and showing you the way, that road of light that is set before you. I am your teacher, Augustine and my love is great for each of you. I shall indeed attend this coming together, this gathering, so purposeful. May God bless you, beloved souls. May God indeed bless you greatly.
