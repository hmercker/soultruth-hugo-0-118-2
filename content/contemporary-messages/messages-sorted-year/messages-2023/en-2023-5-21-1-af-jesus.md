# The Destiny of Our Souls

May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Jesus received by Al Fike

I come. I am with you, beloved souls, your brother, your friend Jesus. I come. I come to pray with you and uplift you. I come to be that light that you may gaze upon and know that the power of God’s Love is immense and shall transform each one of you in the glory and wonderment of God’s Touch upon your soul. I come to affirm this truth and to urge you upon the path.

For this is the way and the light. This is the key to opening the door to the Celestial Kingdom. This is the destiny of your soul that yearns and longs to find at-onement the God. Pray for this gift as often as you might. Pray for this blessing that will bring all blessings, that will awaken you to all things of God. For it is in this blessing that you are redeemed, that you may find your relationship with your Creator in such a way that it is unbreakable, unalterable. It will be forever and shall grow forever.

Your relationship with God will be the touchstone to all that you are and all that you do. For this relationship brings all guidance and upliftment and healing. It brings Love Divine that shall be your awakening. It shall bring the understanding of truth in such a way that none other and no other way can bring this. It is the highest path, the greatest gift, the most beautiful transformation of your soul, bringing purity and light, truth and enlightenment. It is for you to make your steps upon this path, to walk eagerly, to pray earnestly, to seek with such desire, and that with your blessings that come, there will be clarity and joy and light. For the Love of God brings all these things and more.

The journey will be never-ending. Your awakening shall never cease. You shall come to know all things and come to know beyond all things that are possible with the mind. You will know God’s universe, such depth and breadth that is beyond your present comprehension. You will find wisdom that will always and evermore bring harmony to your being and to all that is about you. With this wisdom, God will bring His guidance to help you express the truth and be an example of the truth of His Love.

All these things come with a simple but earnest prayer to receive this gift. Its simplicity eludes so many. Yet, in all things of God, with soul understanding, there comes a realisation of how truly simple is truth, how powerful is the simplicity of knowledge and understanding, though it is reflected in many ways, and though it is seen through the eyes of the soul which has many capacities to understand. Thus, God gives you the gift of true understanding, of true perception as the soul is awakened, as you are awakened and that you become consciously aware of all things of God.

So we come to you, we pray with you, we are with you constantly so that your soul may find its way beyond all the pitfalls and difficulties of an Earthly life. We uphold you and protect you and most of all, we bring our love to you so that you may feel the upliftment, so that you may taste the elixir of God’s Love more readily, so that you may realise what it is that you are seeking.

God provides many things to you, beloved souls, because God’s Love for you is immense and beyond measure. Each of you is cherished as much as a whole universe, for God’s Love reflects this. The power of His Love is as great for you as all His Creation. The power of God’s Love gives a special gift, that of the transformation of your being, so that one day you may walk with Divine grace and blessings.

My beloveds, yes, to understand the immensity of the Love for you is difficult at this time in your life, but know in times to come, as you grow in the Father’s Love, you will gain insight and understanding so profound that you will weep with joy and know the power of His Blessing upon you. It is available to you at this moment and at all moments in your life. Avail yourselves of the gift of His Touch upon your soul and in this way, you become a true child of God. In this way, you become my true brother and sister in this world and thus, you are precious to me, beloveds, precious beyond price, precious beyond understanding. My love for you is great and shall continue to enfold you as one of my brothers and sisters upon the great journey towards God.

I love you. I love you so dearly and I am with you. I have great compassion for your struggles. I have great desire for you to be uplifted from these struggles. In your prayers and desires, so you draw me close, and so you will know the touch of healing and grace that I may give to each one of you. Beloveds, beloveds, may we come together now in the glorious Touch of God’s Love and be His children Divine upon the endless journey of at-onement.

God bless you. I love you and shall always be with you, my beloveds. God is always with us all. God bless you. May you know the peace that passes all understanding. May you feel the light and warmth of the Holy Spirit touching your soul. May you know the joy of your soul’s recognition of God. May we all know the oneness, the oneness of our relationship to the Divine. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you. God bless you. God bless you.
