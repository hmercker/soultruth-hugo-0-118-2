# Gratitude in Body and Soul

June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

I am here, your brother in Christ, a disciple of the master and a redeemed child of the Father. I am Judas. There has been much said about the necessity for prayer. True prayer from the heart, from the soul, produces true results. These results stem from the great inflowing of God’s love in response to every sincere request, every deep longing, every truly earnest aspiration. This produces an inevitable result of the opening of the soul and the inflowing of the Father’s essence bringing about a state of Grace, as in this circle. 
    
Do you know, in the celestial realm, we send up prayers of gratitude for prayers not yet answered in the knowing they will be, and this gratitude extends above and beyond the earth plane? For gratitude produces a physical response that results in what is sometimes referred to as the *‘hormone of happiness’*, which would be oxytocin. This hormone is also felt by mothers breastfeeding children and meditators, and it brings about a calm, the very essence of peace and joy, which is felt in the body. This is the physical response to gratitude. When one prays from the soul with gratitude, it not only produces this physical reaction that I mention, but also a spiritual reaction that arises above the material realm and into Spirit in the connection with God’s Divine Love. As I have spoken about, and others, this puts one on the celestial bridge where your soul walks between heaven and earth. 
    
When one experiences what are called tears of joy, this is a human response in gratitude. But also know that tears of grief stem also from gratitude, from a deep love. Often emanating from losing a dear one or something that one had a loving connection with and though that feeling of loss can be deep and long, it leads to ultimately realizing how grateful you are to have known a person or even a place, and this gratitude ultimately produces a physical response. That physical response to what began in grief or in tragedy and now can be seen as a lesson learned, as a deep love, never to be lost truly, though perhaps separated momentarily from the physical realm. 
     
So, my dear brothers and sisters, when you awaken in joy, when you are grateful for every gift, every breath, every protection, every guidance, you bring this gift that you have received and are grateful for. You bring this to the world. This is an aspect of the Father’s love. Grateful we are to know of it, to pray for it, to receive it, and to be transformed in it. May God bless all in this circle for you see He has blessed me; therefore all things are possible in God’s love. I step back in faith, in gratitude, in joy, your brother in Christ, your eternal friend. I am Judas, once of Kerioth, now inhabitant of the celestial heavens, and I love you.
