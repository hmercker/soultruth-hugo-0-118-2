It is I, your brother Judas, once of Kerioth, now an inhabitant of the Celestial Kingdom, a disciple of the master, and your brother in Christ. May this time upon you all on Earth be a coming together, not only in the communion of God’s Love, which is of the utmost importance, but also as a community, that the Earth, in all its changes, will have the foundations of divine truth firmly planted, sustained over time.

All fear is, at its root, a fear of death. You have all experienced perhaps a thousand deaths, large and small in your lives and you know you have survived every one of them and you will survive the death of your physical body into a life anew in realms of light. And yet, fear persists. Self-preservation, although a gift, needs to be transcended in the knowing of life beyond. This knowing is a hope realized when prayer brings the Father’s Love into your souls and there comes to each of you, faith in the knowing in your soul of eternity. Hard to fathom with the mind as it is, but a soul graced in God’s Love awakens to the perception not only of eternal love, but of eternal life.
 
This connection you have with us in the celestial kingdom is but an example of the bridge between mortality and immortality. Easy to say *“fear not”* but challenging to walk out in faith. Take heart, truly take heart, for God’s embrace and the protection of the celestial kingdom is yours. We shall not only support the transformation of your souls but wish you to know that the kingdom will provide, and it is our great desire to see places of refuge, sanctuaries, where all may come in prayer, be established. So, walking into your future, have hope, take heart, pray for the love of God that you may have faith unshakeable, in the knowing of the reality of God’s kingdom and His great love. I thank you. I am your brother and friend, always. I am Judas. Go with God.
