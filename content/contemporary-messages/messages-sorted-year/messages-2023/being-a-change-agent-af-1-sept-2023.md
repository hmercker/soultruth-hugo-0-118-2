May the Great White Spirit bring His blessings to your soul. Beloved friends, I am White Feather and I come to speak to you about purity and intention. For what good is it if you drink pure waters and breathe pure air if within yourself, you are not pure, within yourself, there is much judgement and fear and projection of dark thoughts upon this world of yours. My beloved friends, first and foremost, you must be pure in your heart, that you must carry within you the intention, the desire to be in the light. For when a soul is in alignment with God, then that alignment comes a great blessing of the purity of God’s Soul, which you call Divine Love, then you are upon the road to purify yourself, to be changed by the great change agent of God.

If each and every soul upon your Earth took this journey, this road to purity and transformation, there would be no need to pray for the Earth, its healing and reconciliation with the laws of God. For each of you will conduct yourselves in such a way that there is harmony and purity in your lives, your thoughts, your actions. It starts with each individual. It starts with your desire and the implementations of your desire in your life. Those of you who can put aside all that which is impure, all that which creates disharmony and darkness will become the agents of change, the catalysts for the great change that is coming to your world. I know each of you prays for this. You desire this. But do you truly understand what that first step is, to feel, know and be that light that you are meant to be? Beautiful children of the Earth, to experience the Earth in its simplicity and beauty and all that is of God. To be a part of the Earth in this way as well, is important. To not absorb and embrace all those things that are made by men who are hard of heart and lack focus, discipline and perception toward that which is in harmony with God.

You must be the ones with great focus, discipline and desire to walk in the world with God by your side, with God in your heart, with God guiding you forward. These things are not impossible. It’s just that so many of you have blinded yourself from all that is possible and all that is of God. Not intentionally, my friends, not because you dislike all of these things that are of God and are of light. It is because the powerful currents of your world influence you greatly and bring you away from these things. It is easier to comply, to be a part of the human condition and endeavours than it is to be  apart and different from these things.

Those who are strong enough, those who can apply themselves with great intent and strength will be the forerunners of what humanity is meant to be and will become. It is a choice with each moment, each breath, each thought, each action. I want you, my beloved brothers and sisters, to think about what you say and do, to think about your actions and your attitudes, to think about what God wishes for you to do and to go within yourself to find the answers, to find the way, to walk the path. For it is important to do so at this time. For your beloved world is in great distress. You see it daily. Many feel the outcomes of a world out of harmony and many suffer from this. Do you wish for the suffering to go on? Do you wish for yourself to suffer? It takes foresight and wisdom to understand the path that must be taken. 

So you must go to God. You must seek that gift of His Love. Seek the light that comes with His love. Seek the wisdom that will emerge as His Love infills your soul. In this way, you become a new person, a person readily able to walk in the world in light and harmony, in peace and in alignment with the laws and Will of God. These things have been said to you over and over again. Each of us brings our own individual perspective of what the common message is. I say to you, we keep speaking, sharing and guiding because often you listen and yet you do not act. You hear us but yet you do not understand. 

Your understanding comes with the unfortunate consequences of your actions. When you walk in the world and suffer, then you understand the consequences, yet, often understanding comes too late to avoid the suffering. This is the way of your world, a way that is obsolete, unnecessary, and undesirable. Do not act and jump into that which is dark and then ask for forgiveness from God. Though God will always forgive you, God cannot circumvent the consequences of your actions as you suffer. Our intention is to help you to avoid suffering, to avoid disharmony, to avoid darkness. 

We come to you over and over again to help uplift and to guide, to help teach and to heal, to help open your awareness that you may make those choices that are in harmony with light and God’s laws. So we speak and so, we are with you. We do so in love. We do not judge. For we are far beyond that. But indeed we see with concern, at times with sorrow, your choices and to see what will come of them and how indeed, you will suffer. We urge you to look, to understand, not only your own circumstance, but to see the circumstances of humanity upon this earthly plane and how the world suffers through so much that is avoidable, that can be corrected but is not.

Think of how you may correct your life, and how you may avoid further suffering. Think of how you may be useful to God as a light, as a leader, as an example for the truth and for that which is harmonious. In this way, you will gain strength and insight, joy, beauty, light around you and within you. Be with God, my friends. It is a simple thing and yet, so hard to accomplish in your world in such a way that purity comes and you’re in harmony with all things of God’s creation. 

God bless you, my friends. I am White Feather. My love is with you and yes, I am with you all often as are many of the First Nations of this place. We, too, work with diligence and concern for you and for your world. We are close in our love, respect and joy. God bless you. God bless you, beloved friends. My love is with you. God bless you.
