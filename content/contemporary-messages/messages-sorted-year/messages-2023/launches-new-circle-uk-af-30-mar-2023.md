I come to pray with you, beloveds. I am Jesus, your brother and friend. I come because you’ve drawn me close with your prayers and longings of the soul. I come because I love you and no matter where you are upon this world, know that I may come to you as you proclaim the truth in your prayers and longings of the soul. We are truly bonded in love and no matter the beliefs and thoughts of the individual upon this earthly plane which is diverse and filled with many unique ideas and beautiful souls, with that pure longing of the soul, I come and pray with you. And so I shall, wherever you are upon the Earth, I shall be with you and God’s blessings surely flow readily, powerfully upon you. And in this, we are united, brothers and sisters united in the light of God’s love. In this, we carry the truth. We embrace it. It shines within our bosom, a bright light, glorious, proclaiming that we are loved and shall be for all eternity. 

This is the gift from God that cannot be lost and must be known in the world. This simple gift, let it shine forth through all of you my friends. Let it be your grace, your strength, your truth, your walk, that you are in the light fully, your feet firmly upon the Divine Path and a channel for God’s love and blessings for many. Put aside your reticence, your doubts and your fears, and walk with me, beloveds. Walk in the light of God’s truth and love and we shall proclaim this truth in the countenance of our light, in the loving deeds that God will guide us to, and all ways in which we may serve and express love, true and glorious love. 

May God bless you beloved souls. I am Jesus and I come. I come with love. I come with gratitude for your efforts, for your circles of light and for all that you do to further the kingdom of God. So I join you and shall do so evermore in these circles of light. God bless you. My love is with you all. God bless you.
