Seretta Kem received by Al Fike

My beloved friends, I am Seretta Kem.  So now that you have made your decisions and commitments, we will begin with our commitment to help develop you further in your spiritual and psychic gifts. The development of your soul is an ongoing process that you are well aware of and well engaged within, and if it were not for this development, your commitment to God in this way, then we could not proceed further.

But indeed, you have continued to grow within your soul. You continue to awaken the faculties of your souls through the gift of God’s Love and this has marked a turning point in your progress and in your awakening.  As you come together, you will come to know and realize how far you have come in your development. We have great appreciation for the efforts you have made and to some degree the sacrifices as well to come together in this way. Human contact, flesh to flesh, in one room is an important element when we are developing what might be considered material gifts. For the gift of Direct Voice as you call it, is meant to be a material manifestation, a reflection of we in the spirit world, in the Celestial Kingdom, who are willing to be a part of this process, who will come to accentuate the message that you bring and will give in the future.

A great deal of preparation is required. So we continue in this process together and as you prepare yourselves for this coming time of prayer and togetherness, keep in mind one another in love, a sense of connection. Those bonds that have been created in the past and continue to be created must be strengthened. It is a very important factor in the work that we do, that there are no situations or conditions developing within your mind and your emotions that inhibit the flow of love between you all. If there are such conditions, I urge you to bring these situations and thoughts to God and for God to help you to release them. For we see nothing present that is an inhibiting factor, although you are all human and indeed, there are certain human foibles and behaviors that are not in harmony with the laws of love.

We do not judge you for this, beloveds, rather we see that there are limitations. But as you continue to progress, you will release those limitations and you will see for yourself those patterns that inhibit the flow of love. It is important for you to recognize these things and ask for a fresh inflowing of God’s Love to wash them away and to be disciplined within your thoughts, allowing all thoughts to be that of love and appreciation and recognition of each unique soul in your circle. The more harmony that can be created, the more joy that is amongst you and the less ruminating about details, the better it will be to be in harmony together. Simplicity is key.

Yes, you each perceive one another in your own way through the filtering of your minds and the biases that come with this. But we are indeed, engaged in a great effort to develop your soul and all its potentials and possibilities. These perceptions are different from that of the mind. The emotions, the visions, the deductions and perceptions that come with the soul are what we wish to enhance and to encourage, and for you to dampen down those conditions of mind that race forward, that create somewhat calamitous conditions and situations which need healing and harmony.

So I urge you in the weeks to come to consider how you create these conditions within your mind and how you may correct and heal them with love. This is your assignment my beloved, beautiful souls of truth and love, to be aware of that which inhibits you from love, to nurture within you feelings of love for one another. Strengthen these bonds, putting aside any thoughts that are not conducive to love. These thoughts and judgments and conditions are part of an old and tired aspect of yourself, these human conditions that you carry that are in need of release. Your soul has moved beyond these things but indeed, your mind continues to carry and to grasp onto such thoughts and feelings.

We are asking something extraordinary from you, beloved souls, to be pure in your thoughts and deeds, to be a light in the world. For, how else can you bring this truth forward in a form and way that will be powerful and will reach many souls? If you continue to live in this duality of conditions, the light of your soul and the inclinations of your mind, then you will at some point be stuck within this and not be able to move beyond it. You are at a turning point, a crossroads where you must truly look and truly understand the workings of your mind and the inhibitions of your being that are a result of many interactions and interplays within your life.

It is not so difficult, beloved friends, to release these things, for you have within you a great core of love that is burning bright and continues to grow. Draw upon this strength, look within and feel the strength of this love burning within you. Release your fears, release all that which is creating within you a sense of aloneness, a sense that you must gird yourself against the conditions of the world, a sense that you are unloved, and a sense of not loving others. These are the challenges that are put before you. The more pure you are, cleansed of these human conditions, the greater the opportunity and chances of success of our ventures together.

We bring you together as a way of affirming this light within you, developing further faculties and abilities, bringing you closer together, bringing us closer to you and bringing you closer to God. It is not so complicated but indeed, the factors that cause complications are those conditions within you that are not yet healed and are in need of healing. Seek to be a light, seek to be released of all conditions, thoughts, judgments that are not of love. If you are successful, if you have managed to not allow your mind and those conditions of the mind of which I speak to control you and are a reflection of you that is not of light, then we are well on our way to be free from the human condition and awakened by the Touch of God within your soul.

May God bless you beloved souls, upon a journey of awakening, of growing love within, of light radiating from you, beloveds, uninhibited, free and glorious. God bless you. I am Seretta Kem and we will be working closely with each one of you, helping to inspire, to have insight, to realize your true nature and your true self. God bless you, beloveds. I am Seretta Kem and I love you. God bless you.
