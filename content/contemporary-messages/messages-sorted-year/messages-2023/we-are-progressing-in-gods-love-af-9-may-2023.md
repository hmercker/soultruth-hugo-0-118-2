God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Orion. You continue to lift your feet to move forward, although often those feet are covered with leaden material and so you struggle. You find it difficult to rise above the human condition to be those beautiful pure souls of thought and light and doing as in harmony with God’s Will and God’s laws of love. Indeed, your intention, your desire is to rise above and with this you draw to you, your angel friends, stellar friends, those beings of light that gather around you to uphold you. How blessed you are and how difficult it would be without this support that is given, without God’s hand upon you, without the power of His Essence empowering you from within. As you grow within your soul, as the power of Divine Essence expands within you, so the struggle becomes less. The impetus becomes greater and all that you perceive and desire will be transformed and expanded by this gift.

 This is the process which we have spoken of and many have spoken of, the process of transformation, the flow of awakening and the capacity to love and not to judge but to love unconditionally. It grows within you although the increments make for a slow journey and thus, you are not always aware of the progress you make. But I tell you, my beloved friends, since we have been working with you in such an overt way, we have seen much progress. We have seen shifts within you that indicate the release of the human condition and those conditions that are entrapped within your being, that are not of light or love, falling away, falling away, dissolving with the power of Divine Love. This is a time where you must have great faith, faith in this process, faith in the awakening of your soul, faith in the work that we do together. For nothing is so obvious that it becomes as tangible as your earthly existence. Rather you get glimpses and feelings and sensations that indicate that something is changing, that you are moving forward, that indeed, your leaded feet are getting less weighted and your movement less difficult.

 My beloved friends, as you continue to dedicate yourselves to prayer, to self-awareness, to fostering change within you by disciplining your thoughts and pre-empting those old patterns that bring you to a place of grayness, rather than light. While all about you conditions continue to worsen. Your family and friends continue to exhibit all the behavior and conditions that are of the human reality and yet, you continue to persist. You continue to forge ahead, and you continue to lessen your worries and cares, the burdens of judgements that may come forth. This is an indication of your progress. This is why we endeavor together and do so diligently. Because without the effort, without the prayers, without the desire, without the love that you exhibit and express in the world, what is the purpose of our efforts? 

Indeed, you make the truth tangible. Though it is subtle in many ways, still your efforts exhibit a reflection of truth, of light and love and these expressions continue to grow and strengthen and become more tangible. This gives us hope. This spurs us on though we see in a greater depth, your struggle and your triumphs and we can see through our perceptions the directions where each of you is going. And thus, we are gifted with an understanding and an enthusiasm that reflects these perceptions. 

Beloved and beautiful friends, lights in the world, you are part of the transformation of this world. You will continue to be an integral part and in times to come. Within, you will find the rewards of true perception and understanding and expression of your souls in the process of transformation. When the seed spreads within the ground, you are not aware until it sprouts to the surface and thus for you, it is just edging its way to consciousness, this great awakening that is coming and you will feel the change. You will recognize the power of it to influence and be decisive in your thoughts and actions. Your capacity to love will grow and expand.There will be joy, joy that will well up unexpectedly. These beautiful waves of light and joy that will emanate from your souls and come to your consciousness. Some of you are already experiencing this. All of you will in good time. The joy of life, the joy of love, the joy of knowing that you are loved and that God is love and that His creation is all around you expressing His love, His beautiful soul. 

These tender shoots of awareness will continue to rise up and infiltrate your consciousness to such a degree that the old perceptions and ways of seeing the world and your presence within it will be changed irrevocably so that you will truly be that expression of light that you were meant to be, that beautiful light that you are. May you continue to grow in this awareness, these feelings, these thoughts, these expressions, truly affirming the power of God’s Touch upon you, truly being that beautiful soul that you are meant to be and express in the world. Together you will affirm for one another, witness this growth, this flowering that is just on the surface and shall continue to rise up and be seen, not only by you but by your loved ones, by all you meet, by your beautiful friends within this circle of light. 

We are excited for you, beloved souls. We see what’s coming. We know that indeed, the transformation is well on its way and you will truly be a demonstration, a witnessing of this wondrous truth. God bless you, my beloved friends. I am Orion. My love for you is great. I honor you. I see you and I am your friend. Blessings to you, beloved souls, of the Universe, of God’s creation, of all that is of light. God bless you. My love for you is great. God bless you.
