# Garments Are Being Woven for Each of Us

November 10<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Josephus received by Al Fike

… you, my friends. I am Josephus. God is making for each of you a different garment. One that is not woven of material threads and means, but one of the spiritual. As you gather together in this way, each of you are contributing the spiritual means and ways of creating these new garments that you may wear and be a light in the world. Each thread is carefully selected and each thread represents your uniqueness, your beauty and your light.

As God continues with the warping and the weaving of these threads as you pray together, as you are connected together by these beautiful threads of light that are the expression of your souls and your desires and your prayers and God’s blessings upon them, this garment takes shape. It is strengthened and lightened and beautified by your prayers, by your beings as your souls grow in the great gift of the Father’s Love. This garment reflects the power of this gift and the beauty of this gift.

Each of you shall have your garments. Each of you will wear this light, this creation of light. It shall be beautiful, reflecting the beauty of your soul, reflecting your purpose, your personality, all that God has created within you. These garments indicate to all spirits, all angels and others, who you are and what you stand for. Garments of light, beloved souls. Garments of colors, hues sparkling and glowing.

No matter how dark the conditions are of the earthly plane, these garments glow and are beautiful. These garments bring you protection. These garments help you to be with God. These garments enfold you in love. They are given to you and all those who seek the great gift of the Father’s Love. We help to bring together these threads. We help God in this weaving process. We help God to put together all the many components of these beautiful, beautiful garments of light. We work together, beloved souls.

We shall all wear our garments. We shall all be of light. We shall all express the uniqueness and beauty of our beloved souls. God will touch these things with a hand of light, with a hand that brings greater life and vitality to what has been given. These gifts are given in love. These gifts sparkle and shine in all that is of God’s creation that you may embrace these things. That they may enwrap you and heal you and uplift you. That you may come to know us, we who wear our garments, we whose souls are redeemed by the great Love of God.

Together we walk upon this Divine Path. Together we seek greater light, the expression of the beauty of all that God gives to us. That we may serve God, serve humanity in loving expression and beautiful ways, simple ways, glorious ways. The blessing of God upon us all, His cloak enveloping us. We in turn feel the warmth, the depth, and the breath of His Love.

Open yourselves, beloved souls. Open yourselves to what God has to give to you. Awaken. Awaken to the glories of your soul in alignment with God, the beauty of your soul awakened by the touch of God’s Love. Thus, the perceptions, the capacities and abilities, the gifts of your soul, shall come alive and be known.

My beloved friends, may you be blessed. I am Josephus. My love is with you all. I see your lights, each one a light, each one beautiful and unique. Each one displaying their beautiful garment, the gift from God given freely, the reward of great efforts toward light, releasing the conditions that are not of light. You sparkle, resplendent in light, my beloved friends. You are blessed accordingly. God bless you. I am Josephus and I love you. God bless you, beloved friends.
