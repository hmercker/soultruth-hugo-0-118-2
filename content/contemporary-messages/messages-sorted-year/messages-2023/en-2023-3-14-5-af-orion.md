God bless you, my friends. I am Orion. As you pray, it carries you to many places, both within you and your consciousness and within the world and its consciousness. Even as you sit together in this Circle of Light, you are being utilized in many places in the world as a channel of light and love to uplift humanity. This is part of your work. This is part of our efforts together for it is not this one isolated island of light that is involved in the great and far-reaching plan of God for the salvation and upliftment of humanity. Rather, it is in every place, every nook and cranny of your world that God is working to uplift and bring truth and light into the hearts and souls of humanity.

Indeed, to lift humanity up in such a way as to make a great change in your world requires great, great effort, more than you can imagine. In order to establish the uplifting and neutralizing of the human condition, the influence and working of angels and bright spirits and we from other planets must work together. We are using our efforts and blessings and capacities for light together. We add our strength, our power to uplift, to bring humanity to a place that is different from that which has been established, from that place so mundane and lacking in understanding and love and light to a place that is enlightened in all respects.

You are part of this. You add your efforts toward it. Thus, you are being utilized in uplifting humanity. Remember this, my beloved friends, that your efforts are multi-dimensional, that your work is far-reaching, and that your time together is not just for yourselves and your development and awakening, although this is a part of this time. It is a dedication toward the upliftment of humanity. Though you focus on one gift, that which you call Direct Voice, in fact, what we are engaged within is the development of many gifts and many possibilities to serve, uplift, and bring light and truth to humanity.

You are a part of this. As you seek the greater inflowing of that universal Essence, the Essence of God the Creator, then you are strengthening yourselves and adding to the capacity to uplift the world. This is important. It is a necessary aspect and endeavour that we must engage within at this time. Indeed, the more that you engage in this effort, the stronger you become. The more you pray and are in alignment with God, the stronger you become. The more you set your sights upon higher spiritual goals and desires, you become stronger and more engaged in the work. It is not just these moments together that are important. It is every moment of your life that is important at this time, to be a part of the great upliftment, transformation, and healing so that your brothers and sisters, all of you, may step forward into a new age of enlightenment, of light and joy. That your progeny, your children and their children and so forth will benefit from these efforts, this time you have spent and others have spent in helping to uplift humanity. It is a great effort. It is one, as I say, that is engaging many, many beings to help bring enlightenment, truth, and light, soothing the troubled hearts of humanity and in this, opening the door to greater wisdom, truth, and love.

It comes with each effort. However small, however humble it might be, you add to the great forces that are being engaged at this time to bring light and healing to the world. Be true to your purpose, my friends, for each of you has a set of gifts and abilities that are crucial to the work at hand. Do not negate yourself. Do not see yourself as some insignificant creature in a great world that is vast and complicated and difficult to confront in order to bring change for this is not true. You are a part of many, many others. You have a saying that many hands might light work. Indeed, your hand combined with others makes for a formidable force in the world. This is how we work. This is how God works. Together in unity and harmony, we will indeed accomplish our goal for it has been divinely ordained and guided and Godâ€™s blessings flow upon all our efforts and on the great effort to uplift humanity.

God bless you, my beloved and beautiful friends. I am Orion and I too lend my hand to the great work ahead and what is now. God bless you, beloved friends. God bless you.
