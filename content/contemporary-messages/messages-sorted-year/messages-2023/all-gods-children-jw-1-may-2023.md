# All God’s children

May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  

Hello my friends. Hello dear Julia. I come to honor all the children of the world and all of God’s children on this joyous occasion. All on earth have a birthday where their soul and their spirit body enters the physical realm to experience the trials and tribulations, and all the triumphs, of human existence. And on earth, there is always the material question, or as I like to say, the two sides of a coin. For in the material world, there is on the one side, so much emphasis on acquiring, with the other side of it being giving and sharing.  And so, it is said, to those who have received much, much is demanded, much is requested. To live on faith is the true currency of spiritual life. Whether you are rich or poor or somewhere in between in the material world, the knowing that God provides, the trusting in God while giving freely to all, these are the great virtues that allow one to progress and they are of utmost importance in the many mansions in the Father’s kingdom on the Celestial pathway. 

All of you know the saying of the Master that one must become as a child to enter the kingdom of heaven and perhaps you have given this great amount of consideration, so I would like to add to it. A child comes into this world with no material possessions, totally dependent on parents or caregivers; innocent and free from the encumbrances of sin and error, essentially pure.<sup>1</sup> There is a great responsibility put upon those who care for children as your parents cared for you and as perhaps you care for your children, your grandchildren, remembering that all are God’s children, to treat all with respect, compassion, equality in the knowing that every soul upon the earth is a precious creation. I wish to honor those who care for those who cannot care for themselves. This is part of my work in spirit, and I have conveyed this through this brother before, but I shall say again for the benefit for all here and beyond this circle. 

So many come into spirit needing love, needing care, needing the assurance that they are loved, needing healing from the many slings and arrows of human life. These are all cared for and so as you care for others on this earth, you lift them up. When you speak, as Stephen<sup>2</sup> pointed out, to their souls, you give the great gift, the most important gift and in this circle of prayer, the asking for the love of God, there is nothing higher. So, all my dear friends, all children of God, remember your souls, remember what is truly being rich. Remember God and be a blessing to all. I thank you so much for this time and I give you all love and hugs. May God bless each one of you. I am your brother and friend in Christ on the celestial pathway to the kingdom of God. I am Fred Rogers. Go in joy and peace. 


**Note 1** One should perhaps be aware of the this from Exodus: Exodus Chapter 20

> You shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them. For I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generation of those that hate me, and showing mercy to thousands of those that love Me and keep My commandments.
