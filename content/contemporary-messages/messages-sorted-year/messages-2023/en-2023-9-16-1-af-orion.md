Orion received by Al Fike

May you be blessed, beloved souls, I am Orion. We make great efforts to support you, to help neutralise what you may consider to be toxins in your atmosphere, in your being, in your minds. For it is important that a purity is maintained, and most importantly, a purity within your mind and your soul which is consistent and, to some degree, immune from the intransigence of the earthly conditions, the human condition. We ask you to be disciplined within your mind, to not allow negative thoughts, ideas, destructive behaviours and patterns, that which is contrary to love, to enter into your thoughts, enter into your actions. This is a very basic principle which you have known from the beginning.

Yet, all around you, the toxic atmosphere of your Earth continues to impede upon you. At times, you allow this in unwittingly. Those around you, who do not understand this principle, may be channels for this, and those loved ones you are most vulnerable to and their behaviours. In this case, it is difficult to rise up beyond this human condition. It is difficult to combat what is plainly evident in your mind and perception, but is not within another. A detachment must build within you, one that is not detached from love, but detached from the darker emotions that prevail within the human condition. For without this discipline, you are battered about by all of these things that prevail. You become vulnerable to negative forces.

You are the subject of an effort on behalf of negative forces to bring you into darkness rather than light. This, unfortunately, has been the case in your environment and Earth for millennia. For these dark forces have been active for a very long time. It is not that God has created this condition, but it is the outcome of the human condition and its creation. Therefore, one must be vigilant, not in fear, but in the strength that comes with wisdom, faith, love and desire for the highest. In this way, you combat the possibilities and neutralise these conditions around you. Those whom you love will benefit from this as well. The strength of your light that you carry, that positivity of love and kind regard for another, these things are important. This is love in action, love manifest in the world and it is done by your thoughts and actions, by the expression of your souls, clear and beautiful within your being, your efforts and life. Prayer, of course, is key. Reaching out to God and being with God often brings about greater light, draws us to you. For the Law of Attraction allows this to be so.

Other minor inhibitions come with your diets and with the overall atmosphere that is toxic in your world. Of this, I mean the material atmosphere. Yes, there is much to combat. There is much to be aware of. There is much that can inhibit our progress together, and each day is a daily battle against that which is inharmonious. Each day presents its challenges. Yet also, each day presents its blessings, the benefits that you draw to yourself through your will, desire and efforts towards light.

Indeed, you have a great ally within you, that of your soul resplendent in light, resplendent in God’s Love. This part of you, this great core and essence of your being which you nourish in prayer, you reach out to God to receive more of, this nourishment, is the great initiator, great power, that you possess to neutralise the darkness. Even within your flesh, it helps to neutralise those elements that are not in harmony with your creation, certainly within your minds, as the influence of the soul percolates up into your consciousness. Thus, your actions are often determined by your soul condition and the connection you have between mind and soul.

We are with you, beloveds. We help to neutralise the atmosphere around you, to throw around you the cloak of protection that will help combat concerted efforts from dark forces to bring you to a place that is out of harmony and that lacks light. How fortunate you are to have such an array of forces by your side and within you to bring light, to assure that light exists around you. Though, you have free will, my beloved and beautiful friends, and these conditions can be neutralised by your thoughts and actions that are out of harmony with God.

You must be vigilant. You must be strong and you must realise and understand the laws that pertain to your existence in the material world. There is much to know, but most importantly, you must be in alignment with God. For in this powerful relationship comes the capacity to neutralise all that is out of harmony and bring it back to harmony. Be in the flow of God’s Will and Love, the condition of light that is offered to you daily. With every breath, be assured that harm will not come to you, provided you listen to your guidance and follow the flow of God’s Will and guidance for you.

You are deeply blessed where many are not, beloved souls. Surely, you see this around you, those that suffer, those who have great catastrophes in their lives, those who are lost, those who suffer great pain and anguish from the events in their life. Yet, you persist. Though your lives certainly have elements of this, you are not so caught up that you are brought down to this level of darkness. Rather, you fight your way back whenever you even touch the darkness. You are healed and uplifted and blessed by your prayers and desire to live in the light, and this you must teach to others. This you must be, the living example for your brothers and sisters. This you are, the light in the world.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am your friend, Orion, and I make efforts, as do many, to help uplift you, to teach you, to remind you, to love you and uphold you. For you are like children in need of parenting, of loving, of ministrations of love. This is given freely and abundantly to each of you. God bless you, beloved souls, and may God truly be known by you, felt by you and blessed by you in your prayers. God bless you. God bless you all in love.
