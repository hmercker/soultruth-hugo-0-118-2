Orion received by Al Fike

There is great light amongst you, my friends. I am Orion and I come to be with you in this time of prayer for gathering together in light, and so light is with you. Many are with you at this moment, for we avail ourselves of every opportunity to be with you in these circumstances. With this portal of light that is here, as powerful as it is, it is not difficult for us to come close, especially when you all desire to be blessed by God, blessed by His great Love. The light flows in and around you, uplifting you and carrying you beyond the earthly conditions to that place that sustains, that uplifts, that helps each one of you in your spiritual aspirations and desires to be close to the Creator of all.

It is good that you take time like this to pray for your brothers and sisters who pray for this gathering that is close. Pray for those who are attending this gathering. The more you pray, the more you are in the light, the less susceptible you are to the human condition and the darkness that surrounds this Earth. It is important that your focus is on the spiritual, on God, on all of those aspects that bring light, so that you are well prepared for the work that is coming. There is much work coming, my friends, much work, opportunities and aspects of work that you may not anticipate, opportunities that are unusual, invitations that come from far off lands, individual souls who know of you or will know of you soon who wish to collaborate, who wish to join forces in light so that more light may penetrate this Earth.

The unfolding of this great transformation of Earth will be quickened by your efforts, your prayers, your light. It is so important, beloved souls, to nurture, to sustain light, around you, in your household with your families, so that you are in an environment that is conducive for us to come close. As you know, God provides these portals, gifts, Lattices of Light in order to sustain and bring close the conditions that are conducive for the soul, the soul’s awakening with the gift of love. It is not so complicated, beloved souls, to be in the light. It merely requires your focus, your desires, your prayers, your thoughts, your intentions.

You have been well educated, each one of you, well educated in this way. It is a matter of application. It is also a matter of faith, to believe, to know, to understand that these mechanisms that God has provided for the nurturance of your being, your soul, your consciousness are readily available to you. You will understand them. It is the application that is often the great challenge in this world. Still, each of you have put forth your dedications, your desires to be in the light, to be in harmony with the laws of God, so God responds in many ways: sending His angels to you, sending us, sending light and blessings, sending bright spirits.

Many, many aspects of light are focused upon you, beloved souls and it is important that you acknowledge this, that within your heart is joy and gratitude. You come to know the upliftment and the blessings that God has for each one of you. Open yourselves to the great Light of the Essence of God. Open yourselves to the many blessings of healings and peace, the knowledge that comes, the truth and understanding that is realised and that all that is not of light dissolves in this environment of light.

Beloved souls, may the blessings be powerful and the understanding be clear and the joy infill you and expand out from you as you continue on this journey of light, this journey of truth, this journey towards the Source of all light and truth. You are sustained and shall be for all the days of your life. You will be blessed and blessed in greater measure every day. You will awaken to many things of God’s universe and you will come to know your true self in all its wonderment and splendor, the truth and light shining through you, the beauty of your soul revealed to yourself through the awakenings, insights and experiences as you continue to seek and to be great in the Hands of God. God bless you, beloved souls. I am Orion and yes, I will accompany you on your travels. I will speak on occasions. There is a plan. There is an unfolding of much to come. Blessings to you, beloved friends. My love is with you, always. God bless you and keep you in His Love.
