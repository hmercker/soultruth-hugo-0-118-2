October 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2023

One Nation CoL, Rock Hill, SC, USA

Matthew received by Elizabeth Mack

Our brother, Jesus, has come to bless us, to bless all upon the Earth. For there is such a need for such an intervention for humankind. I am Matthew of the Bible and I speak to you of the will of the Father, of being in harmony with God’s will as a way of protection for yourselves in these coming and trying times. For there will be many days of disruptions, many ways your lives will be impacted in ways that are less than desirable according to your current conditions. But know this: These are changes in the way that you will be in the future. So do not resist these changes. Allow them. Open to them. Pray to the Father to help you adjust to them and give your love as they come to you and this will be a smoother transition for you from mind consciousness, material consciousness to love consciousness.

It is a big boulder to climb but you, each of you, will be successful in climbing it. For the love within you is great and grows daily. Activate this love even through these bumpy conditions. Some of you have felt these bumpy conditions and you have experienced love as you go through them. Continue to do this and seek the Father’s help to maintain this condition of openness to change.

Jesus walks among you. Jesus walks among those souls who are fighting wars. Jesus walks among those who are at peace in their souls, blessing you, bringing God’s blessings to you. You have nothing to fear. For he is present in your daily lives to assist with this change as we all are. This is a time of tumult and for you, it is less of a struggle for the gifts that you have within you, particularly the Divine Love. Focus upon that. Focus upon your Father. Focus your love to God and all will be a smooth crossing from focussing on the material to focussing on God, to living in harmony, to expressing your love, to living as love. My love is with you. God bless you. I am Matthew, one of many who serves God and who come to join you in prayer. God bless you. God bless you dear, dear children. God bless you.
