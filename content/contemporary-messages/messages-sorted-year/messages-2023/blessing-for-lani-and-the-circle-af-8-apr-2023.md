# Blessing for Lani and the Circle

God bless you beloved souls, my name is Rebecca, and I am one who supports and guides this dear daughter beside me. I was, when Jesus walked the Earth, one of his followers and I am mentioned in the Bible. But like most women of our time, my mention is not that of great significance, but merely as a footnote in history. Yet  indeed, all of these long years that I have been in the spirit world, I inhabited the Celestial Kingdom. It was a swift passage to that place because I followed the truth that the Master spoke and understood it well. It came to my soul easily, and so I walked the Path Divine readily.

Few come to these truths so easily in your day. So much contradicts and detracts from the truth of love, and indeed, many turn away from what is such a simple and powerful truth, that God is Love. That His Love is a real part of the universe and can be a part of you, provided you open your souls and receive it, to ask for it in prayer and supplication to God. How many in your world take time for this, to seek this out, looking for truth within, having those faculties of the soul pointing the way to that which is universal truth and universal in its power to transform and make a soul divine?

Yes, in your world there are many ideas and iterations of truth. Many follow what is more potent in the mind, the material mind than that of the soul. The soul where feelings and insights, intuition,and understanding come with the awakening and opening of those tender parts within, where the heart is leading the way and the mind follows rather than leads. Many in your world believe those who are focused upon their feelings and the deeper parts of themselves are deluding themselves. They wish to judge and say: *“You do not have the path towards power and truth. Rather, you allow that which is within you to fool you and to take you on a journey that is not secure in logic.”* I say to those who are brave enough to go beyond these mindful attitudes and ideas to their very center core of their being, that there is great truth within and in this one can understand truth more readily and more fully than the mind. That they are truly blessed, that they truly know their way, despite all those who would say otherwise. 

Beloved souls of the Earthly world, walk that path less traveled. Be that individual that does not blend in with all the ways and expressions of a world that has gone awry. That those, so many of humanity who are lost in their assumptions and desires to be empowered by mind and thought, are lost in an illusion. For their minds alone cannot possibly comprehend true spiritual reality and understanding. It is for those of you who wish to go further, who wish to delve deeper, who wish to put aside those ideas and concepts of the mind and are brave enough to plumb the depths of their souls. Though this may be fraught with challenges, a reality that is very different from that which has been cultivated in your world at this time, still it comes with many blessings and rewards of love. Rewards that will awaken and bring truths so deep and profound that you will not be swayed from this knowledge. Others cannot bring you to something that is of their ideas and inclinations. Rather, the truth that will be cultivated within your soul will be strong and permanent and beautiful and deep.

It will come with love, the power of Love that is of God, to transform and to awaken. This you must follow and seek as you continue in your pursuit of spiritual awakening and knowledge. As you continue to open your hearts to love, to the Divine Love. These things that I urge you to cultivate and to discover will come to you in time. As you awaken and accept and embrace that which is of our Creator, that which is of truth, it will come in powerful and beautiful ways, at times gentle and at times intense and revelatory. But indeed, God will feed you all the truths that you require and wish to know if you come to Him in supplication and desire to be at-one. It comes on the heels of your prayers, on the heels of that vulnerable and tender place within you, that you may indeed, open yourselves to the profound Touch of God to receive His Love. Thereby, all else will fall into place and come to you in harmony with the peace and timing of your progression. 

Awaken, my beloveds, to the Touch of God. Open yourselves to the profound blessing of His Holy Spirit to touch you and to infill you with God’s Essence. It is here for you to receive, beloveds. Open yourselves. Open yourselves and all will come readily in great peace and joy and awareness and knowing, that place where your soul is at home and desires to be forever. God bless you. I am Rebecca and I love you. God bless you, beloved souls. Be at peace and know that God is here and loves you so very deeply. God bless you, beloveds. I love you.
