# Commitment to the Father’s Love

James Padgett received by Al Fike

So, you come today, my beloved brethren, to pray for the Father’s Love, that eternal blessing that shall be your saving grace. I am James E. Padgett. I come to you today to acknowledge your efforts and your commitment to the truth of the Father’s Love.

How many have come close to this truth but have turned away? How many misunderstand this truth and add embellishments and ideas to it that lead them down different paths and directions beyond the simple truth and the power of the gift of this love? I, for one, came a hair’s breadth from turning away. I was not committed to bringing through these channeled messages in the beginning. I was skeptical. I was even irascible in my rejection of Jesus’ first attempts to bring his message through me.

Yet, Jesus, with all his humility and love and persistence continued to work with me, to be by my side and, for some time, my constant companion. For this is what it took to bring me into alignment with the truth and with Jesus’ efforts to bring the truth to humanity.

Now, if I had turned away, I am sure that there would have been others down the road who would have listened. But, indeed, the time that I lived and the conditions that I lived within, a great war was raging. There were many changes and events in the world that were both wondrous and horrific. This was the time where these messages were required more than ever. Yet, as I look around me today in your world, I see that this time, as well, is in great need of transformation and harmony. So, I urge you, my beloved and beautiful friends, to bring the message of God’s Love to those who will listen, to live the message of God’s Love with every breath you take, to acknowledge this message no matter where it may have come, no matter what words inspired you. But indeed, you opened your heart and soul to God in response to these promptings.

This is what is needed in your world. Those who are willing to be vulnerable to God, those who are willing to stand up for the truth, those who can put aside their judgments and all conditions that are not of love and walk in the light of His Love. Be His instruments, His channels of love, for the world is in great need of change. The world will change, you have been reassured of this. Will you be active participants in a changing world? Will you allow yourself to be transformed with this great gift of Love? Will you walk in the light and be a light? Will you speak of truth and be that glowing light of truth that shall shine upon many souls and be God’s instrument for this purpose?

It is for you, my beloved friends, to take up the banner, the torch of truth, to walk forward. If you wish to honour me and the work that was accomplished through me, then I say to you, be God’s instrument of truth. Walk in the light of truth. Do not allow your doubts and fears to overtake you and turn you away, but march forward, ever forward into the light. God will ensure that your soul will find its transformation. It will be redeemed in love. In time, you too will enter the Celestial Kingdom. This is God’s promise to you. This has been stated in many different ways, through many different channels and mediums and instruments, Jesus being the most prominent and powerful of those instruments.

Will you be God’s instrument? Will you proclaim the truth? Will you walk in the light? The world needs you, my friends. The world is in deep need of you. May you find your way to those gifts and purpose that reside within your soul, finding all the treasures that lay within them, all that is there that may be expressed and developed through God’s Love.

My blessings are with you, my friends. I thank you for your tributes. I, in turn, give you a tribute, for you have overcome the barriers and resistance and all that is in the human condition, to be with God in the truth of His Love. How wonderful you are, beloved souls of God, His children coming to be with Him, leaving behind the vestiges of old and tired ideas of the human race and seeking something new and fresh, yet old and ancient, the power of love to transform you and all that which is around you.

May we walk together, my friends. May we truly be an instrument for God, a channel for His Love and Truth, and that many may find comfort and healing and a path to at-onement with our great Creator. God bless you, my beloved friends. I thank you dearly for your tributes. I am James Padgett. My love is with you. God bless you.
