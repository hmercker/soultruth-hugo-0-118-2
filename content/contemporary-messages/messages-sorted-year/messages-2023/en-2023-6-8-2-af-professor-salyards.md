# Be Open to the Gifts God Presents to You

Professor Salyards received by Al Fike

The world is open to you, my beloved friends. I am Professor Salyards, and I wish to encourage you to step forward. Do not be reluctant when blessings and gifts are offered, contributions from others who wish to add to the efforts that you are making. For that is the whole impetus behind this organization, is it not? To include and to embrace those who wish to be a part of this great movement and light that is being formed by your efforts.

Do you not think that the angels are hard at work helping to organize and coordinate your gathering together and inspiring those who wish to contribute to step forward and do so with confidence? Do not greet them with reluctance beloved souls, but greet them with joy, acceptance, and desire to enfold them into this great effort and flow of work and collaboration together. So when a door opens, I would suggest that rather than study that door and wonder what is on the other side, to affirm within your heart and soul that it is indeed an opportunity that God has placed before you. And then when that confirmation comes, step through with joy, step through willingly.

Now, with all things upon the earthly plane, what may come as a particular plan or objective or idea may not be fulfilled in the way that it is presented. This does not mean that it is a failure or that what has been given is not in harmony with God and God's laws. Rather as time goes by and individuals come to change their perspectives and are more deeply guided, then the outcomes will change and evolve accordingly. I say this to encourage you not to put roadblocks for those who are willing to serve and to give of themselves. But have faith that whatever that offer is, whatever the intention is, that indeed God will ensure that it will be in harmony with the overall plan and that you, beloved souls, must have faith that this will be the case rather than reluctance or reticence. Enthusiasm and openness are important.

Clarity is not always possible in the beginning, and yet the impetus, the intention is presented. Indeed, unless you receive some powerful guidance that suggests that you do not accept the offer given or the proposal that is on the table, I suggest that you accept and embrace it. There will be times when God will guide you accordingly and give counsel to those who are offering of themselves. At other times, they will get their guidance personally, but know that in these collaborations there are many dynamics and many aspects to these efforts and that they will evolve. They will come together into a harmonious conglomeration of the efforts of many. It is a test as you continue to walk upon this road. Often you are encouraged to set aside those barriers, those things that cause reluctance or fear or elicit some bias within you, within your mind. As you experience this then is this not an opportunity for your own growth? Is this not an opportunity for this organization to grow and to evolve?

Indeed, there are times when you must step forward blindly but in faith that this is God's Will. Know the feelings in your hearts, beloved souls, and go with those feelings. For that is where God touches you and guides you so that you may find your way upon a journey, upon this great effort, to open the doors to many souls. For the doors need to be opened, beloveds. The doors are many and will draw in many unique individuals. Some of which you will have some challenges to understand and to relate to. Others you will know as a sort of kinship and harmony between you, which will come immediately. But in this journey you must learn flexibility, wisdom, and clarity. Most of all, you must be loving and kind and forthright in your love. For is this not the practice of love flowing abundantly, powerfully out into the world? Be that channel of love my beloved brothers and sisters. Accept those who are wayward, those who are different, those who are in great need. They too are God's children, and they too require your ministrations.

There are times when the darkness creeps in, and you must know those times and be wary and wise to respond with the strength and the yet subtlety that diverts the power of the dark forces from your doorstep. All is a learning, my beloved and beautiful friends. God will place before you many opportunities to learn and to grow and to express love. Challenges, there will be many. Rewards, there will be many. All comes with your footfalls and desires to be with God, to serve God, and to be a light in the world. So you will be, and so you will serve. So you will come to understand the depth and breadth of a soul in alignment with God, serving God, infilled with the essence of God. These things come with each day, a gift, a blessing, an opportunity.

May you continue down this road, a road that will bring great rewards, great possibilities opening up gifts and potentials you have no idea at this time exists within you and collectively. And so it will be beloved souls, so it will be.

May God bless you. I am your Professor Salyards, and I'm happy to speak to you today. My precious charges who are seeking, who are growing, who are brightening with each day. God bless you. God bless you all in His Love.
