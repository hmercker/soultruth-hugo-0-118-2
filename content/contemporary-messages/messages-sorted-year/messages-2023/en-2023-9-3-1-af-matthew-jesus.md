Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Matthew & Jesus received by Al Fike

May a great blessing of the Father's Love, fall into your souls, beloved, beautiful friends of the Earth. I am Matthew. I come to speak of your daily existence, how important it is to choose to be with God. As you look around you and you see many who are asleep, who live a life filled with routines repeated day in and day out so that they are acquiesced into their slumbers so that life does not possess the rich meaning and purpose that yours do. A life that starts with prayer. It is focused upon serving God and serving humanity in love. It is fulfilled by the great blessings of God upon you. In this way, how can you acquiesce into such routines and slumbers when the soul is being awakened by the Father's Love?

When you are feeling and knowing things that are not necessarily of this world of yours, when you are contemplating and considering the great journey of life and as your angel friends come close and they guide, teach and bring the blessings of love, healing and peace, so your eyes are opened to a wider vista, a wider understanding of life. Yet, in this way often you feel alone that those who are living in these routines and accepted paradigms of thought and perception do not understand your perspective, and are not in alignment with your goals and your ambitions.

For they operate from the material mind, and all the demands that come with it. The soul is ignored, unknown and unloved. Where your goals are to awaken and love your own true self and to love God in the process of this awakening. How fortunate you are, for you build a legacy for yourselves, not only upon this earthly plane of yours, but as you enter into the spirit world, the benefits of your efforts will truly be felt. You will find yourselves in light. You will find yourselves comfortable with the transition from the material to the spiritual. You will find the rewards of your efforts to be a light in the world and to serve God and humanity. All of these things come to those who have applied the Laws of Love and have truly been a part of God's plan for the salvation of humanity.

So much to be gained by a simple dedication and prayer. It does not need to be every moment, every breath, merely some time set aside with each day to be with God, to seek earnestly the Great Blessing of His Love. In this simple blessing, the universe of God opens to you. The truth is revealed, the perceptions that are not seen by those entrenched in the material conditions. Yet, you see and can see, feel and know the subtler things in life that bring greater joy and fulfillment. How blessed you are, beloved souls, to know the Touch of God upon you. To seek your own salvation and love, to be close to God. What more can a soul desire than this? What is more fulfilling than this?

All the material wealth cannot equal the wealth of the soul awakened in love. You, beloved and beautiful souls of earth, have discovered this truth and are upon the path that leads you to greater at-onement with God. May you find your ways readily. May all that inhibits you fall away with the Touch and power of God's Love. May you see yourselves as you truly are, a precious and beautiful creation of God, worthy of all that is of God, His Love and blessings bestowed upon you. So much is given by your efforts to move beyond the constrictions of the material perceptions and attitudes, this human condition, so that you are freed and awakened, that you dive deep into the soul where all is revealed, and love is the atmosphere of this reality, this dimension of truth within you.

Be of good cheer, my beloved friends, for you are truly blessed and well on your way to discover the true meaning of life, the true purpose that you have in life, the fulfillment of all that your souls desire. The light pours in. The acknowledgement and joy is felt. You are truly becoming God's precious children upon the Path Divine. God bless you and keep you in light. I am Matthew, and I love you. Beloved souls, truly, I love you.

The hand of God is upon you, beloveds. I am **Jesus**. I come to bring a blessing to you. To tell you how much you are loved. How much I love you. How much the angels of the Celestial Kingdom love you. How much the bright spirits that are in the higher spheres of life love you. How much other beings from far away love you, how much God loves you, beloveds. You are truly loved, shall be for all eternity. Know the power and glory of this love that will transform and awaken and expand within you. All that you can be shall be realized in love. All that God intends for you to be shall be awakened in love.

You are truly blessed, beloved, and know, know my beloveds, know truly, know deeply how loved you are. For you are indeed a creation of God, the highest of creations, the greatest Love is given by God to all His creations who possess a soul. God bless you, my love is with you, God bless you.

A gift of peace and the light shines forth.

God bless you.
