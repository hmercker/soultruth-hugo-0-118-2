# Communion with God is subtle, Gentle and Requires Persistent Effort

April 11<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Online Prayer Circle, Sechelt, BC, Canada

Matthew received by Al Fike

A love of God is readily available to you. It is but a wish and prayer away. As you offer those words, *“Dear and Beloved God, Open my soul to the great inflowing of Your love.”* And so you have today asked for this gift and in the days to come, you will ask and God will respond, accordingly. It is such a simple journey, my beloved friends. It is a journey that requires some effort but not extraordinary effort. It requires some faith but not extraordinary faith. It requires some trust but not exceptional trust. Yet, as you have been told many times, when you put your faith in God, put your trust in the blessings of God, listen to the guidance of God, seek His touch upon you always, then how your life may change, how the blessings of God may flow. It does not mean that you have changed your ways, your life to such a great extent that all is different. Rather, it merely is the touch that God has upon you that urges you toward that which is harmony and peace and grace.

As you continue on upon this journey, many things will change. Much will be revealed to you. Your souls will open to the truth of God but God’s transformative love comes as a gentle breeze. It touches you but it does not force anything upon you. All things of love are gentle and this does not require great coercion or insistence. My beloved friends, when you come to God, my hope is that it will be an easy relationship, something that reflects the gentleness of God and reflects the power of the touch of God. For it is in these two things, this gentle whisper and breadth of God that comes with the Holy Spirit, combined with the power of its transformative qualities that reflects this Divine path that you are healed and transformed.

You often wonder why things do not happen to you in a dramatic way, the great blessings and the visions, the power of light, the glory, the bliss of the touch of God does not come to you in all its wonderment. I say to you that at the beginning, and most of you are at the beginning of the journey, it is a gentle thing. It is a subtle thing. It is also persistent and will come to you with a consistency and regularity reflecting your prayers, your efforts daily. In time, visions and awareness will come. In time, you will know the great bliss and revelations of God’s touch upon you in such a way that you may feel overwhelmed by the power of it. Yet, it is not usual that it is the case that it comes subtly, incrementally. It is given to you gently and with great respect to your will and desire. God does not circumvent your will. Rather, God moves with your will and your desires.

You will come to know God in accordance with the intensity of your yearning, of the desire of your being seeking out the truth, seeking out God. Each of you has the capacity to truly know God and to truly experience the power of God’s touch but it must come in accordance to the laws in action. The law of desire plays its part. So if you find that you have not felt that this touch is so gentle, so mild that you barely recognize it, then come to look at your own desire, your own efforts to receive this gift. For these things are readily available to everyone upon your world, the spirit world, the Universe. Yet,  this too obeys the law. All come in accordance with your faith and desire, how open you are, how vulnerable you become to the touch of God.

May you find your way to that place that is revelatory, that will produce for you an experience so profound that all doubt, all resistance will fall away. It is possible and I pray that you will experience the profound touch of God that will change you forever.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Matthew. I am happy to be with you today as you pray. Pray in earnest, my beloved friends. Pray with deep desire. Pray from the depths of your soul and in this a great washing of God’s love will come to you and awaken you and heal you and bring you profound peace and joy. All comes in good time. All is waiting for you, beloved souls. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door shall open. God bless you. God bless you all.
