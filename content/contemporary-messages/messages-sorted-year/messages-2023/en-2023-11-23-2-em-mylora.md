# Healing the Creatures

November 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2023

One Nation CoL, Rock Hill, SC, USA

Mylora received by Elizabeth Mack

I am Mylora and I come because of your desires and acknowledgement that all of life upon the Earth requires healing. You have seen for yourselves the destructive powers of human beings, upon not just mankind but upon the creatures who live upon the Earth. You are blessed in knowing that they are creatures of God and as such, they deserve your care and even your love. They are innocents. And they are hurting under this human condition which is destroying their homes, their environment. More importantly, the human condition is retarding the soul development of the souls upon this Earth. You are willing to uplift these souls in prayer, to uplift these beings that live upon the Earth by asking for God’s mercy and healing for the Earth and all who live upon it.

I am here at your request and because our Father wills it. Again and again our Heavenly Father will answer these prayers requesting love for all creatures and humans and spirits who live upon the Earth. Our Father is magnanimous in His offerings of love and I, in particular, have a great love for these creatures who suffer so. So I come to bring you a healing, to bring those beings upon the Earth who have no souls but are here according to God’s laws, God’s will who also require a loving, gentle blessing from God. You may have noticed that there are many reactions to human beings by the natural world: animals chasing and hurting human beings; animals coming out of the sea, dying. The Earth, like everything in God’s Universe, requires love. So join with me now and extend and express your love to each other, to your brothers and sisters, to those beings in your homes, by your homes and across the lands and throughout the world. Extend your love. Let it reach to all these creatures in need as well as all the souls upon this Earth. For all are in need and you can help them. And together, we will heal many. I am your sister, Mylora and Lotus Blossom joins me.
