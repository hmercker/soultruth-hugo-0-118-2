# Love the World

April 4<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Francis of Assisi received by Al Fike

I merely wish to encourage you to love the world. For many of you, it is spring emerging. Appreciate the power of God’s Love for the world, that He created such beauty, the forces of creation, of love, of life emerging from the Earth and bringing all its fruits and beauty and glory forth. God created a wondrous place of love. For all that you see, appreciate all of this and be in harmony with God’s Creation.

May God bless you. I am Francis and I love you dearly, beautiful creations of God, magnificent in light, I love you. God bless you.
