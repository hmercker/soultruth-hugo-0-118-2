Helen Padgett received by Al Fike

Helen. I merely wish to say a few words of acknowledgement to my dear husband and soulmate, how much I love him. And I, too, honour him for his work. For I have benefitted and many, many souls have benefitted from this work that Jesus initiated, and my dear Ned accepted his invitation. So, we are here 100 years in the future where I see that the word of Godâ€™s Truth and Love continues to flourish in the world. And it will grow, my friends. It will grow and be commonplace in your world.  Have faith in this, pray for this, and be a part of the proliferation of this truth.

May god bless you. I am Helen and I, too, work for the truth and the dissemination of this truth, not only in your world, but in many worlds in the spirit planes. God bless you. God bless you all. My love is with you.
