# Message for the Coming Year

January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2023

Sechelt, B.C. Canada

Received by Al Fike  



Beloved Souls, I am Orion. This coming year will bring you great blessings, will open doors not yet experienced or entered therein. There will be insights and what you call downloads of guidance and perception so that you may be more clear upon your path and your purpose. God has much in store for you, my friends. Much will come unexpectedly, spontaneously and powerfully. For the time for preparation grows short and the time needed for the expressions of your gifts, the openings and awakenings of your soul, the development of your efforts together. All of these things require further growing within, greater depth of understanding, especially within your soul and your soul consciousness. For how can we proceed without those aspects of your being greatly developed and nurtured and expressed? 

Though many of you feel this is a long way off, you’re not so attuned as to be competent in these expressions and insights in the flow of experience that comes with the soul in alignment with God. I say to you, you are much closer than you think and indeed, I use the word “think” as the material mind, because indeed that place within you is so very well nurtured and developed is the least of your gifts. The greater portion of your gifts lie within your soul and the mind of your soul and that in alignment with your spirit mind, will bring many manifestations, insights, truths, teachings, expressions that are greatly needed in your world.

This coming year is the year that will greatly challenge your own paradigms and will bring new ones forth so that you may indeed live in a world as a child of God, an instrument of light, a teacher of truth, a channel of love, these things greatly magnified and exemplified through you and within you. This is the time when you are on the cusp of great change and you must precede these changes in the world by manifesting and experiencing the great changes within you. It is necessary for you to see and experience these things first hand so that you can be a powerful teacher. So that you may understand as others go through their experiences in a changing world. This will give you what you require to be a channel of truth, to have wisdom, to have insight and compassion and so you will not struggle with what is presented before you. You will come to know that place within you that often carries fear and skepticism and doubt and in this you must release these things and move forward in faith, confidence and love. Love for yourself, love for your Heavenly Father, love for humanity, for it is love that breaks the barriers. It is love that awakens the many gifts within you. It is love that brings deep compassion and insight as you connect with many in your world. 
 
An exciting time, my beloved friends, a time of great flux and change, a time where you are truly confronted with those parts of you within your consciousness that continues to adhere to you and are truly not part of you. Your consciousness is shifting. It is time for you to adjust, to accept, to release and joyfully so, those things that are not truly compatible and in harmony with this new and changing you, this wondrous being that is growing in love, emerging. Now much of you has emerged from below the ground, and starting to stretch and grow above ground. It is not subverted in an unconscious way. Rather, it is coming to consciousness. You are coming alive, beloveds, coming alive. An awareness grows. The petals of that beautiful flower of your soul, opening one by one. How beautiful you are becoming. How beautiful you are. 

Grow in the Father’s love. Grow in the awakening soul. Accept all that is coming to you, my beloved friends. For everything, whether that be a challenge, a blessing, a joy or even grief is a gift. A gift that will help you set your feet firmly upon this path that God has designated and has gifted you in love. My beloved friends, we walk together. We walk together. Whether you are challenged and struggling or are joyful and in that state of grace and freedom, we are there to witness all, and to support you in all. It is emerging and awakening. The pupae is turning into a butterfly and so the wings shall spread and the glory of God’s Creation that is the unique soul, your soul, will manifest all its beauty and glory. I anticipate greatly what will emerge and have great joy and anticipation of what is emerging at this time. You are beautiful. You are loved and you shall be glorious.  God bless you, my beloved friends, beautiful souls of God. God bless you, beloveds. I am Orion and I love you.
