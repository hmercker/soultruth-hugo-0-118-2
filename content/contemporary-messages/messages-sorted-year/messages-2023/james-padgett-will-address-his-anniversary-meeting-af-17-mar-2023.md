Blessings to you my friends, I am James Padgett. I look forward to addressing the crowd that will gather to commemorate my passing into the spirit world.<sup>1</sup> I am always happy when those who aspire towards God’s Love gather together in what you call Circles of Light. They are indeed living and practicing the truths that came through me from our beloved brother Jesus and others from the Celestial Kingdom, that this work continues the proliferation of this truth grows. You, my beloved brothers and sisters, continue to nurture this flame of truth in the world. This is most important at this time as you have been told many times. So, we will work together as always, to bring this truth forward. 

Our dear daughter asks, what sphere did I enter when I passed, and I say to her that I entered into the high second sphere and grew quickly to progress into the third and so on, until I entered the Celestial Kingdom, which did not take a great deal of time. For as you might imagine, the support that I had, my wife, my grandmother, and Jesus, amongst others who would encourage me, pray with me, and show me the way. And so it will be with you, my friends, as you enter into this world of spirit. You will find yourself greatly uplifted, guided and encouraged. This is the way of the Divine Love, the way of God, that each soul is given what they require to grow and to be in harmony with His Laws of Love.

Though as you are well aware, free choice has its effects upon the progression of the individual. Indeed, when you enter into a sphere of light, which I did, then it becomes far easier to grow in the Divine Love since you are already grounded in this truth and have a practice of receiving it. So, the environment in which you will inhabit will encourage and be very much a blessing.

My friends, I will continue my message later this day with others who are listening. Indeed, remember that when you celebrate me, what you are truly celebrating is bringing of the truth of Divine Love to the world, for this is what I accomplished. This is the only true accomplishment in my life. To allow this truth to come through me and to be a channel for it was a great honour and blessing, even though in the beginning I resisted. I did not believe, I was skeptical. Yet, our beautiful angel friends continued to persist and to uphold me until I came to that place of realisation and knowledge where they could indeed bring these truths forward. So, you today continue in this legacy. You continue to bring through the Truth of God’s Love and bring it to others.

May you continue to flourish in the Love. May your gifts continue to bring light and comfort and truth to others. In so doing, you will be blessed, my beloved friends. You will know the great blessings of God and the presence of the angels, and the light shed upon you always. God bless you my friends, and keep you in His Love. My love is with you. My admiration and appreciation for the work you do is great. I honor you, beloved souls, for your efforts. God bless you. God bless you all. I am James. My love is with you.
