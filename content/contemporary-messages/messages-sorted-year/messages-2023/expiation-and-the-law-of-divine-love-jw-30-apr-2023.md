# Expiation and the Law of Divine Love

April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Location not specified

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  


I come, I am your sister in Christ, Ann Rollins. My dear ones, wherever you may be, may the blessings of God’s love flow into each one of your souls in great abundance. I have been in spirit many years and my home is in the Celestial heavens where the spheres have no numbers. 

In the early 1900s, I wrote many messages through my dear grandson, James Padgett, and I should like to address one in particular<sup>1</sup> which I encourage you to explore. It was a message on forgiveness and forgiving oneself and allowing the love of God to move you beyond your guilt but also I discussed the topic of expiation and how even though the Law of Compensation as it is called, *‘Where ‘as you reap, so shall you sow’*, is truly a law, that this law is superseded by yet a greater one called the Law of Divine Love. 

There have been many messages delivered to the Divine Love community through our brother Al Fike and our sister Maureen Cardoso, as well as my brother Jimbeau here, on this process of expiation on the Law of love. Yet again, I encourage you, most especially when you are going through this process and struggling to review these messages, for they are powerful and filled with truth and above all, that you go into prayer and open up your heart to God, that God may open up your soul and bring the opening of this Law of Love to you. 
     
We here in the celestial realms are very aware of the process of expiation and as I have just mentioned we have discussed it many times, so I wish to add something and that is the feeling of depression, of unworthiness, of shame or guilt or doubt or fear that comes to one when they are going through such expiation. I also would like to address those who feel that they suffer from what is called manic depression, bipolar disorder, or even schizophrenia. Let me say firstly, that all souls suffer from these maladies to a greater or lesser degree. But those who deal with this on a daily basis, who really feel the dichotomy between depression and bliss and feel as if they are on a roller coaster ride, I wish to say to those souls and to all here that it is simply a matter of being more sensitive to the separation that one feels from love, from God’s love. You would be amazed to know how many in spirit considered great writers, poets, and saints, suffered deeply from feeling separated from the love of God - where the mind simply rules and the heart in pain is reluctant to open. Yet I tell you nothing that you don’t already know, when I say when you allow your feelings to come to the fore, when you open your heart to God, whether you cry out in pain or simply to be at one in bliss, this soul longing lifts you up into the Grace of God, into joy. 
    
So, how does one stay there in this world of woe and distractions and so many changes? It does require focus which seems to be a word associated mostly with the mind, but I will tell you here, be in your heart as often as you can. The mind will take care of itself. Allow your feelings, allow your longings to go to the Creator. And whether you are ultra-sensitive to the highs and lows or someone going through a temporary expiation, this is the way. 

This is the gift, this is the balm, this healing in the Love of God. Oh, how we wish this for all of you every day in every moment. For we see your destiny is Divine. Your path from the mortal to the Divine Angel is assured and we shall always be with you when you ask, when you call upon us. Please remember this. I shall step back in this beautiful circle of souls to be in this prayer in the Love of God. 

I am your sister and eternal friend in Christ. I am Ann Rollins. May God bless you.
