Keea Atta Kem received by Al Fike

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea Atta Kem.

When you are in distress, when you are in need, when you are longing to be filled up with love, these are the times when you must go to prayer and seek the great gifts, the inflowing of the Father's Love into your souls. For this one gift brings many blessings. This one gift soothes the troubled heart and mind, brings peace. It heals the aches and pains of the body. It awakens the deeper perceptions of the soul. Each and every child who goes to God in this way, with sincere longing, asking for this gift, is blessed in many, many ways.

I know your journey upon the Earth plane has its challenges and unpredictability. That, because of the free will of humanity, there are many acts, actions and thoughts that come as a response to this gift of free will. The journey that you take upon the earthly plane is not altogether predictable. Nor do you have insights often to the journey that you will take. But I want to assure you, beloved souls, that as you pray and ask to be guided, as you seek to be on the path of love and in alignment with God, you will be able to know and perceive the significant events of your life that will come.

It is important that you open your hearts, that you open the perceptions of your souls, that you open the desires that come from both the mind of the soul and your material mind in alignment with God. In this way, you will come to know the truth and the journey that you take. It will not be a great mystery, though the details may not be furnished by God. The theme of your journey will be conscious and true.

You will find your way upon a path that God has designated for you. You will be able to see your purpose and your destiny as God's instruments in the world. You will be able to release the barriers and inhibitions to this journey of light. You will have the strength and fortitude to walk the Path Divine and stay within the limitations of this path, not veering into darkness or chaos, but walking in the harmony and joy that is God's Path of Love.

In this way, God will guide you readily. God will show you each footstep. With each footfall will come the acknowledgement of your soul, joyfully and gleefully, accepting the Will of God. In this way, where harmony resides, where truth is your mantle, conscious and alive within your being, you will find that life will become easier. Despite those conditions and situations that impede your progress, because of the human condition weighing you down or putting barriers before you, you will find a way. You will find freedom. The choices that you make will be in harmony with the laws of God, the laws of His Love and thereby bringing harmony. Thereby aligning you with God. Thereby being guided, uplifted and blessed.

My beloved and beautiful friends, lights in the world, our desire, those of us who reside in the Celestial Kingdom, wish only that you live in light. That all the conditions that are dark in the world may not touch you and may not influence you. That you may know the freedom and joy of walking this path of truth and light. That you may come to know God in the fullness of your soul's perceptions, in the awakenings of your gifts and all that comes with the Touch of God upon you.

Each of you desires this. Each of you makes great effort to walk this path of love. And each of you see within your life the progress that you have made and the blessings that have come. Your perceptions of these things will intensify. The blessings that you have known will be meagre compared to what will come. The perceptions that you have will open wide with a depth and breadth that will astound you. These are the blessings that come with the Father's Love. This is why we urge you time and time again to seek this Love, to ask for it in your prayers. To truly ask for it, not just from your mindful desire and acknowledgement of this truth, but from the yearnings and feelings of your soul, seeking the succor of God. Seeking closeness. Seeking at-onement.

This is the way. This is what our beloved brother Jesus taught. This is what has brought many, many souls into the Celestial Kingdom where the truth is known by all, expressed by all, and souls transformed beyond the human condition to that of the Divine. Seek and ye shall find, my beloved and beautiful friends. Seek with earnestness and longing and all will come to you as a great blessing. The onrush of the Essence of God infilling you and transforming you in love.

God bless you, beloved souls. I am Keea Atta Kem and I love you. I love you dearly, and shall continue to be by your side as you walk the path divine. God bless you and keep you in His Love. God bless you.
