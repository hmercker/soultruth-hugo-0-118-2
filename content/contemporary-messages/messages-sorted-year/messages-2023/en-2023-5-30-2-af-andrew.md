Andrew received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am Andrew. I come to assure you and pray with you and join you in this light, as these Living Waters pour upon you the Essence of God, the vitality that awakens the soul. So, we are given this gift, this Touch from God, conveyed by the Holy Spirit upon you, and so, we come in unity and desire to know this holy Touch, to be transformed by the Essence of God.

Beloved souls, within you is a seeking part, a yearning part of you, that is seeking this love and yearning for its inflowing. Can you feel this within you? Can you acknowledge this yearning, this place that is not fulfilled without the gift that is offered? For God offers this gift freely, without judgment, without restriction. It is given in love. It is given to uplift, no matter the circumstances, no matter what is and has been in your life. This gift is offered for you to be uplifted and healed, transformed and carried into light and truth.

May you respond to God’s invitation. May you seek the Touch, the holy Touch of God. This is what the mystics of old speak of. This is what the prophets have prophesied. This is what many have felt, but have not given a name to it. Many of you have both felt and named this gift, and in this you have given it greater power to uphold you and to transform you. In your prayers and desires, you have opened the door for the Holy Touch upon your soul.

Continue to seek this benediction, my beloved friends. Continue to ask God to open the door to great light and truth, healing and love. For what more could a soul want than fulfill its desire to be with God? To do so consciously is a great benefit to all those who wish to open that door through prayer. Your prayer can be simple, but it must be heartfelt. Without the true yearnings and desires of the soul, a prayer, merely of the mind, cannot elicit the blessing of Divine Love. For with the yearning and feeling of the soul and heart, the laws are triggered and obeyed and the response is given.

It is simple, beloved souls, but it requires your honesty, your true desire and openness, a vulnerability to God. Put aside your armour. Put aside that tattered garment that you have carried, in the thought that you are protecting yourself. But really, all that you do is keep yourself from God and from your true self. Let go of these things that hold you in fear and ignorance, in what you call ego and ambition. Rather, come to God as a child, as our beloved Master has spoken of. Come to God in earnestness and innocence and all will be given abundantly, without judgement, without restriction.

The opportunity is now, my beloved, beautiful friends. The opportunity to truly be changed and transformed in love. This highest love, this greatest gift is here for you, beloved souls. May we be together in this beautiful condition, this condition of light and to be in unity, to know that we are truly brothers and sisters in this world. For God created all of us, and God has a purpose and a destiny for all of us. May we find that purpose, may we travel the road of that destiny that is intended by God. In this we will find deep fulfillment and joy, deep love and deep truth.

May God bless you, beloved souls. I am Andrew and I come to you to be in prayer, to uplift you, and to speak to you of the great Truth of God’s Love. God bless you. God bless you all.
