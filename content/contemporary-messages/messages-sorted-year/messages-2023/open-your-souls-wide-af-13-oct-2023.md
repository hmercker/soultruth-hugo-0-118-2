# Open Your Souls Wide to God’s Blessing and Love  

October 13<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Laurelville, PA, U.S.A.

Received by Al Fike  


Open your souls wide, beloveds, for the power of the Holy Spirit is with us. Take full advantage of the gifts that God is giving at this moment. Be uplifted and blessed in this gift. Say to God, *“Open my soul that I may receive and know the blessings of your love.”* Say this with all earnestness and you will be blessed mightily. God bless you. I am with you. I am Jesus and I, too, pray for this gift. God bless you.
