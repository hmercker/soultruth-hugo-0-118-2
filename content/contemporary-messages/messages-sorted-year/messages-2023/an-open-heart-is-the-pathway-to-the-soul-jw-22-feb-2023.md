# An Open heart is the Pathway to the Soul

February 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



I am here your brother in God’s love on the path of Divine Love. I am Charles, Charlie Chaplin. Oh, my beautiful friends I am delighted to join you in your prayer to feel your aspirations to be free, to be in joy. Your feelings are the doorway to the opening your hearts that your souls may be blessed. God’s love comes in on the wings of your aspirations and your longings before even a single word is uttered. And though you may find in your prayer the words that connect you to your longings, it is an open heart that is your pathway to the soul. 
   
I was able to express myself in film mostly without words and yet, the intention, whether it be love and laughter or fear and failure, whatever the intention was, the message was conveyed because I allowed myself, despite all my flaws, to speak from my heart, saying so much more than words could ever say. When you come into this silent prayer trust your feelings. If you are wounded, if you are afraid, if you are in doubt, if you are troubled, if you feel unworthy, give this to God, Who heals all wounds, Who lifts up  every soul, Who answers every prayer that is real. 
 
You may ask yourself if you are in any kind of doubt, what brought me here this evening? Even my friend here who I speak through did not know why but he was guided, and I guided him to this circle tonight. 

I wish to not fill you with words but fill you with hope. The hope of consciousness in the love of God and the hope of awakening and of healing, the hope of this world to be changed, the hope of peace, and above all the hope of the love of God to transform you. This I know to be true. 
 
I leave you now to be in a place of silence that your heart may speak to God, and I shall join you there. I thank you for allowing me to come. With a smile as wide as the ocean, with a joy as high as a mountain,  and with a love that never ends. May God bless you. 
 
I am your brother in Christ, Charlie Chaplin.
