God bless you, beloved souls, I am Luke. The world is in a process of regeneration though what you see is difficult to understand as regeneration. Indeed, there are many changes happening and in the process of these changes will come harmony for your material world. That harmony comes with greater light. It comes with love and God’s plan for the salvation of humanity that is not just for humanity but for the world. And so, great forces are enacted and building so that this change may happen in such a way that all may be graced with the outcome of harmony and peace. As you gain in light, so you contribute to the harmony of the world. As you subscribe to this transformation, both within and around you, so you are harbingers of what is to come. 

There will be many places in the world that will regenerate, many species that will return to the Earth and the world will be reborn in light. Continue to pray for this, beloved souls. Continue to set your sights on what is to come and with faith and trust in God’s plan. Much will come that will be surprising, beautiful, and glorious, a reflection of God’s creation, a reflection of God’s laws in action, a reflection of harmony which is intended. Feel the joy within your heart as you consider the changes that are coming, changes that are necessary, changes that will bring about greater harmony in the world and changes that will bring greater joy to you, beloved souls. It all comes in a great flow, an onrush of God’s blessings and intentions for this beautiful jewel of a planet that is God’s creation and once more shall reflect the beauty and wonderment of that creation. 

You will see, my beloved friends, the power of God’s handiwork, God’s blessings upon the world, and you will see great changes, great healing and great peace. Be assured, beloved souls, that each of you who ascribes to the truth of God’s love and continues to strive toward the realization of this love through you and within you, that you will be a part of this new world, this new beginning with its transformation into light. May God bless you, beloved souls. May you be in alignment with the will of God and the expression of God’s will in this world so that you will know peace and joy. Greater wisdom will come to you. You will come to realize the purpose of this transformation, the journey that it must take and you will appreciate the power of God’s touch on the world and on you. 

God bless you, beloved souls. May your eyes open. May love abound within you and may you be at peace, beloveds, deep peace with the realization that God’s will will be done on this Earth as it is in heaven. God bless you. I am Luke. My love is with you, beloved souls.
