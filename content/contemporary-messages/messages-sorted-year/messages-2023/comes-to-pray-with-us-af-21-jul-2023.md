I am Mary. I come to be with you in your prayers today to pray with you, to minister to you, to help bring light to each one of you. It is not just I who comes, but it is many from the Celestial Kingdom who come to be with you in prayer, each one standing with you as you seek to complete this Circle of Light in prayer, to be in the presence of God, His Grace flowing upon you, the blessings of light, healing and love for each one of you.

The world is in need of light. As you elicit light through your prayers, so you bring greater light to your world, the possibility of God’s Touch becomes more powerful and clear as you open those portals and possibilities of blessings to you and through you to many. I urge you to continue to pray for the gift of God‘s Love, to pray for the light that comes with His Love, to pray for all that which is His Touch upon you and upon this world.

For you open the floodgates through your prayers as you are intent and intense with your prayers, the desires for God’s blessings. This determines a flood, the quantity of light that will pass through and be with you and amongst you and with humanity.

You play an important role, beloveds, beautiful souls, to bring the light to the world, to bring it through the mechanisms that you are so aware of, the truth that comes as you pray for this great gift of love. Many are benefiting from your prayers. Many are being blessed at this very moment, those whom you have prayed for, and many who are connected to you, through this great Lattice of Light that has formed as you continue to weave the bonds of love together, to make this beautiful tapestry of light for God.

Be at peace, beloveds. Know that God loves you so, each of you precious in His sight. You are being blessed, His Love available to each one of you. Seek it with your heart, your desires to be blessed by it, so that more of this gift may enter into your souls, awakening you with each prayer incrementally passing through, into you, into all of you, until there comes a time when you have been substantially transformed by this love, that you may act upon the gifts and blessings that this love brings. That you may truly be a light in the world.

You are loved, my beloved and beautiful children of God. I love you. Many love you. Share your love with one another. Acknowledge the great gift of life, the great blessing of this fellowship, the great bond that is created as you pray together, the many gifts that flow as you are together in your yearnings for God. God bless you, beloveds. I am with you, as are many. We pray with you. We pray for the world. We love you and we love the world.

May His Gifts flow powerfully. May you feel it in a palpable way, the Touch of God upon you. God bless you. I am Mary, and I love you all so very much, my brothers and sisters on the Path Divine. We all walk forward to greater light, to at-onement with our Creator. God bless you. I love you. I am Mary and I love you.
