# Go into Nature and go to God

My dear kind mice, it is I, your sister Clare. 

Do not wonder whether God has heard your prayers for the intentions of your souls not only rise to the soul of God but create a chord of harmony on earth and throughout the spheres. 

What is important in these days ahead is to stand on your own two feet, whether you are incapacitated in the physical or not because my expression means relying on God alone, your being a force on earth, sharing your gifts, and minimizing your distractions. I do not expect nor does anyone here for you to join a convent or for you to be in a monastery cloistered away from the world, but to be mindful of your time and how you spend it in the days ahead. For you know in your souls that when you devote your hours to God in whatever form of prayer connects you, when you devote your time like this, the blessings are Mighty, the rewards Great! 
 
I might want to add here for my brother who is taking this message and for all, the importance of stepping out in nature that you may be grounded, taking your shoes off on the earth, in the sand, in the water, in creation. I tell you this has a powerful healing effect and the more you are distanced from the natural, the more you are influenced by the artificialities of life. For to go into nature in the natural world and to feel your connection to what God has created opens the door for your soul to ascend in prayer resulting in not only a transformation in your spiritual life, but a healing in the physical, in the emotional. All these realms are interconnected and being in harmony is the natural state of things imbued with the Divine. 

Ah, if the earth could only, but you surely can and send a sign to all. You may have noticed that many go into nature bringing all the appliances and appendages of lower frequencies, lower energies, and distractions, making it difficult for themselves to be in a state of peace and harmony. So, find a place that is undisturbed and just spend time there listening to the birds, putting your feet in the waters, walking along the grass, smelling the flowers and asking God to bless you souls. This is my wish for you. May you be healed  in every way and lifted in the love of God. 
 
With all my love and blessings from Above and from all here who love you. I shall say goodbye for now but will come again. 

May God bless you and hold you in His loving arms. I am your sister in Christ, I am Clare.
