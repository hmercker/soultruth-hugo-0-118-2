# The Progression of the Soul towards the Light

I come, I am your brother in the love of God, Yogananda. When one considers the vastness of creation, the universes of the macrocosmos, the universes of the microcosmos, the complexity and perfection leaves one awestruck and perhaps in wonder of how the smallest and most obscure is as wonderful as the largest and most obvious in all of creation. Those whose souls are not engaged with the love of God, there is a type of, let me say, a kind of void, a lack of purpose, and quite often those souls find themselves in darkness, in depression, without hope, without faith and in need of love. You, my friends, my beloved friends, whose souls are engaged with the Creator, you have an eternal connection, and you can share this connection with those in need by simply loving them. For the farther they are from this connection and perhaps even completely under the influence of darkness, they are the most in need. 

Those who reside in the lower worlds, when they can open to the smallest ray of hope and light, they are changed, and they begin to be healed. A progression of soul towards light from the darkness begins and gratitude ensues from those who were once hopeless. As you may know, in spirit, souls are lifted up by those in a higher state and when lifted up, they in turn lift others. It is the same on earth when for those who were once considered evil may one day be saints. When the spark of love is allowed and touches them, there is no end to the progression that may come about. The heart that is touched and changed becomes a heart of empathy, of compassion, wishing to serve and knowing that as they have been helped and brought into love and light, their service will do so in kind for others. And, thus, everything in the universe, in creation, is moving towards light and love and progression and transformation, whether in the natural or in the magnificence of the divine.
 
You know the song *‘what the world needs now is love’.* It is as true now as it ever was and you, my dear friends, who have this love can bring this to the world and so it is. Whether you be few or many, you walk with the angels and you are never alone in the love of God. You are never without help. You are never without hope. So, beyond the words and all the rituals and manifestations is the connection between heaven and earth, which is Divine. As we step back, in the stillness, in the presence of God and the company of countless angels, we bring together the microcosmos and the macrocosmos in the song of love, the uni-verse. Let your song be love. Let your hearts be filled. Allow the love of God to permeate your being as we walk this path in the humbleness and gratitude and bliss in the love of God. May all be blessed. You are dear to the Heavenly Father and dear to us. 
  
I shall step back in this prayer, in this bliss, in this love. I am Yogananda. May God bless you.
