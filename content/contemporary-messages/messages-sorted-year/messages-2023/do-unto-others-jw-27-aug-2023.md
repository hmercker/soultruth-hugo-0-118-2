It is I, Care. My dear friends, what a joy to be in this circle with you. Such kindred souls, such sweetness, the beauty of the melodies coming from each one, a reflection of the love they carry. I think all of you can recall or bring to mind the feeling you have when you’re going to meet up with an old friend, someone you have loved and who loves you for many years, perhaps someone you have not seen in a long time, and you are filled with anticipation and without a doubt can already feel that soul’s love for you and yet equally as magnificent is meeting up with someone in forgiveness, someone you have had a falling out with, who has forgiven you, or one you have forgiven, and the healing that comes to your heart in the embrace and the reconciliation with that one is such a beautiful thing. Hence, the words of the master *“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”.* Such a simple… such a simple thing, and yet how we all forget. 
    
So, as you come into this prayer, each one, opening their hearts, reaching into their soul’s longings to receive the great gift, and allowing the inflowing of God’s grace into your souls, all is forgiven. This great gift, beyond any reconciliation, but also embracing it, is yours and how we love to come when you call. So, I just wanted to speak through my beloved today and remind you that for me, this was also an admonition that I had to take to heart on earth, whenever discord wanted to rule, whenever a blessing was being disturbed. For you all know in your souls the power of God’s love is greater than a thousand evils, a thousand distractions, any vexation, because you are lifted above and you embrace, in His love, all. My love to each one of you, very special, very beautiful souls of my life on earth, now here in the celestial kingdom, where forever we are connected. May God bless you, each one. I am your sister and eternal friend. I am Care.
