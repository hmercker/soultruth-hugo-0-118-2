# You Are all Forerunners of Bringing Love and Truth to the World

March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Confucius received by Al Fike

My friends, I am your teacher and friend, Confucius. There are many from the world of spirit who gather around you at this time and you have been brought to a place, a gathering place, high above the Earth plane. Each of you are there in your spirit bodies. Though some of you feel firmly planted upon the earthly plane, I assure you that you are part of this gathering. Indeed, we all gather together to honour our friend. Indeed, we will honour him for all eternity, will we not? For it is his choice and effort to bring the truth of Godâ€™s Love through him to humanity. Did not our beloved brother, Jesus, choose well in this great effort? For, indeed, what came through him is full of truth. The books that are published from this glow in light. Some are able to see this and recognise it. So many, so many have benefitted from these efforts. And you have, many of you have.

So, I acknowledge you, my friends. I see you as the forerunners to a great movement, a great effort in your world to eradicate the conditions of error and darkness and bring forth light and truth. May you be successful in your ventures. For God has you firmly in His embrace, and God will continue to protect you and guide you in these efforts.

My friends, beautiful children of God, may you be blessed. May you be blessed, deeply blessed. God bless you. Confucius loves you, beloved souls. I love you. You are loved by many and God loves you beyond measure. God bless you. I honour you all in love and truth.
