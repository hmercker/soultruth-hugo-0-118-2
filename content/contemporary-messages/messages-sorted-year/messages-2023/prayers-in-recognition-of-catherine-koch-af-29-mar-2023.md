# Prayers in Recognition of Catherine Koch

Received by Al Fike  



I come to support your prayer seeking the great gift that our Heavenly Father has to give, His Love shining forth amongst you, His Grace uplifting you, the healing peace surrounding you. I am your brother and friend, Jesus. I come to bless you in this prayer. I come to assure you that your dear sister<sup>1</sup> is in the light, that indeed, she was met by angels when she passed and uplifted and carried to her new world, that place beyond the physical realm.

My beloveds, be the light that this child was. Though each of you serve God in different ways, the light is the same. The love manifest is the same and this is the power of love manifest in service, in your efforts to do God’s Will. This is the light manifest in the world through you. May your footsteps be sure, beloved souls. May your souls grow in His Love. May that light within you beam forth into the world and may you be guided with each foot fall. Each effort that you make, may you be blessed by God and shown the way, the path that is in harmony with His plan and Will.
 
All who follow this path and seek the Love of God shall, in some way, make their mark upon the world. It may not be an expression that is obvious and dynamic, yet, nonetheless as each soul continues to grow in the Father’s love, so each will make a mark. They will add to the truth by their example, their being. Do not underestimate the power of your own gifts and abilities that are and can be amplified by God’s Touch of Love. In this, you become strengthened. You become wise. You come into alignment with God’s Will. And as you do so, the path is laid open to you.

The plan reveals that purposeful effort that you are destined to express will become clear, and you will find such joy and happiness in your journey of service, of expression of light. These things all come with the blessing of the Divine Love within your soul. Nothing is left to chance when you are in alignment with God. Rather, your life becomes a flow of service, of opportunities. A door is opening and possibilities realised because you have prayed to be a servant of God. You have found the ways and means to bring that prayer to fruition. Beloved souls, know that you are loved, that when that day comes when you pass into the world of spirit that you will be greeted by the angels and uplifted and acknowledged for the light you have been in the world.

God’s plan will continue to unfold with each of you. Do not doubt this but seek to know what that plan is for you. Seek to be in alignment with it. Seek to find your way toward greater light and service in love. In this way, all that is within your heart and soul, all that is in God’s Will for you, all that is that is of light will flow and manifest and be realised in your life. Be true to your souls, beloveds. Be true to all that is of truth. Be humble in your efforts but clear and forthright, that you may truly manifest God’s Will and be that instrument of light and peace, comfort and healing, love in everything that you do so that the world may benefit by your gifts, by your efforts, by your prayers. 

Be at peace, beloveds, the peace that passes all understanding and know the joy of a soul on its journey to redemption and transformation, at-onement with God. These things God promises you, provided you walk the path that declares the truth of His Love. Be at peace, beloveds, and know that I love you. I am Jesus, Master of the Celestial Kingdom, your brother, your friend, always. I am with you always, and I love you. God bless you. God bless you.
