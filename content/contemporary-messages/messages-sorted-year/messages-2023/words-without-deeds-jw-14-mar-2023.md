I am here your brother in Christ, I am Francis. 

In a world so busy acquiring material things, in a world so bereft of the connection to God, in a world where the spectrum of words from the profane to the sacred vies for your attention, I ask you to consider that when you hear or read or remember the words of the Master, the words of the Prophets, the Celestial Angels and those who are happy to guide you, that words without deeds, without actualizing the content, are simply words, beautiful as they may be. So, when you remember to walk in love and actualize the longing in your souls and bring those words to life, truly what you give to another in love, and most especially in God’s love changes them, and therefore changes the world. Just to lift up one soul is a deed forever treasured. 

So, yes pray, and listen to the advice of the Angels and the Master and then bring those words into your reality that you may bring light where there is darkness, that you may bring healing where there is hurt, that you may bring Faith where there is doubt, peace where there is anger, and love, always love. 
May the great love of God that lifts us all, that changes us be upon us in this prayer. And may God bless each one of you in the days ahead as you walk in this world being channels of God’s love and light. You are our hope, and we love you. I shall step back and join sacred circle in the grace of God. I am your brother and eternal friend in Christ. I am Francis. Go in peace.
