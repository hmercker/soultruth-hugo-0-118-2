# Make your priority to be in the now of God’s Love

I come in God’s love. I am Luke. My brothers and sisters in the love of God, this is a time of healing, a time of spiritual discernment, of releasing the need for judgement and embracing the diversity of souls. This is a time for substance over style. This is a time for appreciation over apprehension, gratitude over grievance. These things along with the love of God are a prescription for true happiness. 

Truly, we are one in the love of God. Truly, we are all His children. The human mind seeks answers. Its function is to discriminate and select and analyze that one may walk through this world, hopefully not bumping into too many walls, and learning life’s lessons so that one may grow. The human mind also loves to create ritual. It is in a sense a sentimental thing to wish to re-create something that at one time or another occurred spontaneously and some gift, some grace. was felt. And so, the mind attempts to re-create this and yet even in the attempt to re-create a blessing, because there is only now, it is never quite the same. Therefore, if you make your priority to be in the now of God’s love, the now of His Presence, there is not stasis but flow. There is progression. There is harmony and the conscious awareness of of the laws of God as intended. And yes, there is the peace, the great peace that passes understanding when one is in God’s love. 

If you allow your prayer to be your priority, all in-harmonies, all dissension, all division, dissolves in the great unity of this love Divine. Do you not feel this? Of course, you do. So, it is only a matter of the simple act of allowing everything else to fall away, that the longings in your souls may lift you so that God will bless you in your longing. This longing, whether spoken or simply felt, is true prayer. Allow your lives as many moments of true prayer as possible. I tell you, as your brother in Christ, this is the way. Every good, every perfect gift, every prayer is answered, and I may say, perfectly. I shall step back, and I thank my brother and I thank you all. May each one be blessed in the love of God. 
   
I am Luke.
