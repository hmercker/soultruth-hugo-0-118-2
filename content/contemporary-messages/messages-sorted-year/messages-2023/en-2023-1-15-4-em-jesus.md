Jesus received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here now. I am your brother and the first lover of our Father. I am Jesus, the Master of the Celestial Heavens and I come with my brothers and sisters from the Celestial Heavens to bring the grace of God and abundance into your presence and to lift you, to bring you closer to our Father. We bring you closer so that you may experience the love and conditions that you will be manifesting in the future as you continue along this path. We bring you love and blessings also from the Father. His love for you is great as is the love of our brothers and sisters in these Celestial Heavens.

Know how blessed you are, dear children of God. Know how blessed and loved you are. For that is your strength. That is your guide as you walk in this world from day to day among those souls who are still in darkness, who await your light to show them the way. For there are many who are searching, many who will look for you and when finding you, will rejoice. Their souls will leap with this joy. For they are hungry. They are hungry for the love, for the truth that God has to give them and you, my dear brothers and sisters, will show them. You will show them the way to receive this greatest gift that our heavenly Father wishes to bestow upon them and they will rejoice.

The love in this group is great. The love in each of your souls is growing stronger, greater and you have purpose, my dear brothers and sisters. Embrace this purpose. Ask God to show you and to bring to you those souls that you can serve best who desire to know God and yet, are lost in their way to find God. Open your souls now and ask the Father to bring those souls to you who are searching, longing, who are tired, who do not know and yet they do know that there is something, something missing. Teach them, my dear children, and most of all, love them with the love of the Father. I am your brother. We are many here today. We bless you. We love you. We encourage you and we desire to be of service to you. May the love of our Father pour upon you and help you open to receive all that God has for you. My love is with you. My love is with you, dear children of our Father. God bless you.
