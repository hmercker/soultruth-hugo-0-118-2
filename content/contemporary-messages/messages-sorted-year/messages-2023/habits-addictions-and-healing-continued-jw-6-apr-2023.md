# Habits, Addictions and Healing (continued) 

April 6<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  


I came the other day through my friend here because I was called, and I saw that the subjects of addiction and habits could be very helpful, so I addressed them. Many there are dealing with those issues with family and friends and seeing first-hand the deleterious effects of harmful addictions and lifetimes of injurious habits. Primarily I was speaking about drugs and alcohol, and I also mentioned in that message the importance of creating positive habits in children. There certainly is a wide spectrum to be considered. Healthy foods, prayer, physical activity, books, and stories that present not only a positive view of life as well as beautiful music, caring for the earth, and all the arts that include the qualities of empathy and compassion and the equality of all. Children who receive such education will have a better chance at navigating the darkness of the world, the dangers, the diseases, the challenges, and the direction in which the planet seems to be going from choices that are made which have been short-sighted. 
    
And so, the earth is in the regenerative process of healing. I ask you to be part of this healing, not in some great magnanimous gesture, but beginning by considering your own habits, though they may not be ones that are considered societal diseases such as alcoholism and so-forth. Consider the habit of prayer. Consider the habit of health, consider the habit of kindness in your daily interactions where you begin to see every soul as a precious child of God, and with the love in your soul, you are able to look past their in-harmonies, their beliefs, their dis-ease, their poverty, and perhaps their reluctance. 
    
All of you have made efforts to reach out and I admire this not only personally, but all of us here in spirit in the love of God appreciate every act done in love, every reaching out. When you give from the richness of your souls, you touch the poverty of spirit and uplift it. Much of the work that I do in spirit involves reaching out with empathy, compassion, and such deep love that those children who have never felt any of that begin to open up, begin to act upon their souls, beyond their fear, beyond the abuse they have suffered and when they can accept the kindness shown to them, they can begin to see how much God loves them and open to that love which as you know, transforms a soul. 
  
I have spoken more than I had intended to my brother’s surprise, but I thank you all and I have great faith in all of you and in the work you do. We all encourage you to share your gifts in the equality of God’s love, where we are One. With all my love and blessings, I thank you. I am your brother in Christ and the eternal friend of your soul. I am Fred Rogers. God bless you.
