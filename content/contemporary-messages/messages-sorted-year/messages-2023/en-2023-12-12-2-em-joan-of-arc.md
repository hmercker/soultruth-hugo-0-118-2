# Jeanne Encourages Us to Develop a Rapport with Our Guides

December 12<sup>th</sup>, 2023

One Nation Circle of Light, Liverpool, NY, USA

Joan of Arc received by Elizabeth Mack

I am here Jeanne d’Arc and I whisper in your ear today that you may hear only my voice for the Lord God has sent me to protect you, to love you, to pray with you, to uplift all of you, to bring you peace, to bring you closer, closer to the Celestial Heavens, closer that you may feel the warmth of the Father’s love and caress about you.

We truly love you children upon the Earth who seek the Father’s love. We speak to you and sometimes you listen and sometimes you cannot hear because of the noise and distractions about you. We ask that you pray to receive our guidance clearly, frequently, throughout your days so that we can keep you on a path that is designed for you for your progression, for your health, for your well-being. Come to listen to us as a routine for you may not hear us through another in times to come but you will feel us and if you will, you will hear us showing you which way to go, how to approach the next step in your life.

Open yourselves only to the inhabitants of the Celestial Heavens and those spirits who come from other planets who are sent here by God that you may know that you are loved and protected and so very taken care of. Take this in deeply, children, deeply into your souls that you may always know the truth of how well God’s children are taken care of.

I bless you today and every day and we welcome your individual questions of us, each one to your guide that you may develop a rapport that will be instrumental in your life going forward. I say this with all love and care that you not be concerned about your future. Simply open to us. Open your souls to God and we will take you by the hand and walk with you, each one of you. We are pleased at your efforts to speak to God and this may continue forever but include us in your prayers and we will come and sit by you as you pray and we will answer your questions because you are so beloved, so beloved by God that He has sent us, each to one of you, to be close. This is a blessing. This is a gift because God loves you more than you can realize at this time. We await your connection with us as your older more progressed siblings who are here to help you.

May you be open to God’s love and our guidance which comes from God. I love you. Many of us are here and we love you deeply. I am your sister, Jeanne and I will be with you for a while as not only your gatekeeper but as your guide and the guide of this circle. God bless you. God bless you. I am Jeanne and I am thrilled that my Father has sent me here.
