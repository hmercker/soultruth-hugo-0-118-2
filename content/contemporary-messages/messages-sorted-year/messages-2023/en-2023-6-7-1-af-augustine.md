Augustine received by Al Fike

Beloved souls, I am your teacher, Augustine. We do not provide this information, inspiration, messages of truth just for the hardy few that are present in our Circles of Light as you pray together. We do this for all in the world and you carry the banner, beloved souls. You are the ones who are being blessed because you are willing to overcome whatever obstacles may be in your course and to contribute to the Divine plan for the salvation of humanity.

So I honour you, beloved souls. I honour your dedications, I honour your souls, those of you who are willing to step forward. Each has their place, their role, and that role is no more or no less than another’s. Even this individual whom I speak through understands that there is an equality here amongst his brethren who are willing to support and to be a part of this beautiful effort. So we continue, my beloved and beautiful students of the truth, in this effort to break the barrier of ignorance and darkness in the world, to bring truth, simple and clear to many. Indeed, as you continue to reveal these missives of truth, so others have the opportunity to know them, to read them, to feel inspired, to draw to them the blessings of God and the angels as they clear away other detrimental aspects of their mind and allow and invite messages of truth to be entertained within them. It is a powerful way to help, uplift, enlighten and inspire many other souls.

So you have our gratitude. You have God’s blessing upon you, my beloved and beautiful friends of truth. So as you continue in your dedications, you also continue in your journey of enlightenment and truth. As your soul continues to seek the great gift of God’s Love, so you will open wider to all truth and know the joy of it, the wonderment of it, the beauty of it, God’s Love entering your soul, changing you forever. Beloveds, you are and shall be rewarded for your efforts, for these dedications are to God and God knows of your dedications. So, blessings are given, touch of Light is upon you. The angels are close and much is awakened through your efforts and through the blessings upon them.

May God bless you, beloved souls, keep you in the Light of His Love, keep you in the grace and harmony that comes as you dedicate yourself ever more fully to the Truth of God’s Love, to the way of God’s Love, to the expression of God’s Love within you. God bless you. My love is with you. Angels are with you. God’s Touch is upon you. I am your teacher, Augustine, and I come to acknowledge your efforts and to bring a blessing for each one of you. God bless you. God bless you all in the grace of His Love.
