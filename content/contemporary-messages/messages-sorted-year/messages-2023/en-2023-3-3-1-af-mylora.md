Mylora received by Al Fike

Blessings to you. I am your friend, Mylora. Yes, the Living Waters of God’s Love are the purest, most beautiful of all, and those Waters are the only waters that transform the soul. They are the blessings of God’s Essence, the flow of His Love continuing to push aside all the obstructions, all that which holds you back in the flow of God’s Love. May you allow yourself to be immersed in this flow, beloved souls, immersed in the Living Waters of God. In this way, you will know the joy, that lightness of being as you float along in His Will, His Love, His Light enveloping you, its soft caresses upon you, and how it will seep into every crack and fissure of your soul so that it may transform and awaken you.

Allow this to be so. For you are a part of this world, are you not? And as such, like everything within it, it needs its healing, its upliftment, to be washed clean of all that is not in harmony with its existence. So open yourself, beloved souls to the Living Waters of God and as you are transformed in these Living Waters you will be an agent of transformation and healing in the world. For as you are within the flow of these blessings so you are a conduit for this flow into the world. in this way, you are performing the highest good, the greatest duty and service to the world. For it is this transformative love that heals everything. It is this transformative love that transforms all that is not in harmony towards harmony, and in this way, it complies with the laws of God’s Creation.

May you walk within this great harmony and light and love. May you truly be His servants, the water bearer, he and she who carries the Light of the Essence of God, for it is within their lives and within their souls.  May you be at peace, beloveds. May you know the joy of God’s Touch as He showers you with Love, uplifts you in Light, cleanses you and transforms you. May God bless you. I am Mylora and I love you, each of you, beautiful souls. I love you and I am with you. I am with you. God bless you.
