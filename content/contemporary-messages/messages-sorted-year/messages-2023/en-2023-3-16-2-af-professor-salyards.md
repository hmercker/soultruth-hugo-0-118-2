# Guidance for Divine Love Celebration Global Gathering

March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Sechelt, BC, Canada

Prof Salyards received by Al Fike

Yes, your Professor Salyards is here. I applaud your efforts to plan and to continue to consider the variables and situations which you must encounter when organizing such a gathering as this.

It is good to listen to your guidance and the promptings that come. It is good to consider what issues may arise from such complicated matters as this Gathering. And it is good to communicate with as many as you can for you cannot assume that people understand or are clear about your intentions and the intentions of this Gathering. No matter how much you consider these things in your mind, my beloved and beautiful friends, it is important that you share your considerations, share the details so that others may know and be reassured. They are looking for reassurance at this time. They do not understand the place in which you are gathering and the complications that are involved with this place. There are fears that are arising and confusions that continue to enter the minds of your brothers and sisters. When you are clear yourselves as to how the flow and evolution of this Gathering may come together in harmony, then you must communicate these things and reassure your brothers and sisters.

It is one thing to say, oh, God will bring it together and will guide each individual to your doorstep. But in the case of this Gathering, our wish is that everyone that can come must come and be a part of this for there are many blessings, many things that will come of it. And so, do not put any roadblocks in the way of those who wish to come, rather encourage them, inform them, communicate with them. Though it may seem a long way off, you must understand that many are considering these things at this time and making their arrangements and committing their resources to coming. The sooner you have your communications ready, communications that are clear and detailed, available to them, the greater the possibility of their commitment will be and they will feel welcomed and excited in the anticipation of such a beautiful event.

Make this opportunity open, clear and decisive so that others may feel reassured and a part of what is a great invitation to pray together, to celebrate together, to form bonds of love, to strengthen the lattice of light, to bring brothers and sisters together in such a way that they feel they are a part of a great family of Love, to bring the truth of God's Love into the room where you gather, to bring the Angels close, to have free and open communication between us and yourselves, to have peace, and to clear away any misunderstandings among you so that there is unity and there is the power of the light of God's Love shining through each individual.

Prayer, joy, music, communications, breaking bread together - all of these things are simple, but your brothers and sisters must know that these are the intentions, this is what will be as you come together in such a Gathering. And so we ask you to be alert to these needs, questions and concerns at this time. Put your minds together in planning and organizing and we will be there to assist you. There will not be elements missing or great gaps in what is required. But indeed to procrastinate at this time would not be advisable. Now is the time to put your efforts together, to bring people together in planning and communicating and listening to their own inner guidance so that God's Will may be done, my friends, and that God's Will may be known and expressed among you. May you be truly in alignment with God's Will, in alignment with the truth of His Love, in alignment with all that is an expression of yourselves in harmony with God's Will, in harmony with your Angel friends, in harmony with all that is meant to be in this great effort and service to uplift many.

God bless you, my beloved friends, and keep you in His Love. Be open, listen, be aware and act in harmony with all that is required and asked of you. God bless you, my friends, I am Professor Salyards and I'm happy to speak to you today. Know that God's Love is with you, that you are truly loved, and that we gather about you in upliftment and guidance and light and blessings. God bless you, my friends, God bless you.
