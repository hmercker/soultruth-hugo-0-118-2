# In Heaven’s Arms You Shall Abide

March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2023

Spirit: Elizabeth Barrett Browning

Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A.

Received by Jimbeau Walsh  



Let your garden everchanging
 
Bring the blossoms rearranging 

In the glory everlasting 

Here where love hath no bounds 

Glory rides and light astounds 

As a prism colors come

Through the lens and then some 

 
Out of the blue unseen hues 

To leave one breathless and imbued 

In sacred love of endless shore 

Behold the love of evermore

And though I speak as through a mist 

Know these words are not adrift 

But set on sails of the Spirit
 
Wind on the spirits breeze 

Where my heart abides forever free 

How can you know what is to come

Except to say May His will be done 

Ah my friends tis my delight 

To light a candle every night 

The flame of love

So pure so bright

So let us be as one in love 

Never-ending from God above 

And may our hearts be brought to rest

On Mother Earth her loving breast

Unto the time when you shall rise 

From mortal coil with open eyes

Into the realm beyond the skies 

In Heavens arms you shall abide

In wonder here no more to roam

Your restless heart forever home

Free to explore in mighty realm 

All that is creations helm

Let me say at last to thee

In faith you come in hopes to be

One day upon Celestial shores 

You shall arrive as spirit soars
 
Unto His own in recompense 

Where all is love in Spirits sense
 
A soul perceived and understood 

God is great God is good.
