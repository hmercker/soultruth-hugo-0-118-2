May the great blessings of God’s Love befall upon your souls, beloved children of God. I come, I am your brother, I am your friend, I am Jesus. I come because you are my brothers and sisters, truly. You carry the truth of God’s Love within your hearts and souls. You are truly His children and truly my brethren. 

You come together for the benefit and welfare of your own souls. Yes, you may pray for the world, you may pray for your loved ones, you may pray for many. Yet the focus and the power of your prayers must be for your own soul. For how else can you enter into the world as a light if you are not a light, if you have not considered your growth and awakening that comes with the Father’s Love pouring within? 

I could not do my work, my ministry without the awakening that came to me in prayer. At times I would retreat from the world and replenish myself in prayer. Here, God has given you the opportunity to be replenished, to drink of His Living Waters, to drink deep, to be in His Grace. Do not look upon this opportunity with a casual perspective. I urge you to take seriously what is being given. The yearning of your soul must come forth, even if it is painful, even if that part of you that is yearning is also crying out to God in your pain. I say to you, open yourselves fully, powerfully, to the inflowing of God’s Love through His Holy Spirit that will touch you deeply. In this way you will find yourself within the holy rapture of God’s Touch. You will be awakened by the deep and powerful touch of His Soul to yours. 

My beloveds, this is what I have come to teach and I continue to come and teach my brothers and sisters. Whether that be on the Earth or in the spirit world, I continue to come and teach this truth. For it is the highest blessing, the greatest truth of all. It is set before you at your feet, given by God in such mercy, desire and abundance that it is for you to merely reach out to that blessing and receive it fully. 

Are you focused, my beloved friends? Are you here together, truly here together in the desire to receive? Are you in love with God? Are you in love with your own soul? All these aspects of yourself crying out in need of nurturance, in need of love? My beloveds, God has great love for each one of you no matter what your life has been in the past. God’s desire is that all shall be transformed and changed in the truth of His Love. In this way, you will find redemption, you will find joy, you will be awakened in love. All shall change, my beloveds. All shall change within you and all pain will be replaced with joy and knowing and true understanding of the soul. It is here. It is here, my beloveds. 

I beseech you, I beg of you, ask for this love. Open yourself to this gift and all else shall be given unto you in accordance with the Laws of Love and the blessings of God. It awaits you. Put aside all your worries and cares, all that concerns you on this earthly plane. For now we will be uplifted into the light and bliss of God’s Love. Awaken to this, my beloveds. In this you will know the truth. You will know all that we have beseeched you to know in this experience, in this communion with God. The great Love that He gives to each one of you shall be profound and bring to you all that you require to know the truth, to be in the grace of God’s Touch and thus a light, another light shining bright within the world. 

It is given, the gift is given. Drink deep, beloveds. Drink deep and know truly within your heart that God loves you so. There is no greater truth. You will know from this truth many things and all will be in harmony with the laws of His Love. We are together in His grace. The light pours upon you, and the light pours into your world. The light touches many, but most of all the light must touch you deeply, profoundly. Release all barriers, all that would hold you back from God. Open yourself, feel the tenderness and vulnerability of your own soul seeking the comfort of its Creator. In this you open the passageway, the flowing of love into you. Seek it now. Open yourself. Be that innocent child of God and be in the light of His Touch. 

I am with you, beloveds, with you in your struggles, with you in your trials, with you with each day that you continue to seek the Truth and Love of God. So I shall be with you always. For my love for you is great. I truly am your brother and shall be for all eternity, beloved souls. May the grace be with you. God bless you. God bless you, my beloveds. Sweet peace upon you, the nectar of God’s Love within you, the light 
burning bright within you. It is a gift to each of you and it shall sustain you. God bless you. I am Jesus and I love you.
