# Jesus' messages to the World

In late September 2020 Jesus announced that he would use Al Fike to deliver a series of teachings. He had chosen Al because of several factors not least of which were Al's efforts to reach and maintain a high spiritual level that allows a very good rapport with Jesus and other Christed spirits. After the completion of Volume I, Jesus announced his intention to continue with another volume in the series. In June 2022 the third volume was announced.

[Volume I - Our World in Transition, Messages from Jesus](/jesus-teachings/volume-i/)

[Volume II - Finding Our Way Home](/jesus-teachings/volume-ii/)

[Volume III - Awakening to Soul Consciousness](/jesus-teachings/volume-iii/)
