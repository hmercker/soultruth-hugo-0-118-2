# Jesus' messages to the World - Volume IV

In .. Jesus announced that he would use Al Fike to deliver a fourth volume of teachings.

There can be a delay after receiving these messages before they appear in print. But we now have [a podcast page](https://divinelovesanctuary.podbean.com/?s=Teachings) that has the messages very soon after the audio file is distributed.
